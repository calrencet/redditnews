The Czech security services have reached this conclusion, Prime Minister Andrej Babis and Minister of Foreign Affairs Jan Hamacek announced on Saturday.

In response to the investigation results, the country has decided to expel 18 Russian embassy officials who would also work for the Russian secret services. They have 48 hours to leave the Czech Republic. “The explosion caused enormous material damage, serious danger and disruption for many local residents,” emphasized Babis. “The Czech Republic is a sovereign state and must respond appropriately to these research results.”

In October 2014, an ammunition depot exploded in Vrbetice, killing two Czechs. Two months later, a second explosion took place at another ammunition warehouse, also in Vrbetice. It is not immediately clear why Russia would have provided for this storage location.",156,1007,4,26

0,A Gun Bill | No Police State,https://nopolicestate.net/2007/12/21/a-gun-bill-3/,"There was a headline in the news yesterday on the Yahoo homepage that read “Gun bill inspired by “A place where gun violence occurred”, and the article went on to say something about the mentally ill will be targeted and asked for documentation when they go to buy guns. Hugh? Is not the problem with guns that guns are sold everywhere to anyone at all, and not the people.

And there was a sales excerpt in this past weeks Sunday newspaper for a sports store. This advertisement was for the hunting section of their store and it pictured a man dressed in camouflage with a gun tossed over his shoulder and there were photos of guns and rifles with brand names and fancy descriptions for sale all over the page. Are people animals who are people to be hunted? Is hunting for animals and people now considered a sport to be sold in the malls of America and on sales brochures next to roller skates and advertised in the papers for all to see. Is this not the same? Is not the problem that the images of guns are found in television, film, commercials, posters, newspapers, cartoons, video games and marketing and advertisements everywhere these days. Does not advertising influence society.

I could cut and paste my blog entries over and over in my appeal to abolish guns. Guns are the worst invention of an industry ever. Everyday someone loses their lives to random acts of gun violence for no reason at all except for the fact that guns have been invented. It is a story that has been told yesterday and will be told tomorrow with no end in sight. It is an industry that feeds on itself, advertisement breeds crime which breeds news, which breeds crime, which breeds more advertisement which breeds more crime. Will the cycle of the beast that has it’s grip on humanity ever end. Should not guns be abolished from humanity as a whole, from everyone on the face of planet earth.

And then there is that constitutional 4th amendment, the right to bear arms that should be abolished or rewritten to abolish guns and replace them with sticks and stones or something. The idea that property, material goods are worth more than life. And the whole world is paying with the loss of human life which seems to be a disposal commodity in the war industry of people against humanity. Occupy the nra.

And my friend gave me a flyer as we were discussing the latest atrocity of the day in relation to gun violence. It is a flyer she received back in April at Union Square Park of New York City. And it is a flyer about gun violence and psychiatry. The Pharmaceutical industry is bigger than the war industry. Psychiatry Kills. Abolished forced psychiatric treatment. And what’s that “One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest” film by Ken Kesey all about anyway. That’s a whole another blog posting. For all things human rights and psych cia trickery and alternatives to the mental death system, Mindfreedom is a great website to visit. I am one voice, one blogger. Is another world possible. Peace on earth and goodwill to all mankind. And what does this have to do with a No Police State?

And the flyer went on to read:

What caused the tragedy in “this state”?

It was reported in the Times and the Post Wednesday:

The killer had been taking anti-depressants.

All too often in the present age, we hear the tragic news of a senseless massacre somewhere in the country. Experience has shown, that the killer has almost always, if not absolutely always, been someone who had been prescribed anti-depressants.

The killers with names were kids who had been prescribed the anti-depressant ritalin.

The man who shot someone at this place had been prescribed an anti-depressant whose classic symptom is extreme rage directed at one specific person. The killers in the recent massacres in three different states, also one in another state, had been taking various prescription anti depressants.

Pharmaceutical drugs are prescribed, not as a last resort but as a first thought, not hesitantly but hastily and with excess. They are not properly used, but abused, with no thought of the side effects of taking chemicals which nature did not produce and evolution did not plan for us to be subjected to, like bug spray or insecticide. And this is not a small and isolated phenomenon, but rather a deliberate and systematic poisoning of the bodies and minds of the American people, on an epidemic scale.

The concentration of power, Mr. Moneybags, the State, which controls the American military-industrial complex and the pharmaceutical chemical companies that are an integral part of that system, the State, which, as Eisenhower warned, would one day gain undue influence and endanger our Liberties, has an interest in promoting this epidemic scourge of prescription drug use. Hundreds of billions of dollars a year, are made by the corporations that sell these drugs. It is big business. In addition, the State which experience has shown, for thousands of years all over the globe, tends to want to empower itself and dis-empower the People, gets exactly that benefit from this epidemic of drug use. Power and authority, competency and incompetency breeds corruption. It dis-empowers individuals by making them unhealthy. And it dis-empowers the community and the nation, by making people distrustful of each other; by making people think that their neighbor is a crazy person who they must be protected from; by persuading the People to accept, even to demand, increased police power of the State to protect them. Under such conditions even the will to independence vanishes.

The innovations of scientists and engineers are stolen and subverted by the concentrations of power; a virtue has become a vice, and chemical technology, which can and of right ought to be a liberating force in society, becomes enslaving.

Doctors are encouraged, by the drug industry, to prescribe artificial drugs to their patients. It is a regular practice, for the drug companies to pay a doctor a fee every time that doctor prescribes one of their drugs. It is no secret. In this way, the basic essential character of the American medical profession becomes one of conflict of interest.

The companies that make these drugs exert a great deal of pressure upon the mass media. There are huge advertising contracts, and there is an overlap of ownership between the drug companies and the media companies. The fact that a mass murderer was taking prescription drugs, is one of those things that will show up once in the newspapers, but is immediately and finally buried, and mum becomes the word.

There have been a thousand analyses of the killer in papers, of his history, his personality, his psychological problems; there have been a thousand demands for increased police powers; there have been a thousand calls for the outlawing of guns, and a general de-clawing of the People. But has anyone asked, how is it that society produces so many sick people?

Prescription anti-depressants are known to be a common cause of suicide; they are known to be a constant presence in senseless massacres. Surely the number of individual murders caused by these drugs must be many times greater than the number of massacres. And if there are so many suicides and murders, how many people taking pharmaceuticals must be gravely suffering, but have not quite yet arrived at the point of suicide or murder?

This epidemic of drug use, this deliberate poisoning of the bodies and minds of the American people, this deliberate, and thus far largely successful, did-empowerment of the American people, must stop. It is our purpose to reveal this truth to the American people, so that we may once again live in a sane and healthy society and the tragic deaths of so many good people in this State shall not have been in vain.

0,University of Cape Town on fire,https://www.news24.com/amp/news24/southafrica/news/uct-evacuates-students-as-runaway-veldfire-rages-on-20210418,"A City of Cape Town firefighter sustained burn wounds while battling a blaze at Rhodes Memorial.

Table Mountain National Park (TMNP) said an initial investigation showed a vagrant's fire may have sparked the blaze.

UCT has evacuated its students and announced it was cancelling campus activity on Monday and Tuesday.

A firefighter sustained burn wounds while battling the massive fire that raged at Rhodes Memorial on Sunday, spreading down to the University of Cape Town, which was forced to evacuate approximately 4000 students.

According to the City of Cape Town's Fire and Rescue Services, the firefighter was transported to a nearby hospital for treatment.

Fire crews were expected to work throughout the night on the scene of the mountain fire behind the University of Cape Town (UCT). At present, the City has more than 150 of its firefighters on the scene from various stations across the metropole, working alongside the Table Mountain National Parks (TMNP) staff, Working on Fire and the Volunteer Wildfire Services.

According to the TMNP, an initial investigation showed the blaze might have been sparked by a vagrant.

""It should be noted that due to the extreme fire danger index for today - which is red with temperatures of 36 degrees noted and an extremely low relative humidity of under 10% - the fire spread rapidly in the direction of Rhodes Memorial.""

The veldfire has destroyed parts of the Rhodes Memorial Restaurant and Tea Garden located on the mountain's slopes. As the fire spread, the TMNP urged all hikers within the Newlands and Rhodes Memorial area to evacuate with immediate effect.

UCT evacuates students

The fire spread to the veld above the UCT upper campus, damaging buildings and forcing the university to evacuate approximately 4000 students.

All academic activity at the University of Cape Town has been suspended on Monday and Tuesday. While its still unclear the full extent of the damage, the fire has damaged the HM Pearson, Fuller and Jagger Library buildings.

UCT Vice-Chancellor Professor Mamokgethi Phakeng said, ""The safety of students and staff is paramount. For safety reasons, the campus will be locked down, and no one other than emergency services will be allowed access. We are all anxious about the extent of the damage to the Rondebosch campus. We will provide updates as soon as we are able to do so.""

She said food and emergency accommodation has been arranged for all the students who had to be evacuated on Sunday.

""The necessary arrangements have also been made to accommodate our Muslim students. Food will be prepared at Old Mutual’s offices in Pinelands, Cape Town, and from there it will be distributed to the locations where we are accommodating our students. The public has been asked to donate any essential items and food they may wish to contribute at Old Mutual West Campus, 91 Jan Smuts Road, Pinelands, and Cape Town. The site will be open until 23:00 tonight [Sunday] and will re-open at 06:00 tomorrow morning [Monday].""

The Mostert Mill below UCT's upper campus also set alight during the fire and was gutted. The mill is a historic landmark that was constructed in 1796 on what was once known as Welgelegen farm. It is a Cape truncated-cone tower mill and is characterised by its thatch roof.

Caution urged

Disaster Risk Management spokesperson Charlotte Powell said at this stage, they have asked residents to be cautious.

""Close all windows and doors to prevent drafts and reduce heat. Should there be an immediate threat to your property, damp down your garden using a hose or irrigation system.""

She added Disaster Risk Management was monitoring the situation closely.

""Wildfire creates smoky conditions, so it's important for everyone to reduce exposure to smoke. Wildfire smoke irritates your eyes, nose, throat and lungs. Children, pregnant women, people living with asthma and heart disease need to be especially careful,"" Powell said.

""One of the major contributors to the rapid rate of spread was the very old pine trees and their debris. The fire created its own wind that further increased the rate of spread. The excessive amount of smoke and related updrafts made it impossible for the aerial support to slow the rate of spread,"" said Table Mountain National Park's (TMNP) fire manager Philip Prins.

Meanwhile, the Cape of Good Hope SPCA has inspectors monitoring the situation.

""It is currently unsafe to enter the area. Once it is safe, our team will search the area for injured or distressed wild animals,"" the organisation said on its Facebook page.",750,4565,6,31
0,Israel ends outdoor mask mandate,https://nypost.com/2021/04/18/israel-ends-outdoor-mask-mandate/,"Israel ended its outdoor mask mandate Sunday, now that about 80 percent of its adult population has received both doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, reports said.

“Being without a mask for the first time in a long time feels weird. But it’s a very good weird,” Amitai Hallgarten, 19, told Reuters.

“If I need to be masked indoors to finish with this, I’ll do everything I can.”

At the start of the pandemic last year, Israel required residents to wear face coverings while they were outside as long as they weren’t exercising. But now that close to 5 million people in Israel have received the two-dose vaccine, health officials are starting to ease restrictions, Reuters reported.

“The rate of infection in Israel is very low thanks to the successful vaccine campaign in Israel, and therefore it is possible to ease [restrictions],” Health Minister Yuli Edelstein said in a statement.

In January, Israel was grappling with about 10,000 new infections a day but amid a surge of vaccinations, that number has dropped to about 200 daily and hospitalizations and deaths are nearly non-existent, France 24 reported.

While the end of masking up outside is a positive step forward to getting back to normal, the country is still requiring anyone who enters the country, including citizens, to self-isolate.

The country’s health ministry noted that there are seven cases of a new Indian variant and they are still assessing the impact it may have on transmission.

“We are leading the world right now when it comes to emerging from the coronavirus,” Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters.

“[But] we have still not finished with the coronavirus. It can return.”",277,1682,5,32

The country's health ministry said the crash happened about 40 kilometres (25 miles) outside the capital.

Over 55 ambulances were dispatched to treat the injured, the ministry said, and investigators have been sent to assess the accident's cause.

The train was set to travel to the northeast city of Mansoura.

About eight carriages overturned, according to local officials

Reuters news agency said eight carriages had overturned, citing a post on the province's verified Facebook page.

The state-run Ahram daily reported that authorities have detained at least 10 railway officials, including the train driver and his assistant.

A video on social media purported to show the train lying on its side and widespread debris. This footage has not been independently verified by DW.

In March, two trains collided in the Sohag Governorate in Egypt, killing 18 people and injuring at least 200 others.

Egypt sees frequent crashes on its railway system due in part to poor maintenance and lack of investment.

One of the deadliest train disasters happened in 2002 when 373 people died after a fire broke out on a train travelling south of Cairo.

0,Mexico: Online Free Speech at Risk,https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/04/14/mexico-online-free-speech-risk,"Click to expand Image In this Dec. 18, 2020 file photo, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador gives his daily morning news conference at the presidential palace in Mexico City. On January 14, 2021, López Obrador vowed to lead an international effort to combat what he considers censorship by social media companies that blocked or suspended the accounts of Former US President Donald Trump. © 2020 AP Photo/Marco Ugarte, File.

(Washington, DC) – Mexican Senate Majority Leader Ricardo Monreal’s proposed bill to regulate social media networks could severely restrict free speech in Mexico, Human Rights Watch said today. The bill would require companies to censor broadly defined categories of online content in violation of international norms currently in force. Senator Monreal should withdraw his proposal.

On February 8, just a few weeks after social media networks like Twitter and Facebook suspended the accounts of Former US President Donald Trump, Senator Monreal, who leads President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s party, Morena, in the Senate, published a draft bill on his website that would impose regulations on social media networks with users in Mexico. In January, President López Obrador had expressed his concern over the power of the networks to suspend Trump’s accounts.

“This bill would place the harshest restrictions on free speech that Mexico has seen in decades, opening the door to bans on social media networks and enabling the government to censor speech it disagrees with,” said José Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch. “Senator Monreal claims he wants to protect free speech in Mexico, but this bill would do exactly the opposite.”

The draft bill would make Mexico’s telecommunications and broadcasting regulator, the Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT), the final arbiter in disputes over content moderation, empowering it to overrule social media network operators’ decisions about how and when to delete a user’s content or suspend or cancel their account. And it would enable the IFT to punish social media network operators with fines of up to US $4.4 million if they fail to comply with its rules or if the IFT disagrees with their content moderation decisions. This could encourage further media concentration by forcing smaller companies to stop operating in Mexico altogether to avoid steep fines.

Under the bill, any social media network with one million or more users would need to obtain permission from the IFT to operate in Mexico. The IFT would be able to set rules about how social media networks operate and the types of content they can allow. And it would have the authority to review and change the networks’ terms of service, the rules that users must follow.

In effect, this would enable the IFT to prevent any social media network from operating in Mexico or prohibit users in Mexico from joining an “unauthorized” network, placing significant limits on freedom of expression. It could also encourage social media networks themselves to begin blocking users from Mexico to avoid the IFT review process.

The draft bill would also require social media networks to censor certain types of speech, such as “hate messages,” “fake news,” and any other type of speech the IFT deems should be censored to preserve “order and public interest.” The bill does not provide clear guidelines on what these terms mean, however, requiring social media network operators or the IFT to make determinations about whether statements are true or false. These requirements could lead to arbitrary censorship of legitimate content, enabling the government to force social media networks to censor content it disagrees with. This would be inconsistent with the prohibition on prior censorship in the American Convention on Human Rights.

Finally, the bill would prohibit social media networks from moderating the content on their platforms for reasons that the bill does not specifically mention, such as to prevent spam. This would restrict the ability of social media networks to make reasonable decisions about what kind of content they allow. Social media networks focused on specific groups, subjects, or interests, such as environmental issues or Indigenous culture, would be unable to operate.

Protecting free speech on the internet, ensuring that private entities do not interfere with that freedom, and giving people the ability to appeal restrictions on their speech are legitimate goals. But under international human rights law, Mexico has a responsibility to promote a “free, independent, and diverse communications environment,” and an obligation to ensure that any restriction on speech is necessary and proportionate to achieve a legitimate purpose. This includes regulation of speech through “indirect methods or means,” such as government controls over media companies.

Under international human rights standards, Mexico should not pass laws against so-called “fake news” or other “vague and ambiguous ideas,” or impose unnecessary or disproportionate restrictions on social media networks or online content. Instead it should promote media diversity and digital literacy. It should also incentivize companies to be transparent about their content moderation policies and to offer remedies for users whose accounts are suspended so that they can make their own choices about which platforms to use and how.

“Senator Monreal’s proposal is nothing more than censorship—pure and simple. It violates international legal standards by allowing the Mexican government to restrict access to certain websites and to decide what content social media users can and can’t share,” Vivanco said. “Imposing these kinds of heavy-handed regulations will stifle free speech, not protect it.”",892,5766,6,34
0,Turkish drones now in the Donbass.,https://tass.com/politics/1277251,"MOSCOW, April 13. /TASS/. The emergence of Turkish drones in Donbass in eastern Ukraine isn’t giving Moscow anything to be enthusiastic about, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Tuesday.

""Obviously, there can hardly be anything to rejoice about given that Turkish drones, as the story goes, are surfacing somewhere in Donbass,"" the senior Russian diplomat said.

Turkish exports to various countries are ""a serious issue,"" he pointed out. ""They buy something from us and ship their products elsewhere. Corresponding arrangements exist, including export controls where all these things are discussed. Through bilateral channels, we are also looking at an entire range of such episodes and will continue doing so,"" the high-ranking diplomat pledged.

At the same time, Russia and Turkey have ""normal and versatile relations"" and discuss all the bilateral issues ""in a working procedure,"" he pointed out.

0,Iran: Israel stole nuclear archive,https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20210417-iran-israel-stole-nuclear-archive/,"A senior Iranian official has admitted that Israel stole the archive of his country's nuclear programme in an alleged Mossad operation carried out in 2018, Israeli newspaper The Jerusalem Post reported on Thursday.

Momeen Rezaei, advisor to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, told Iran's Mehr News Agency on Wednesday that the country needs a major revamp of its security.

""The country has been widely exposed to security violations, and the example is that in less than a year, three security incidents have occurred: two explosions and one assassination,"" explained Rezaei.

He added: ""Before this, documents from our entire nuclear [archive] have been stolen, and before that, a few suspicious drones came and did some work.""

When Mossad smuggled the nuclear archive out of Iran in 2018, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented the alleged evidence that Iran aimed to develop a nuclear weapon. Iran denied this.

Iran nuclear negotiator Abbas Araghchi called Netanyahu's claims at the time: ""A very childish and even a ridiculous play.""

Mohammad Marandi, one of Iran's negotiators in the 2015 nuclear deal, stated that Israel had ""fabricated evidence"".

Rezaei expressed that this week's attack on Natanz was ""a bad event in terms of prestige"" and that ""they did it to break our resistance in diplomacy.""

0,"US, EU threaten to sanction Somalia",https://www.dw.com/en/us-eu-threaten-to-sanction-somalia/a-57216652,"Somalian President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed has signed a controversial law extending his mandate for two more years despite international criticism.

In a statement, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken warned that ""such actions would be deeply divisive, undermine the federalism process and political reforms that have been at the heart of the country's progress.""

It also jeopardizes ""partnership with the international community, and divert attention from countering Al-Shabab.""

Blinken further said the US was ""deeply disappointed"" and warned that President Mohamed's actions could erode the progress toward peace made in tandem with the international community.

The top US diplomat said the implementation of the law would compel his country to consider sanctions or other steps such as visa restrictions.

European Union's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell also threatened ""concrete measures"" without an immediate return to talks on holding elections.

The United Nations Mission in Somalia (UNSOM), in a joint statement with EU nations, regional IGAD bloc, and the United Kingdom, said it was ""deeply concerned"" and would not support the extension.

In Mogadishu, political and constitutional expert Aweys Salat, said the extension of the president's term was unconstitutional.

""It seems the president ignores that every resolution or law requires approval of both houses of parliament, the senate and the house of representatives,"" Salat told DW. ""The residents in the capital Mogadishu are tired of war, and they are asking politicians to respect the constitution.""

Regional observers have also warned that Somalia's current political crisis could deal a blow to efforts to stabilize the fragile state after decades of civil war and an Islamist insurgency.

Somali legislators of the lower house unanimously voted to extend President Mohamed's government for two years

Somalia hits back at 'foreign allies'

Somalia has accused some of its foreign backers of undermining its sovereignty amid the threat of sanctions.

""While we appreciate the concerns of our friends and international partners for Somalia's stability and security, it is regrettable to witness champions of democratic principles falling short of supporting the aspirations of the Somali people to exercise their democratic rights,"" the country's Foreign Ministry said.

""Inflammatory statements laden with threats, which undermine the political independence and sovereign rights of national institutions, will only serve to embolden terrorist organizations and anti-peace elements in Somalia,"" the ministry's statement added.

Somalia's president, best known by the name Farmajo, and the leaders of the country's five semi-autonomous federal states had reached an agreement in September on indirect parliamentary and presidential elections in late 2020 and early 2021.

But it fell apart over how to conduct the vote, and multiple rounds of talks have failed to break the impasse. The new law paves the way for a one-person, one-vote election in 2023, the first such direct poll since 1969, the year dictator Siad Barre led a coup before ruling for two decades.

A presidential election was due to have been held in February. It was to follow a complex indirect system used in the past in which special delegates chosen by Somalia's myriad clan elders pick lawmakers, who in turn choose the president.

A 'constitutional crisis'

Abdi Hashi Abdullahi, the senate speaker, has slammed the move as unconstitutional and said it would ""lead the country into political instability"" and pose security risks.

A coalition of opposition presidential candidates in a joint statement called it ""a threat to the stability, peace and unity"" of the country.

""There is now a constitutional crisis in the country as the senate, or upper house speaker, rejects the extension for the president and the lower house. The fear of chaos, suspension among the politicians, is too high now in Mogadishu and other parts of the country,"" Salat, the constitutional expert, told DW.

Mogadishu residents are worried that the political crisis might plunge the country into turmoil

Somalis speak out

While some in Mogadishu welcomed the extension of Abdullahi Mohamed's government for another two years, others are apprehensive that the extension could plunge the country into a political crisis.

""I think the two-year extension is needed. The president has done a lot of good things in the past four years. The president tried to hold the elections, but some politicians and regional states have crippled the process. If all political actors agree, we hope to have popular elections or a one-man-one-vote election in the next two years,"" Ilyas Nor told DW.

But for Shub'eyb Omar ""the extension for the president and parliament is unacceptable.""

""The president failed to have elections in the country under his legitimate four-year term. Both the president and the parliament need to rethink about this unlawful power extension,"" Omar said.

Jamuria Ahmed, a mother of two, told DW: ""I'm happy with the extension for the president and the parliament by two years since the regional states and the central government were unsuccessful in ending the impasse on the clan-based indirect elections. We need to participate in the one-man-one-vote elections. There are political spoilers in the country who do not want to let our nation move forward.""

""My message to the Somali leaders and intellectuals in Mogadishu is to calm down and compromise for the interest of the people and solve all issues through dialogue. There are significant improvements and developments in our country, especially in Mogadishu, and we need to seize this opportunity, which is for everyone's interest,"" Nor Hassan, another Mogadishu resident, told DW.

Al-Shabaab militants in Somalia could take advantage of the crisis and carry out attacks

Somalia's complex politics

Somalia has not had an effective central government since the collapse of Barre'smilitary regime in 1991, which led to decades of civil war and lawlessness fueled by clan conflicts.

The country also still battles Al-Shabab, an al-Qaida-linked Islamist militant group. The group controlled Mogadishu until 2011 when African Union troops pushed it out.

Al-Shabab retains parts of the countryside and targets the government, military and civilians in attacks in Mogadishu and regional towns.

Somalia still operates under an interim constitution, and its institutions, such as the army, remain rudimentary, backed up with international support.

The 59-year-old President Mohamed was wildly popular when he came to power in 2017. The veteran diplomat and former prime minister, who lived off and on for years in the United States, had vowed to rebuild a country that was once the world's most notorious failed state.

However, observers say he became mired in feuds with federal states in a bid for greater political control, hampering the fight against Al-Shabab, which retains the ability to conduct deadly strikes both at home and in the region.

In February, some opposition leaders attempted to hold a protest, which led to an exchange of gunfire in the capital.

0,The global fight against snake bites,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210413-how-rubber-boots-can-save-people-from-snake-bites,"""Every morning we find the snakes, look at what habitat they are in, whether they are shedding their skin or have just fed,"" he says. ""We are looking at how close they are to where people are working, where they are moving. It is giving us a lot more accurate information that we need to help tell people how to avoid and respect the snakes.""

Involving local people in this research has also been crucial as it is helping to overcome local resistance to the interventions they are attempting to introduce, says Bindumadhav. Farmers, for example, often prefer not to use boots or flashlights when working in the field as they impede their ability to move around or to do work quickly. Similar schemes to hand out boots in Africa have failed because villagers found the boots uncomfortable and as the rubber was valuable, they sold them off, says Albulescu. Boyer too has heard of similar problems.

For farmers like Tukaram Rao, knowing more about the snakes has helped to dispel much of the fear that surrounds them.

""Before this, we used to be very scared of snakes,"" he says. ""We used to run away on seeing a snake or not work in that area at all. Now we have some basic knowledge. For example, when we go to work, we use a stick to check the area before we start working.""

Rao had his own close encounter with a Russell's viper recently while walking from his house to secure his cows. ""I first noticed something shining in the pathway,"" he says. ""I asked my son to fetch a light and we drove it away.""

He hopes that as they learn more about Russell's vipers and their behaviour, it could ultimately allow his community to live alongside the snakes rather than in conflict with them.

""Many people used to kill snakes on sight,"" he says. ""But as we understand them better it could lead to fewer snakes being killed.""

Bindumadhav's ambitions are greater still. He wants to make the entire district around the village free from snake bite deaths. ""We are starting with a village,"" he says. ""But we hope to scale it out to other districts. Snakes are misunderstood creatures – there is no reason anyone has to die from them.""

0,Uefa furious at clubs' breakaway plan,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/56794673,"Last updated on .From the section European Football

Liverpool and Chelsea are understood to be part of the group that have signed up to a breakaway league

Uefa, the Premier League and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson have condemned 12 major European clubs, including the 'big six' from England, signing up to a breakaway European Super League.

Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham are part of the group.

La Liga's Atletico Madrid, Barcelona and Real Madrid and Serie A's AC Milan, Inter Milan and Juventus are involved.

Uefa said it will use ""all measures"" possible to stop the ""cynical project"".

Senior figures at European football's governing body are furious about the proposals.

Dion Dublin & Danny Murphy discuss the plans for a European Super League

Johnson said the plans would be ""very damaging for football"" and that the UK government supports the sport's authorities ""in taking action"".

He added: ""The clubs involved must answer to their fans and the wider footballing community before taking any further steps.""

The European Clubs' Association (ECA), which represents Europe's clubs, held an emergency meeting on Sunday in the wake of the reports.

BBC Sport understands none of the clubs mentioned in the Super League reports responded to a request to attend the meeting.

The meeting was chaired by Ajax chief executive Edwin van der Sar. Bayern Munich and Paris St-Germain were among the clubs who were present.

In a statement the ECA said it would be ""strongly opposed"" to a ""closed super league model"".

It has pushed plans for a 36-team Champions League, which Uefa had hoped would head off the formation of a Super League. The Champions League reforms are set to be confirmed on Monday.

BBC Sport was told last week of plans for some sort of confirmation about a European Super League.

Uefa released a joint statement, together with England's Football Association, the Premier League, the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), La Liga, and the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) as well as Serie A, on Sunday.

They said they will ""remain united"" in trying to stop the breakaway, using both judicial and sporting measures if required.

They also reiterated Fifa's stance that players taking part in the Super League would be banned from all other competitions at domestic, European or world level and could be prevented from representing their national teams.

In a separate statement, the Premier League said it condemned the proposal as it ""attacks the principles of open competition and sporting merit which are at the heart"" of domestic and European football.

Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said in a statement the government is ""concerned this plan could create a closed shop at the very top of our national game"".

He added: ""We have a football pyramid where funds from the globally successful Premier League flow down the leagues and into local communities.

A European Super League: The future of football?

""I would be bitterly disappointed to see any action that destroys that.""

Labour leader Keir Starmer said the clubs involved should ""rethink immediately"" or ""face the consequences of their actions"".

""This proposal risks shutting the door on fans for good, reducing them to mere spectators and consumers,"" he said.

Juventus owner Andrea Agnelli, Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and AC Milan chief executive Ivan Gazidis would all have had a significant input into the Champions League discussions on Friday.

However, those clubs are among those to have broken ranks, to the fury of Uefa, whose president Aleksander Ceferin wanted to stave off a Super League threat.

The Premier League said a European Super League would ""destroy"" the dream of fans that ""their team may climb to the top and play against the best"".

It added such a league would ""undermine the appeal of the whole game"" and that they would work with the FA, the English Football League, Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), League Managers Association (LMA) and fans to ""defend the integrity and future prospects of English football"".

Juventus and AC Milan have signed up to the breakaway league plans

The FA said it will ""not provide permission to any competition that would be damaging to English football"" and will ""take any legal and/or regulatory action necessary"" to stop it.

Bundesliga sides are opposed to the plans because the German model means commercial investors cannot have more than a 49% stake in clubs, so fans hold a majority of their own voting rights.

French Ligue 1 side Paris St-Germain are not part of the group either.

Uefa said it thanked ""those clubs in other countries, especially the French and German clubs, who have refused to sign up"" to the breakaway league.

""We call on all lovers of football, supporters and politicians, to join us in fighting against such a project if it were to be announced,"" it added.

""This persistent self-interest of a few has been going on for too long. Enough is enough.""

Quite when the European Super League would start is unclear.

However, world governing body Fifa has already said it would not recognise such a competition and any players involved in it would be denied the chance to play at a World Cup.

Serie A has called an emergency board meeting to discuss the matter.

The Football Supporters' Association said it is ""totally opposed"" to the plans, which it said were ""motivated by nothing but cynical greed"".

It added: ""This competition is being created behind our backs by billionaire club owners who have zero regard for the game's traditions and continue to treat football as their personal fiefdom.""

The PFA said it had ""substantial concerns"" about the proposal, adding it would ""detract from the strength and joy of domestic football and diminish the game for the vast majority of fans across the continent"".

France's President Emmanuel Macron said he ""welcomes the position of French clubs to refuse to participate"" in a European Super League ""that threatens the principle of solidarity and sporting merit"".

A statement from the French presidency added: ""The French state will support all the steps taken by the LFP [France's professional leagues governing body], FFF [France's football association], Uefa and Fifa to protect the integrity of federal competitions, whether national or European.""

It has been agreed the new-look Champions League will involve an initial phase where every club plays 10 matches each rather than the current group phase.

In addition there would be play-offs, followed by a knockout phase.

The most controversial aspect of the proposals surround the allocation of the four additional places, with two being reserved for the clubs ranked highest in Uefa's co-efficient table who fail to qualify for the Champions League through their domestic competition, but do secure some kind of European football.

At the moment, Liverpool and Chelsea would be the clubs who benefited from that system if it was in place this season.

'An absolute disgrace'

Former Manchester United captain Gary Neville said he is ""absolutely disgusted"" by the plans.

""I'm a Manchester United fan and have been for 40 years,"" Neville, who also co-owns League Two club Salford City, told Sky Sports. ""It's an absolute disgrace.

""Honestly, we have to wrestle back the power in this country from the clubs at the top of this league and that includes my club.""

The former England defender said the six English clubs involved should be docked points and fined.

""It's pure greed,"" Neville said. ""They're [the club's owners] imposters.

""They're nothing to do with football in this country. There's 100-odd years of history in this country of fans who have lived and loved these clubs.

""We're in the middle of a pandemic and an economic crisis. Football clubs in the [semi-professional] National League are going bust, furloughing players and these lot are having Zoom calls about breaking away.

""Dock them all points tomorrow. Put them at the bottom of the league and take the money off them. Seriously. You have to stamp on this.""",1319,8110,6,37
0,The Blood-Clot Problem Is Multiplying,https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/04/vaccine-related-blood-clot-mystery-must-be-solved/618623/,"Whether the blood issues are ultimately linked to only one vaccine, or two vaccines, or more, it’s absolutely crucial to remember the unrelenting death toll from the coronavirus itself—and the fact that COVID-19 can set off its own chaos in the circulatory system, with blood clots showing up in “almost every organ.” That effect of the disease is just one of many reasons the European Medicines Agency has emphasized that the “overall benefits of the [AstraZeneca] vaccine in preventing COVID-19 outweigh the risks of side effects.” The same is true of Johnson & Johnson’s. These vaccines are saving countless lives across multiple continents.

But it’s also crucial to determine the biological cause of any vaccine-related blood conditions. This global immunization project presents a lot of firsts: the first authorized use of mRNA vaccines like the ones from Pfizer and Moderna; the first worldwide use of adenovirus vectors for vaccines like AstraZeneca’s, Johnson & Johnson’s, and Sputnik V; and the first attempt to immunize against a coronavirus. Which, if any, of these new frontiers might be linked to serious side effects? Which, if any, of the other vaccines could be drawn into this story, too? How can a tiny but disturbing risk be mitigated as we fight our way out of this pandemic? And what might be the implications for vaccine design in the years to come?

To answer these questions, scientists will have to figure out the biology behind this rare blood condition: what exactly causes it; when and why it happens. This is not an easy task. While the evidence available so far is fairly limited, some useful theories have emerged. The notions listed below are not all in competition with one another: Some are overlapping—or even mutually reinforcing—in important ways. And their details matter quite a bit. A better understanding of the cause of this condition may allow us to predict its reach.

Theory 1: Platelet Problems

The leading theory behind the blood abnormalities associated with the AstraZeneca vaccine traces to a case from late February. A 49-year-old nurse in Austria who had received the vaccine developed clotting in her veins and arteries, along with a low platelet count. That’s an odd combination: Platelets are like the bricks of the clotting system, held together with a mortar of molecules called coagulation factors; when your body has a shortage of these bricks, it typically has a hard time building clots.

There are a couple of exceptions, though, as the science journalists Kai Kupferschmidt and Gretchen Vogel explained in March. In a condition called disseminated intravascular coagulation, so much clotting occurs that circulating platelets get used up. A rare reaction to a blood-thinning drug called heparin, which is safely prescribed to millions of people in the U.S. every year, can also produce the same signal. When that occurs, heparin attaches itself to a molecule called platelet factor 4, which is released by damaged platelets. The body mistakenly treats this complex as a pathogen before going on to attack the platelet cells directly, which sometimes leads to clots.",507,3131,5,37
0,Germany's Far Right Is Surging Again.,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/13/trial-of-12-men-accused-of-planning-far-right-terror-attacks-opens-in-stuttgart,"The trial of 12 men accused of planning a series of far-right terror attacks on asylum seekers, Muslims, Jews and politicians in an attempt to overthrow German democracy has opened in the city of Stuttgart.

Gruppe S (Group S) was named after Werner S, a 55-year-old junk salesman, who is believed to have established it in 2019 and been its leader. He has described himself as a “free spirit with leanings towards National Socialism”. The like-minded men he brought to the group sought to trigger a situation akin to a civil war, according to federal prosecutors.

Eleven of the men are on trial for membership of a terrorist organisation and violating weapons laws. The 12th stands accused of supporting a terrorist group.

The accused include a tiler, a nurse, security guards and an administration secretary with the police. Several of the men had links to or membership of other far-right groups including the organisation Bruderschaft Deutschland, considered to be a collecting point for rightwing extremists and counting hooligans, bouncers and martial artists among its members.

The prosecutors said the men, aged between 33 and 62, were German nationals who had an “openly Nazi attitude” to life, doing nothing to hide their anti-foreigner sentiment. Some have tattoos bearing Nazi symbols, including a swastika, an image of Hitler in uniform, the word “Aryan” and the Imperial war flag of the German empire.

In a chat group on the platform Telegram, one of the accused allegedly referred to black people as “subhuman, so up for a massacre”. The men used codenames when talking to one another on the telephone. They met for discussions and shooting practice with their ultimate aim being to establish a new societal order, according to the prosecution.

One man is said to have told his girlfriend he was prepared to “die in battle” for the organisation’s cause.

The men are also accused of arranging to purchase weapons and ammunition valued at about €50,000 (£43,000) via a dealer known to one of them. Other weapons were found during raids on the men’s homes and other properties.

One of the attacks they planned was against the co-leader of the Green party, Robert Habeck, prosecutors said.

Gruppe S’s members had connections to several rightwing extremist groupings, using the networks they built on to recruit new members, and calling on “fast, clever and brutal fighters” to join their cause.

Eight of the 12 men appeared in court hiding their faces behind case binders. They were seated behind bulletproof glass.

The group came to light after a man identified only as Paul U, an erstwhile member, became disillusioned with the group and blew its cover by informing the police. The police raided homes and properties linked to the group on 14 February last year, since when the men have been held in custody.

A bespectacled Paul U appeared in court dressed in a navy blue anorak, its hood and his medical face mask covering almost his entire face. He has been denounced by the group’s members as a traitor, and has police protection.

Paul U told the judge he could not give his address for reasons of his safety. He has told investigators the group was founded at a barbecue area on the edge of a remote forest near the town of Altdorf in Baden-Württemberg.

The trial is taking place against a backdrop of growing concern about the rise of violent rightwing crime in Germany, with the number of extremist incidents rising to a four-year high last year, according to police statistics released in February.

High-profile rightwing extremist attacks have rocked the country in recent years, leading the interior minister, Horst Seehofer, to call far-right terrorism “the biggest security threat” facing the country.

In January Stephan Ernst, a neo-Nazi, was sentenced to life in prison for murdering the Christian Democratic Union politician Walter Lübcke due to his support of pro-migration policies.

In February last year, a far-right extremist operating alone gunned down 10 people and wounding five others in the central city of Hanau.

In 2019 two people were killed after a neo-Nazi attacker tried to burst into a synagogue in Halle on the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur.

The current trial is taking place amid high security in Stammheim prison in the north of Stuttgart, where the men are being held. It is the same complex in which the Red Army Faction urban guerrilla terrorist group were held in the 1970s, as well as where their trials took place.

The trial is expected to continue until August.",754,4532,6,37
0,Why is Boris Johnson coming to India?,https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/news/boris-johnson-coming-india,"England sells asylum in the name of democratic legal processes to all sorts of money-laundering thugs whom we seek. Our bilateral political relations have been on a roller coaster for several years. The British government tolerates (possibly even encourages) anti-India sentiments among the Indo-Pakistani diaspora, as a means of pressuring us.

New Delhi: If he does come, then why is Boris Johnson coming to India, his first major international visit after running away from Europe? The number of European leaders making a beeline for India despite the virus reminds one of the rush to Beijing in times gone by.

The citizens of Great Britain, as it used to be called (note the Great) were the world’s greatest empire builders, with almost one quarter of the planet under Britain’s sway at one time. We, Indians, were the world’s greatest empire busters, as we began the process of decolonization that saw the empire collapse. Deep down, many ex-colonials never forgave India for inaugurating the dismantling of the British empire, foremost among them the fellow named after a church on a hilltop, “an unashamed imperialist at a time when imperialism is on its last legs”, as Sardar Patel described him.

Britain, reeling today under its self-goal of quitting the European Union, is desperately seeking an enhanced independent international profile and has still not accepted its dramatically reduced role in global affairs. Fantasy has no cure. Boris Johnson famously said about Africa: “Africa’s problem is not that we were once in charge, but that we are no longer in charge.” As long as it retains a permanent seat in the United Nations, it will continue to fantasize that it is a great power. If UK were not a member of the UNSC, its global influence would be about the same as Somalia’s.

We may expect more nonsense such as the recent discussion on Kashmir or the Citizenship Amendment Act or the farmers’ agitation in the House of Commons and possibly the House of Frauds, sorry Lords.

Times change quickly, mindsets more sluggishly. As the legendary Bob Dylan sang in his 1960s classic:

Your old road is rapidly agin’

Please get out of the new one

If you can’t lend your hand

For the times they are a-changin’

Britain refuses to accept the new road.

In 1947-48, we were attacked by tribal lashkars and soldiers from Britain’s illegitimate child Pakistan led by British officers. In November 1947, under the command of a renegade called Major W.A. Brown who had sworn loyalty to the Maharaja of Kashmir, the Gilgit Scouts overthrew the Maharaja’s Governor in Gilgit, and declared accession to Pakistan. Instead of being court-martialed, he was knighted by the Queen.

By 1956, our foreign exchange reserves held in pound sterling in the Bank of England, had been decimated by the sterling’s devaluation as Britain was in severe financial distress, and we had to pay pensions and make lumpsum recompense to retired British army officers. I recall that in 1965, when we were under pressure on the Kashmir front, we crossed the Punjab border and moved swiftly to Lahore, giving a rude shock to Pakistan, Britain denounced this “naked aggression” against Pakistan, and made similar noises in 1971. In 1991, our Foreign Exchange reserves were just enough for a couple of weeks of imports. We asked our dear former rulers for USD 600 mn to finance some essential imports and were told that we would need to pledge our gold to the Bank of England, which we did.

Till a few years ago, I used to see advertisements in Indian magazines about properties in England. Their property market was sustained by shady fellows from Pakistan, India, Russia, Africa, etc. A former Pakistani Prime Minister is still trying to explain how he was able to afford luxurious properties in London on his salary. So are several Indian businessmen.

England sells asylum in the name of democratic legal processes to all sorts of money-laundering thugs and hoodlums (involved in cricket, airlines and diamonds) whom we seek. This is ironic, considering that Britain pretended to be very active in forming the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in July 1989 at the Group of Seven (G-7) Summit in Paris. Our bilateral political relations have been on a roller coaster for several years. The British government tolerates (possibly even encourages) anti-India sentiments among the Indo-Pakistani diaspora, as a means of pressuring us. Britannia no longer rules the waves, but the waves of atavism rule Britannia.

In one of my postings overseas, my British counterpart complained that his principals were badgering him to get involved in peace negotiations with a rebel group, and to tag along with the US ambassador, so that London could claim some influence in its former colony.

Quitting the European Union will further erode the UK’s global relevance, if it has any left. But it will continue to delude itself that it still determines the destinies of hundreds of millions, as it did for two hundred years. Interestingly, while young India is bursting with energy and enthusiasm, Britain has a Minister for Loneliness.

Any former colony and the former colonial master need three generations to overcome the “colonized” mindset. The first is the transitional generation educated and trained by the masters, so there is an element of nostalgia (while the departing overlords fret over their lost glory). The second generation recalls the exploitation but is largely indifferent, and the third wonders what the “special relationship” is all about.

Those who rule England today had fathers or grandfathers or uncles in the British Indian Civil Service or the military. They have been brought up on stories of the white man’s burden and their glorious lives in British India with huge homes and dozens of servants for “chota hazri” and “bada hazri”

So, Shri Boris Johnson will look for:

The huge Indian market for British products including defence equipment, and Indian vaccines for his country. Indian investment in England. Indian students to save floundering British universities.

In 2021, England needs India more than India ever needed England.

England’s strategy paper released in March 2021, depicts Russia as an active enemy and China as a systemic foe. It promises to send its pitiable navy to the Indian Ocean and to spend money to increase its nuclear arsenal.

In the 1790s, Bertrand Barere, a French revolutionary had called England a “nation of shopkeepers”. Napoleon is supposed to have said to the British: “All your great riches…arose from commerce…It is not…mines of gold, silver, or diamonds…your shops and your trade have made you what you are.” The business of the UK is business. When we bought their fighter jets, everything was hunky dory, but not when we bought something else. India is a major investor in the UK. In recent years there is more Indian money invested in UK than the other way around. According to official estimates, as of 2020, Indian companies in the UK have a turnover of some 50 bn pounds, and employ several hundred thousand people. Tata group alone employs almost 65,000 people in the UK. All hell broke loose in 2011 when Ratan Tata reportedly complained in a newspaper interview that British workers at Jaguar Land Rover and Corus (companies that he had acquired) could not be found in their office after 3.30 pm on Fridays. For good measure he reportedly added that in India workers stayed in the office until midnight if necessary.

India’s Finance Minister’s description in Parliament in 2010 of British aid to India as peanuts, sparked furious media and political debate in England on why the aid was being continued when India preferred the French fighter jet Rafale to the Typhoon, which is partly manufactured in Britain. With considerable difficulty, India managed to persuade the British government to discontinue its assistance from 2015, much to the horror of some Indian NGOs (and their UK Department of Foreign and International Development bosses).

This kind of phenomenon, where non-Western countries impact the West, has been called “reverse colonialism”, and maverick Boris Johnson remarked at a dinner in 2017 (when he was Foreign Secretary) that: “We in the UK are the beneficiaries of reverse colonialism.” He pointed out that Jaguar cars made in UK and exported back to India “in ever growing numbers” incarnated the “commercial role reversal” between India and the UK.

In 2013, then Prime Minister David Cameron led the largest trade delegation with more than 100 representatives from multinational corporations, medium-to-small-sized corporations, and universities to India. Net result zero! A cartoon in the Economist in 2013 after David Cameron’s visit depicted him genuflecting before our then Prime Minister and chairperson of UPA and asking for Indian investment in UK.

Former British PM Theresa May came in 2016 to discuss post-Brexit relations with India, her first bilateral visit to a non-European country since becoming Prime Minister. Explaining the decision, May said: “It [the visit] matters now more than ever. India is the fastest-growing major economy.” Her business delegation signed several MoUs. Nothing happened.

While the two sides have discussed a bilateral free trade agreement, it has not yet been worked on.

In the early years of Independence, thousands of Indians studied in England. Oxford and Cambridge degrees were much coveted, but then were overtaken by US universities. Ten years ago, there was much hype over the UK India Education and Research Initiative (UKIERI). Prime Minister David Cameron said that a higher quality of education would lead to providing opportunities for all, thus encouraging economic growth, and overcoming poverty for India (you see they still think they can alleviate the poverty that they caused in India!). However, the number of Indian students in the UK did not increase owing to tighter rules for international students.

From the 1950s to the 1970s, hundreds of thousands of Indians (especially from Punjab) and others from former British colonies went to the UK in search of economic advancement. They worked hard, with total dedication and determination. “Over-taim” helped them earn much more than their salaries. Today the Indian diaspora in UK is around 2 million and many of them have achieved eminent positions. Over the last 20 years, the number has been reduced to a trickle, thanks to labyrinthine British immigration laws that assume that half the world sees the UK as paradise and is dying to get there.

While researching a project, I came across this gem. At a meeting with his officials in 1946 in Lahore, the egregious and pompous Sir James Glancy ICS (1906 Punjab cadre), governor of Punjab, said: “We would leave very soon but remember that you would not be able to maintain those vaulting standards of fairness, honesty, efficaciousness and diligence in administration, which we maintained…despite difficulties of governing and numerous odds faced by us. Time would come when many of you would remember us with tears in your eyes.” Please, readers, do cry for the glorious years of the British Raj.

And yes, as a gift to India, we will be promised that Nirav Modi will soon be back in India, so Shri Johnson does not have to answer embarrassing questions.

It flowed with energy, erupted with opponents and overwhelmed them with 28 unanswered runs in seven video games.

On Sunday, nonetheless, River stabilized a dam and an A, scoring only one run on two hits within the first seven innings of play in opposition to the Detroit Tigers.

It was not till the underside of the eighth inning that Oakland returned to its circulate. Catcher Sean Murphy led the innings with a solo house run, holding the sport within the middle in two matches.

After Murphy’s rating the offense began raging once more. The A’s runners on the corners have been neither working nor scored within the eighth inning, it appeared to set the desk for extra aggressive manufacturing within the backside of the ninth when first baseman Matt Olson hit a one-out double for middle. Killed, Murphys walked and designated hitter Mitch Morland hit a ball laborious sufficient to make a fielding error by Detroit’s third baseman that allowed Olson to attain a objective. The win prolonged the A’s profitable rhythm to eight video games, enhancing them to 9-7 on the season.

In opposition to Detroit leftie starter Matthew Boyd, the A’s scored simply two hits and raced previous the underside of the eighth inning once they tied the sport on Murphy’s homer.

After Boyd was out, the A’s have been the superior runners within the nook with solely proper fielder Mark Kanha and middle fielder Ramon Loriano for a strike.

0,'Big six' agree to join 'Super League',https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/56795811,"Last updated on .From the section European Football

Liverpool and Manchester United are the two most successful sides in English football history

Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham are among 12 clubs who have agreed to join a new European Super League (ESL).

In a seismic move for European football, the Premier League clubs will join AC Milan, Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Inter Milan, Juventus and Real Madrid.

The ESL said the founding clubs had agreed to establish a ""new midweek competition"" with teams continuing to ""compete in their respective national leagues"".

It says the inaugural season ""is intended to commence as soon as practicable"" and ""anticipated that a further three clubs will join"" the breakaway.

The ESL says it also plans to launch a women's competition as soon as possible after the men's tournament starts.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Uefa and the Premier League condemned the move to launch a European Super League when news of it broke on Sunday.

World governing body Fifa has previously said it would not recognise such a competition and any players involved in it could be denied the chance to play at a World Cup.

Uefa, Europe's governing body, reiterated this warning on Sunday when it said players involved would be banned from all other competitions at domestic, European or world level and could be prevented from representing their national teams.

After the Super League was announced, Fifa expressed its ""disapproval"" of the proposed competition and called on ""all parties involved in heated discussions to engage in calm, constructive and balanced dialogue for the good of the game"".

In a statement, the ESL said: ""Going forward, the founding clubs look forward to holding discussions with Uefa and Fifa to work together in partnership to deliver the best outcomes for the new league and for football as a whole.""

Dion Dublin & Danny Murphy discuss the plans for a European Super League

Why now?

There were talks in October, involving Wall Street bank JP Morgan, over a new £4.6bn competition that would replace the Champions League.

Uefa had hoped the plans for a new 36-team Champions League - with reforms set to be confirmed on Monday - would head off the formation of a Super League.

However, the 12 sides involved in the Super League do not think the reforms go far enough.

They said the global pandemic has ""accelerated the instability in the existing European football economic model"".

""In recent months, extensive dialogue has taken place with football stakeholders regarding the future format of European competitions,"" they added.

""The founding clubs believe the solutions proposed following these talks do not solve fundamental issues, including the need to provide higher-quality matches and additional financial resources for the overall football pyramid.""

What is the proposed format?

The league will have 20 teams - the 12 founding members plus the three unnamed clubs they expect to join soon and five sides who qualify annually according to their domestic achievements.

Under the proposals, the ESL campaign would start in August each year, with midweek fixtures, and the clubs would be split into two groups of 10, playing each other home and away.

The top three in each group would qualify for the quarter-finals, with the teams in fourth and fifth playing a two-legged play-off for the two remaining spots.

From then on, it would have the same two-leg knockout format used in the Champions League before a single-leg final in May at a neutral venue.

The ESL says it will generate more money than the Champions League and would result in a greater distribution of revenue throughout the game.

What do the Super League leaders say?

Juventus and AC Milan have signed up to the breakaway league plans

Real Madrid president Florentino Perez is the first chairman of the ESL and says ""we will help football at every level"".

""Football is the only global sport in the world with more than four billion fans and our responsibility as big clubs is to respond to their desires,"" he added.

Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli has resigned from the Uefa executive committee and as chairman of the European Club Association (ECA), which had pushed the planned Champions League reforms.

He said the 12 clubs had ""come together at this critical moment, enabling European competition to be transformed, putting the game we love on a sustainable footing for the long-term future"".

Manchester United co-chairman Joel Glazer will be a vice-chairman of the Super League.

He said: ""By bringing together the world's greatest clubs and players to play each other throughout the season, the Super League will open a new chapter for European football, ensuring world-class competition and facilities, and increased financial support for the wider football pyramid.""

What has been the reaction?

Essentially, widespread condemnation from anyone not involved in the proposed league.

Johnson said the plans will be ""very damaging for football"" and France's President Emmanuel Macron welcomed French clubs refusing to join.

Uefa released a joint statement with England's Football Association, the Premier League, the Spanish Football Federation, La Liga and the Italian Football Federation, as well as Serie A, saying they will ""remain united"" in trying to stop the breakaway, using ""all available measures"".

The ECA ""strongly opposed"" the league, while the Football Supporters' Association said the plans were ""motivated by nothing but cynical greed"".

Among ex-professionals, former Liverpool and Tottenham midfielder Danny Murphy told BBC Sport the plans ""sound soulless"", former Manchester United captain Gary Neville told Sky Sports he was ""absolutely disgusted"", while former team-mate Rio Ferdinand said on BT Sport that the proposals will hurt fans the most.

'The ultimate betrayal'

Fan groups associated with all six English clubs are strongly opposed to the Super League.

Liverpool supporters' group Spirit of Shankly (SOS) said they were ""appalled"" by the decision of Fenway Sports Group, the club's US-based owner.

In a social media post, SOS said: ""FSG have ignored fans in their relentless and greedy pursuit of money. Football is ours, not theirs. Our football club is ours not theirs.""

Chelsea Supporters' Trust called the move ""unforgivable"" and said their members and ""football supporters across the world have experienced the ultimate betrayal"".

The Arsenal Supporters' Trust called their club's agreement to join ""the death of Arsenal as a sporting institution"".

Manchester City FC Official Supporters Club said the move showed ""those involved have zero regard for the game's traditions"" and they were ""determined to fight against this proposed Super League"".

The Manchester United Supporters Trust had earlier said the proposals were ""completely unacceptable"" and the ESL ""goes against everything football, and Manchester United, should stand for"".

Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust said the ESL was a ""concept driven by avarice and self-interest at the expense of the intrinsic values of the game we hold so dear"".

Analysis

BBC Sport's Simon Stone

If there was any lingering doubt over the desire of these 12 clubs to launch their own competition, it has been removed by their statement - reinforced by each of them through their own media platforms.

So many questions remain unanswered.

Chiefly, can they actually get their plan over the line given the strong resistance from Uefa and the leagues and associations of the countries concerned?

But beyond that, who will the other three clubs be to make up the 15 founding members? Will Bayern Munich and Paris St Germain eventually join up? And how will the other five clubs be decided?

These discussions will be fascinating. But right now, the clubs who have signed up to the European Super League have a public relations battle to turn around perceptions - because initial reaction has been overwhelmingly negative.",1275,8015,7,38
0,Why is this not making more headlines?,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-united-states-standoff-fears/,"Moscow — Russia warned the United States on Tuesday against sending warships to the Black Sea, urging American forces to stay away from the annexed Crimean peninsula ""for their own good"" as the situation along Ukraine's border caused increasing concern in the West. The U.S. Secretary of State, meeting with Ukrainian and NATO officials in Brussels, made it clear that the Biden administration, along with its allies in Europe, has Ukraine's back and considers Russia's ongoing military buildup in the region ""very provocative.""

The Turkish Foreign Ministry said on Friday that Washington had informed Ankara that two U.S. warships would pass through Turkish waters this week to be deployed in the Black Sea. The deployment would come amid a significant escalation of the conflict in eastern Ukraine between Russian-backed separatists and Ukraine's forces, which have U.S. and European support.

Hostilities first flared in 2014 when Russia unilaterally annexed Crimea — a peninsula that sticks out into the Black Sea and is home to a Russian navy base — away from Ukraine, drawing condemnation from the Western world and a series of sanctions.

Russian Deputy Foreign Ministry Sergei Ryabkov was cited by Russian news agencies on Tuesday as calling the deployment of U.S. warships in the Black Sea a provocation designed to test Russia's nerves.

""There is absolutely nothing for American ships to be doing near our shores,"" Ryabkov said, warning there was a very high risk of unspecified incidents if U.S. military hardware were to be positioned in the Black Sea.

""We warn the United States that it will be better for them to stay far away from Crimea and our Black Sea coast,"" Ryabkov was quoted as saying. ""It will be for their own good.""

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby declined during a regular press briefing on Friday to confirm the Turkish government's statement that U.S. warships were being sent to the Black Sea. He noted that the U.S. ""routinely"" operates in the Black Sea, but said he wouldn't ""speak to operations.""

The current escalation has added strain to already tense U.S.-Russian relations. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Russia against aggressive actions in an interview aired over the weekend, saying any aggression in Ukraine would have consequences.

Ryabkov responded on Tuesday, accusing the Russian ""adversary"" of trying to undermine Russia's position on the international stage. He reiterated Russia's readiness to defend the interests of its citizens, and ethnic Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was preparing itself in the event any new sanctions should be imposed on Moscow by the U.S. or its global partners.

Meanwhile, Russia has continued to move forces into both Crimea and the region along its border with Ukraine. The Defense Ministry reported on Tuesday that 15 warships and vessels of the Caspian Flotilla had been sent to the Black Sea as part of previously announced military exercises.

Ukraine said earlier this week that Russia had already massed more than 40,000 troops along its border, and at least 40,000 more in Crimea. Russia says the troop buildup is part of exercises, and has stressed that its forces will go where they want, when they want on Russian territory.

""Very provocative action""

Top U.S. officials are in Europe this week, including Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Blinken. Austin announced during a stop in Germany on Tuesday that the U.S. was going to deploy an additional 500 troops to that country.

When asked if the move was meant as a message to Russia, he said it was ""a sign to NATO"" of the U.S. commitment to the transatlantic alliance, and of the firm commitment to Germany. Under President Donald Trump, Washington said it would withdraw thousands of the American forces who've been stationed in Germany for decades. That decision was suspended by the Biden administration, and now the force is set to grow.

Blinken, meanwhile, was in Brussels, meeting NATO partners, and he met separately with his Ukrainian counterpart to discuss the standoff with Russia.

""The United States stands firmly behind the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and I'm her to reaffirm that with the foreign minister today,"" Blinken said. ""That's particularly important in a time when we're seeing, unfortunately, Russia take very provocative action when it comes to Ukraine. We're now seeing the largest concentration of Russian forces on Ukraine's border since 2014. That is a big concern not only to Ukraine, but to the United States and indeed to many of our allies and partners.""

Sitting across from him, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the Russian buildup was ""taking place not only along the border of Ukraine, but along the border of the democratic world. For thousands of kilometers to the north and to the east of our border with Russia, there is no democracy. So, this is the struggle that is taking place between democracies and authoritarianism, and in this struggle the support of the United States is absolutely crucial, and deeply appreciated.""

Kuleba thanked NATO, also, and said that warnings already conveyed to Moscow through diplomatic channels, ""will be supported by actions that make it very clear for Russia that the price of further aggression against Ukraine will be too heavy for it to bear.""

He said the Ukrainian and U.S. delegations in Brussels, and more broadly the NATO allies at large, would continue discussing ways to ensure stability along his country's tense border with Russia.

While no NATO deployments have been confirmed, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed the alliance was planning to position 40,000 more troops and 15,000 pieces of military equipment close to Russian territory. He didn't elaborate, but said that ""in response to the military activity of the alliance that threatens Russia, we have taken appropriate measures.""

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said earlier on Tuesday that he was ""seriously concerned"" by Russia's deployment of additional forces to the Ukrainian border.

""Russia is now trying to reestablish some kind of sphere of influence where they try to decide what neighbors can do,"" Stoltenberg said.

0,Lava Jato Hacker Walter Delgatti speaks,https://www.brasilwire.com/lava-jato-hacker-walter-delgatti-speaks/,"Facing a 300 year prison sentence, the man who hacked into chats between Judge Sergio Moro and the Curitiba Lava Jato task-force explains why he did it and why he is disappointed with the Intercept.

By Brian Mier

Walter Delgatti, 31, grew up in a conservative region of Sao Paulo in the mid-sized city of Araraquara. In a recent interview on the Brazilian news portal Brasil 247, he told the story of his life and explained why he decided to hack into the the conversations between members of the Lava Jato task force which have recently been admitted by the Supreme Court as evidence in the US-backed investigation that removed Lula from the 2018 presidential elections at a moment when he was leading in the polls with over double the support of neofacist former Military Dictatorship captain Jair Bolsonaro.

Delgatti developed an early interest in computer games age and got a job working in a LAN house at age 12. As a teenager he started hanging out with a group of friends who got involved in producing parties and concerts, mainly for EDM and Sertanejo, the Brazilian country pop music that is popular with conservatives. Although Sergio Moro and his allies in the Federal Police tried to portray Delgatti as a fanatical Bolsonaro supporter when he was first arrested, he says that although he initially supported the Lava Jato operation because he believed everything he saw in the media at the time, he was always apolitical. To this day, he said, he has never voted in an election.

As his friends music production operations grew, local police began to suspect that they were laundering money based on cash from informal transactions like entry fees to private parties with live music that was circulating through their bank accounts. In 2015, they raided Delgatti’s house and arrested him for allegedly having a fake credit card, but the charges didn’t stick. In 2017 they raided the houses of he and two other members of the production company. Delgatti was imprisoned for possession of illegal narcotics with intent to sell and his photo was posted all over the local news. In the interview for Brasil 247, he said he was framed. The illegal “narcotics” that police found in his house comprised of 3 boxes of the tranquilizer Clonazepam for which he had a prescription, along with anti-depressants, due to anxiety problems he’s had since childhood. In order to make it look like he was dealing the drug, which costs around $3.50 US a box in Brazil, the local media and police announced that he had been arrested with “86” pills – this due to the fact that he had already opened one box of 30 because was taking it nightly for anxiety and insomnia.

At this point, he spent 6 months in jail before being released on a habeas corpus, and his girlfriend dumped him. Delgatti says that she refused to believe his side of the story because there was so much positive news about Lava Jato in the media. On the day she dumped him she told him, “the public prosecutors never lie.”

Shortly afterwards, he was sitting in his court hearing and noticed one of the prosecutors chatting on Telegram. Looking over his shoulder, he managed to ascertain the man’s phone number. At this point, he decided to try to hack into the the prosecutors backup files on the cloud and see what he was saying about his case.

Delgatti does not go into much detail about how he did it, but he said that once you get into one person’s backup archives you can daisy chain through their address book and hack into all of their contacts messages as well. Soon, Delgatti had worked his way through hundreds of accounts, including two Supreme Court justices. After getting into the account of conservative journalist turned Congresswoman, Joice Hassleman, he saw Lava Jato chief prosecutor Delton Dallagnol’s name in her address book and hacked in. From there, he managed to get into the messages from the rest of the Curitiba Lava Jato task-force.

Delgatti says that most of the Lava Jato prosecutors would erase their messages every month or so, so he only had recent conversations from them. Dallagnol, on the other hand, still had 5 years of messages on his phone. Every conversation that he had ever had related to Lava Jato was still in his backup files on the web.

Slicing through the cloud like a hot knife through butter, soon Delgatti had 6 terabytes of conversations between Lava Jato task-force members. In the case of Judge Sergio Moro (who was bizarrely allowed to oversee the Lava Jato investigation, ruling on admissibility of evidence and issuing search warrants and then rule on his own investigation) Delgatti says that he erased his messages every week. However, as he was the real person running the investigation, continually illegally giving out instructions to the prosecutors in a case that he was supposed to rule impartially on, Dallagnol and the rest of the group shared his audio and text messages among themselves. This this is how Delgatti was able to accumulate hundreds of gigabytes of conversations involving Moro.

Delgatti says that at the time he still believed everything he saw on TV about Lava Jato. As he read through the messages, he panicked. “I saw that they were doing the same thing to Lula that they had done to me,” he said.

It was so much information that he only managed to read about 20% of it. This was enough for him to realize that a former President had been the victim of a huge injustice and that Bolsonaro’s election was illegitimate. Terrified that the Federal Police would find him and arrest him at any moment, he decided to figure out a way to go public with the information.

“I got in touch with several important journalists and nobody wanted to have anything to do with it,” he said. “I decided they were all afraid and that maybe I could convince someone who was living outside of Brazil to get involved.” He immediately thought of Jean Wyllys, Brazil’s first openly gay Congressman, who had resigned and fled Brazil with help from Brown University Professor James Green after receiving a series of death threats from Rio de Janeiro paramilitary militias connected to the Bolsonaro family.

Slicing through address book after address book, he managed to hack into the account of Rio Grande do Sul State Congresswoman and 2018 communist party Vice Presidential candidate Manuela d’Ávila, who is a friend of Wyllys. Posing as d’Ávila, he sent a series of messages to Wyllys, but was ignored. At this point, d’Ávila noticed she was being hacked and started talking to Delgatti. He explained what was going on, and she suggested intermediating with Glenn Greenwald for him.

Communist Porto Alegre State Congresswoman Manuela d’Ávila, a former journalist, played a key role introducing the hacker to Glenn Greenwald.

Greenwald asked to look at a selection of the leaks and Delgatti forwarded him a 57 gigabyte selection of the conversations. At this point, the Intercept, in partnership with a group of conservative media outlets like Veja and Folha de Sao Paulo that supported the 2016 coup against Dilma Rousseff, began publishing a series of articles based on the leaks. The Intercept articles revealed important information that clearly demonstrates illegal collusion between the judge and prosecutors. They show how Judge Sergio Moro gave instructions to the prosecution about what information should be leaked to what reporters in what TV networks and newspapers, in order to damage Lula’s public image during the lead up to the trial. The articles show prosecutors talking about praying to God that Bolsonaro win the presidential elections. They show that, even on the day of the final trial, they knew they had no evidence against Lula but that Moro was going to “take care of it” for them. They show prosecutors bragging about allies in the Supreme Court who would help open an exception to the Constitution and jail former President Lula for charges of “undetermined acts of corruption”, with no material evidence, 5 months before the presidential elections for which he was the leading candidate. The leaks were published slowly and selectively starting in June, 2019. Intercept refused to share its entire body of leaks with the public. It wouldn’t be until the 96th article in March 2020, after Lula had already been released from jail and the Covid Pandemic was taking up all of the headlines in the Brazilian media, that Intercept would release the first conversations about US involvement in Lava Jato, later helping smaller media outlet Agencia Publica reveal that a group of 18 FBI agents led by Leslie Backshies met with Lava Jato prosecutors every two weeks for several years, including during the period they were making their case against Lula.

Delgatti said that he now has mixed feelings about Greenwald and the Intercept. “I only sent the Intercept 57 gigabytes of the conversations from Lava Jato and after this, Glenn refused to take any more of it. He said, ‘no. What I already have is already going to give us enough material for 1 year of articles. It’s a lot of stuff. I have a year’s worth of articles,’ and he didn’t want any more of it. I had a lot more information and he didn’t want it. Now, he has released very little of what he received. To this day I don’t understand why. I haven’t spoken to him about it. I don’t know if, after the Attorney Generals office filed those charges against him that were later dropped, he might have felt pressured to pause things a little bit. I don’t know because I haven’t had any contact with him, but I see that he has released very little so far. I like the way he has contextualized the things he has published and I thank him for this, but I see that he has really just been publishing these leaks drop by drop and he hasn’t shared everything he’s received. I don’t know the motive for this. The fact is I sent him so much and he hasn’t ended up sharing it. The truth is, I feel a little disappointed and don’t understand why he did this.”

The maximum prison sentence in Brazil for hacking into a smartphone is 1 year, but through a loophole in the law, the Attorney General’s Office is threatening Delgatti with 300 consecutive prison sentences of one year each. When asked how he feels about it, he says that if he could do everything over again he would. “Even if I have to spend the rest of my life behind bars, it will be worth it to me because I know I have contributed something positive for democracy in this country. I believe strongly in this, this is why I didn’t charge the Intercept for the information.”

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has turned over 30 times more information than what was received by the Intercept – 20% of the total volume of leaks – to Lula’s defense team, and more and more evidence beneficial to the defense is coming out daily, much involving illegal collaboration with US Government officials beyond the terms of the partnership agreement. This has already resulted in a motion to drop charges due to violation of Brazil’s sovereignty laws. A recent leak revealed by the defense team shows Lava Jato chief Delton Dallagnol, on the day of Lula’s imprisonment, referring to it as a gift from the CIA. Now that Intercept has lost its monopoly over the Lava Jato leaks, time will tell whether it deliberately sat on evidence beneficial to the defense team of a former President during his unjust political imprisonment in what was recently referred to in a New York Times op ed piece as, the biggest legal scandal in Brazilian history.

Rome celebrates its 2,774th birthday on 21 April 2021. Known as Natale di Roma, the annual birthday celebration is based on the legendary founding of Rome by Romulus in 753 BC.

Traditionally the celebrations include historical re-enactments such as costumed parades and gladiator fights however in 2021, for the second year in a row, events will be moved online due to Italy's covid-19 restrictions.

Events are usually centred in the Circus Maximus and include gladiator fights and the trench-digging ritual, known as the tracciato del solco, which recalls the founding of ancient Roman towns when a trench or mundus was dug and offerings thrown into it to encourage the gods to watch over the inhabitants.

Other re-enactments include the agricultural Palilia ceremony. Dating back to before the founding of Rome, the ceremony was held in honour of the goddess Pales, protector of flocks and herds, and involved vestal virgins distributing straw and the ashes and blood of sacrificed animals before jumping over a bonfire three times.

The highlight of the Natale di Roma festivites, the grand parade, usually includes more than 1,500 costumed participants processing to and from the Circus Maximus, via the Colosseum.

The pageant is organised by the Gruppo Storico Romano, an historical dramatic society which, for more than 20 years, has brought history to life by re-enacting battles, historic events, and displays of ancient theatre and dance in the city centre.

Under the slogan ""We won't give up,"" this year the group's re-enactments will be streamed on Sunday 18 April from Italy's National Etruscan Museum at Villa Giulia.

The online programme of events, dedicated to Emperor Nero, will begin at 14.00 and conclude with gladiator fights live from Villa Giulia.

The historical re-enactments can be watched via the Gruppo Storico Romano Facebook page.

Last year the city of Rome also organised some online events to mark Natale di Roma. We will update this article accordingly if and when there is news on that front.",350,2186,6,40

Albert Arie was one of an estimated five Jews left in Egypt, according to Jimena, a website dedicated to the history of Egyptian Jews.

He was one of a group of anti-Zionist Jews who joined the Egyptian nationalist movement and was “celebrated by Egyptians for his refusal to move to Israel,” according to the Jewish blog, Elder Of Ziyon.

During the period in which the Egyptian Jewish community was persecuted and most left the country, which took place in stages according to Arie, first in 1948, then in 1956, followed by 1961 and 1967, Arie stayed behind. He described his life in an October interview he gave to Alarabiya News as part of a documentary on the lives of Egypt’s Jews.

He told the news outlet that when he was a young man, the Jewish community considered Egypt their country and couldn’t imagine a situation that would cause them to leave.

“In the Jewish sect, in 1945, no one could imagine that in 1948 there would be a war and Jews would emigrate,” he said. “It was impossible to think even after what the Muslim Brotherhood did, no one thought they would leave the country.”

Arie is the grandfather of Magda Haroun, the current president of the Egyptian Jewish community. According to Haroun, the community no longer has enough men for a minyan.

“Our numbers are few and one day our presence will no longer exist in Egypt,” she said in the documentary. “But we have to keep and maintain (the synagogues).”",273,1529,10,40

They have both been told what they can and can’t wear by the people around them, based on their religion.

In Indonesia, many politicians argue that the jilbab, a kind of hijab, is mandatory in Islam and that Muslim girls should be forced to wear it from a young age. A new decree allows for students or teachers to now wear whatever they want in school, but not every place enforces this; Nadya grew up having to wear it at school, and was expected to continue doing so afterwards by her family.

In France, the opposite conversation is happening, with a new bill that is stopping minors from wearing conspicuous religious clothing at school, and the hijab receiving widespread media attention in a country where secularism is celebrated. Growing up, Emna felt that lots of people in French society had misconceptions around the hijab as a result.

0,Valencia University: Europe's Most Wanted,https://valencian.es/valencia-university/,"Spain is the number one country for Erasmus exchange students, and Valencia University is Europe’s most desired university…

Valencia has become a favourite among European students participating in the Erasmus exchange programme, according to European Commission data. The University hosted 2,401 foreign students in the 2019-2020 academic year, ranking first in Europe. Not only that, but the Polytechnic of Valencia, Valencia’s second university, was the fourth most visited university in the whole of Europe.

Valencia has clearly become a popular destination for international students.

So why do students choose Valencia?

Clearly, it is not just to learn. Valencia University does not even rank among the top 400 universities in the world, and the Polytechnic of Valencia barely ranks among the top 300. It is safe to say that the majority of European students come to our city for the unique way of life. The weather is pleasant all year, and the nightlife – outside of restrictions – is also appealing. When you factor in the low prices for not only the courses, but also for accommodation, transportation, and food, it’s easy to see why Valencia is so popular.

Since its inception in 1987, the Erasmus Exchange programme has become something of a miracle, moving around five million students each year across 4,000 universities and 31 countries.

The programme was designed to foster cultural, social, and academic exchanges among European students, as well as to serve as a unifying force in the old continent. And this concept was a complete success. The program’s total budget has grown from modest beginnings to €26bn in 2021, which is more than the total educational budget of many of its members.

Spain has become one of the most active countries in the programme, with the most students from all over Europe. Erasmus enabled 58,830 foreign students to spend a full semester in Spain in 2019. However, it is not a one-way street; Spaniards enjoy studying abroad as well, with 44,000 Spanish students travelling abroad in the same year.

The French parliament on Thursday adopted legislation that characterises sex with a child under the age of 15 as rape and punishable by up to 20 years in jail, bringing its penal code closer in line with many other Western nations.

Sex between an adult and a child younger than 15 was already illegal but could only be prosecuted as rape if there was proof the minor was coerced through violence, constraint or surprise. Without proof of coercion, it was prosecuted as the lesser offence of a 'sexual act on a minor'

""This is an historic law for our children and our society,"" Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti told the National Assembly.

""No adult aggressor will be able to claim the consent of a minor younger than 15-years-old.""

The vote in favour of the bill was unanimous at its final reading, the Assembly said on Twitter.

There had been concerns from some lawmakers that an age of consent below which sex automatically constituted rape might criminalise a consensual sexual relationship between a minor and a person only a few years older.

As a consequence, a ""Romeo and Juliet"" clause that allows for sexual relations between a minor and an individual up to five years older. The clause will not apply in cases of sexual assault.

The legislation also considers incestuous sex with a minor under 18 to be rape.

In a country that has long cherished its self-image as the land of seduction and romance, sexual abuse against women and children for years went undetected or undeclared in the upper echelons of power and within celebrity circles.

But there has been much soul-searching in recent years.

The #MeToo movement that swept around the world after numerous women in 2017 accused U.S. movie producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault proved a turning point in France. So too did the fall from grace in 2020 of a French writer who had written openly about his pedophilia.

France had already toughened its sex crimes laws in 2018 when it outlawed sexual harassment on the streets, leaving cat-callers and aggressively lecherous individuals facing potential on-the-spot fines.

0,Angry Berlin renters protest court ruling,https://www.dw.com/en/angry-berlin-renters-protest-court-ruling/a-57220959,"Several thousand people turned out in Germany's capital Berlin to demonstrate against the lifting of the city's rent cap on Thursday.

Germany's constitutional court in Karlsruhe earlier ruled that the Berlin state government had no right to impose the cap.

Coming into effect in February 2020, it saw rents for 90% of Berlin's apartments frozen for five years at their June 2019 level.

Renters are concerned that they now could be hit by sudden rent hikes.

Police estimated the crowd of protesters to have reached 'four figures'

Even the UN is 'quite concerned'

In an Interview with DW, Balakrishnan Rajagopal, UN's special rapporteur on the right to housing, warnend of the impact the court's decision could have.

""My main concern is that this particular ruling could affect the ability of the Berlin government, as well as the federal government, to ensure that housing remains affordable.""

He added, that there is ""general interest"" in ""the influence that Germany's record will have on other countries that are also facing similar crises of affordability in other large global cities like Berlin around the world, how it will affect their ability to control the problem of affordability.""

Protesters demand an end to 'rent madness'

Yesterday demonstrators first gathered at Hermannplatz in Neukoelln then marched to Kottbusser Tor in Kreuzberg, in the east of the city.

Many brought saucepan lids and drummed on them, a play on the German word ""Deckel"" (also the lid of a cooking pan or the cap of a bottle) used to describe the rent cap. Some shouted, ""If you take one lid from us, we'll come back with thousands.""

'We only want affordable apartments' this placard reads

Demonstrators demanded politicians clamp down on what they described as ""rent madness.""

Police put the number of participants in the rally organized by the Berlin Tenants' Association in the ""mid-four-digit range.""

Most protesters wore medical masks in compliance with coronavirus regulations.

Clashes with police

There were reports of scuffles between police and some protesters — part of a group of around 400 people who remained after the official end of the march.

Police reported isolated incidences of violence as they tried to disperse the protests

Some carried out isolated offenses against the police, a police spokesperson said.

The German newspaper Tagesspiegel reported that some protesters threw bottles and police made arrests.

Berlin's police said it would provide further information about events on Friday.

Israel and Greece have signed their biggest ever defence procurement deal, which Israel said on Sunday would strengthen political and economic ties between the countries and the two countries' air forces launched a joint exercise.

The agreement includes a $1.65 billion contract for the establishment and operation of a training centre for the Hellenic Air Force by Israeli defence contractor Elbit Systems (ESLT.TA) over a 22-year period, Israel's defence ministry said.

The training centre will be modelled on Israel's own flight academy and will be equipped with 10 M-346 training aircraft produced by Italy's Leonardo (LDOF.MI), the ministry said.

Elbit will supply kits to upgrade and operate Greece's T-6 aircraft and also provide training, simulators and logistical support.

""I am certain that (this programme) will upgrade the capabilities and strengthen the economies of Israel and Greece and thus the partnership between our two countries will deepen on the defence, economic and political levels,"" said Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz.

The announcement follows a meeting in Cyprus on Friday between the UAE, Greek, Cypriot and Israeli foreign ministers, who agreed to deepen cooperation. read more

The Israeli and Greek air forces on Sunday launched a joint exercise in Greece, the Israeli military said.

In at least one past exercise over Greece, Israeli fighter planes practised against an S-300 posted on Crete. The Russian-made air defence system is also deployed in Syria and Iran, Israel's foes.

A source in the Hellenic National Defence Command said the S-300 had not been activated in the joint exercise that began Sunday.

It came after four years in which President Donald J. Trump repeatedly cast doubt on intelligence findings that Russia was culpable for cyberattacks, poisonings and disinformation campaigns.

It was also the first time the United States government placed the blame for the “SolarWinds” hacking attack, which penetrated American government agencies and corporations, right at the feet of Mr. Putin, saying the operation was masterminded by the S.V.R., one of the Russian foreign intelligence agencies directly under his control. The same intelligence agency conducted the first of two major hackings into the Democratic National Committee six years ago.

In the final days of Mr. Trump’s term in office, an American intelligence assessment concluded simply that the intrusion was most “likely Russian in origin.”

In the weeks leading up to Thursday’s announcement, Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, acknowledged that sanctions alone would not be enough to deter the Russians. He said the response to Russia would include “seen and unseen” actions, and Mr. Biden himself suggested in December that the United States would respond in kind, presumably with cyberoperations of its own.

It may take weeks or months to detect those effects, and some may be visible only to the Russians — though that could undercut the message to other adversaries, including China, Iran and North Korea.

The most significant economic sanction the Biden administration imposed was to stop American financial firms from dealing in newly issued Russian debt, a restriction that goes into effect on June 14 to allow institutions to understand and prepare for the ban, and it is more of a warning shot than a sharp penalty.

A magnitude 5.9 earthquake has struck Iran’s southern province of Bushehr, where a nuclear power plant is located, but there were no immediate reports of considerable damage.

At least five people were injured, Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency reported. The epicentre of the earthquake on Sunday was the town of Rig.

Hospitals in nearby cities and provinces were put on alert with rescue teams and 50 ambulances sent to the area, a regional official told state TV.

Electricity and landline telephone and internet in the regional city of Gonaveh were cut off “and people are taking to the streets for fear of earthquakes”, semi-official news agency Tasnim reported.

An Iranian government official told Reuters news agency there were no reports of damage at the Bushehr nuclear complex, situated on Iran’s Gulf coast.

The earthquake was centred 100km (60 miles) away from the plant and was relatively shallow – only 10km (6 miles) deep, according to Iranian media which also reported nine aftershocks and posted pictures that showed collapsed mud-brick walls in some villages.

0,"UN: Hunger, Rape Rising in Ethiopia's Tigray",https://www.voanews.com/ethiopia-tigray/un-hunger-rape-rising-ethiopias-tigray,"The U.N. humanitarian chief warned Thursday that an already dire situation in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region is getting worse five months into the conflict, with hunger and sexual violence rising and no sign of an Eritrean troop withdrawal.

Mark Lowcock told a closed-door meeting of the U.N. Security Council that his office is starting to receive reports of people starving to death, according to a copy of his remarks seen by VOA.

Ofla woreda, in Tigray

""We received the first report this week of four internally displaced people dying from hunger. I then received a report just this morning of 150 people dying from hunger in Ofla woreda [district] — just south of Mekelle,"" Lowcock told council members. ""This should alarm us all. It is a sign of what lies ahead if more action is not taken. Starvation as a weapon of war is a violation.""

Mekelle is the capital of Tigray. The region has been the epicenter of hostilities since November, when fighters from the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) attacked federal government army bases in the region, according to the federal government. The attack, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said, prompted his government to launch a military offensive to push the group out.

Abandoned villages

Lowcock said that as of the end of March, Ethiopia's Bureau of Labor and Social Affairs estimates that 1.7 million people in Tigray have been displaced from their homes.

FILE - A woman leans on the wall of a damaged house that was shelled as federal-aligned forces entered the city, in Wukro, north of Mekelle, capital of Tigray. The region has been beset by hostilities since November.

""Since then, hundreds of thousands have been fleeing from Western Tigray — and still are — with many villages having been abandoned entirely,"" he said.

Lowcock said aid workers are having difficulty reaching the needy and vulnerable, as ""the vast majority"" of Tigray is completely or partially inaccessible to aid workers, either because of fighting or denial of access.

The outbreak of hostilities began around harvest season, and it follows a severe locust infestation. Food insecurity is growing, and next season's food supply is also under threat if fighting does not stop in time for farmers to plant.

The United Nations estimates that at least 4.5 million of Tigray's nearly 6 million people need humanitarian aid. The Ethiopian government has put the figure even higher — at 91% of the population.

Despite obstacles and danger, humanitarians have been able to reach more than 1.7 million with some form of emergency assistance.

Next week, the U.N. will appeal for $1.5 billion to assist 16 million people in Ethiopia this year.

No sign of withdrawal

On March 26, Abiy said Eritrea had agreed to withdraw its forces from Tigray, but Lowcock told council members there is no evidence this has happened.

""Unfortunately, I must say that neither the U.N. nor any of the humanitarian agencies we work with have seen proof of Eritrean withdrawal,"" he said. ""We have, however, heard some reports of Eritrean soldiers now wearing Ethiopian Defense Force uniforms.""

The U.S. ambassador issued a statement following the closed-door meeting, noting credible reports that Eritrean forces are changing into Ethiopian military uniforms ""in order to remain in Tigray indefinitely.""

""The Eritrean government must withdraw its forces from Ethiopia immediately,"" Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said.

Reports of atrocities

Lowcock said humanitarian workers continue to report new atrocities committed by Eritrean forces. Most alarming, he said, are the widespread reports of rapes and gang rapes against civilians.

Diplomats said the U.N. humanitarian chief recounted the horrific story of one survivor, who hid in the forest with her family for six days. During that time, she gave birth to a baby who died a few days later. Her husband was killed. And while she tried to get her remaining children to safety, she encountered four Eritrean soldiers who raped her in front of her children all night and into the following day.

""The majority of rapes are committed by men in uniform,"" Lowcock told council members. ""Cases reported have involved the Ethiopian National Defense Force, Eritrean Defense Forces, Amhara Special Forces, and other irregular armed groups or aligned militia.""

During a Wednesday meeting of the Security Council that focused on the issue of sexual violence in conflict, many council members expressed concern about reports coming from Tigray and called for independent, credible investigations to be conducted to hold perpetrators accountable.

The U.N. official whose office monitors and works to prevent sexual violence in conflict, Pramila Patten, told that meeting that more than 100 allegations of rape have been recorded since November.

""It may be many months before we know the full scale and magnitude — the extent and impact — of these atrocities,"" she said.

Patten noted health care workers are documenting new cases of rape and gang rape daily, ""despite their fear of reprisals and attacks on the limited shelters and clinics still in operation.""",860,5365,7,44
0,Mexico: Communities want Bonafont water gone,https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/mexico-communities-want-bonafont-water-gone,"United States and European water bottling companies are making huge profits from packaging and selling Mexico’s water resources, while leaving locals without water.

Indigenous and local communities in Puebla state united in a 24-hour peaceful blockade of a Bonafont plant, which has continued for weeks.

People from Almoloya, Tlautla, Colonia José Ángeles, Ometoxtla, Zacatepec, Cuanalá, Nextetelco, Coronango, Tepalcatepec, Cuachayotla, Cuapan, Xoxtla and Cuautlancingo have shut the plant down and are demanding it pack up and leave.

“Things were wonderful 20 years ago, but now the Bonafont plant is here working day and night, drying up our wells and rivers. There were fish and frogs before, but now it is all dried up.

“Bonafont is an act of death, because now we can’t get any water from our wells … we have to buy water from pipas (privately owned trucks that sell water) and it’s expensive and isn’t enough to last the week,” said Gloria Mejias Cinto, a member of the Land and Water Defenders.

I am talking to her at the protest. Behind us, is a giant mural that says: “Water belongs to the people.”

Behind the food table are lots of children’s drawings about the importance of water. On the other side, people rest near their tents.

People from the different towns rotate on guard duty at the protest night and day. Large piles of rocks and concrete stop any company trucks from getting in or out.

“We’ll hold this protest until there is a resolution, until Bonafont leaves our country. Then we’ll hold assemblies of all our towns (in the area) and decide what to do,” said Mejias.

“Our water isn’t for sale, it’s not merchandise.”

The big and pointless business of bottling water

According to workers at the Bonafont plant, it extracts 1.4 million litres of water a day from the nearby Iztaccíhuatl volcanic springs, in the east of Puebla state.

One worker, who spoke anonymously to La Jornada de Oriente, said the pandemic emergency measures resulted in a 30% rise in demand for the 19-litre containers of filtered water.

The Bonafont plant has been in the area since 1996, and it legally has access to two drill sites to extract water, but locals say it is secretly extracting water in a third location, without the required permits.

Bonafont is a brand owned by Danone, a Paris-based food corporation. Danone claims it is taking steps to “tackle global water challenges” and its message in Mexico and other countries is of “healthy hydration”. However, bottling spring water hinders rather than helps water supply or hydration.

And while the company profits from taking locals’ water in practice, its spin is about “matching every litre of water sold with a litre for people in need … to help 50 million people in developing countries access safe drinking water”.

304_gloria_mejias_cinto_cr_tamara_pearson.jpg Gloria Mehias Cinto. Photo: Tamara Pearson

There are some 16,000 water purification and bottling plants in Mexico. The country is the biggest consumer globally of bottled water, though it is worth noting that most bottled water comes in recycled 19-litre containers.

Danone, Coca-Cola and Pepsico dominate the bottled water market nationally, at 82%, while in Puebla state, Nestle Water and US company, Keurig Dr Pepper also profit from the market. Nestle takes water from the springs of the Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl volcanos.

These companies pay, on average, 2600 pesos (AU$168) per year for a concession to extract water.

Depending on the size of the bottle and local water rates, bottled water can be up to 3000 times more expensive than tap water. Treating tap water also involves much less energy than producing or recycling plastic bottles, cleaning them, labelling them and transporting them.

In addition, about six litres of water are used to produce 1.5 litres of bottled water.

It is the profits, rather than “healthy hydration” or the environment that drive this market. Globally, the bottled water market was valued at US$217.66 billion last year and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 11.1% from 2021–28.

Here in Mexico, foreign-owned bottling companies aren’t the only ones leaving locals without water. Thousands of largely US- and European-owned factories and mines benefit from the resource, while contaminating the water supply with total impunity.

A Coca Cola plant in Chiapas, for example, extracts more than 1.14 million litres of water a day, leaving indigenous and poor locals forced to consume the soft drink, as they are left without water, and it is often cheaper and easier to get than bottled water.

Some 60% of the rivers and catchment areas in Mexico are polluted. But with politicians and water and environmental monitoring bodies accepting bribes from foreign and local factories and corporations, and with the pressure from the US via trade agreements to make Mexico as agreeable as possible to foreign companies, it is unlikely the water situation will change soon.

0,Toxic puffer fish mass washouts in Cape Town,https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/sci-tech/2021-03-25-toxic-puffer-fish-mass-washouts-in-cape-town/,"Tetrodotoxin is about 25 times more powerful than cyanide and if ingested in large enough doses will cause paralysis before death.

The American Center for Disease Control says that death from ingesting tetrodotoxin can occur as early as 20 minutes or as late as 24 hours.

City officials are not sure what exactly caused the mass puffer fish deaths as there were no adverse water conditions, red tide, or pollution leading up to the deaths.

True to their name, however, puffer fish tend to inflate themselves when threatened and the city says that a massive fish fight as a result of mass courtship may have led to many male fish inflating and being washed ashore by the wind.

“The department of environment forestry and fisheries (DEFF) has reported and confirmed that there were no adverse (pollution) water conditions or red-tide toxins that may have caused this large scale mortality,” said Nieuwoudt.

“The DEFF has indicated that here are, however, some interesting causes of past puffer fish mortalities recorded in SA and elsewhere. These include mass courtship; spawning and fighting which sees the male puffer fish inflate themselves, and then sometimes get rolled or blown out of the water by waves and/or wind. The City can therefore not confirm the exact cause of the mortalities,” she said.

The city said it would continue to monitor the affected areas.

“We want to assure residents that the cleanup operations will be ongoing. The puffer fish is not for human or animal consumption, so we advise that all beachgoers and dog walkers avoid areas that may still need to be cleaned,” said the statement.

“Due to the reporting of a few puffer fish spotted at Fish Hoek beach, the coastal management team is now sweeping the area and will continue to monitor this beach as well,” said Nieuwoudt.

According to the city, oceanographic and meteorological conditions contributing to the development of algal blooms or so-called ‘red tides’, low-oxygen conditions, large temperature differences (icy to warm water), washouts and mortalities of fish and invertebrates on the West Coast, False Bay and the rest of SA are monitored and tracked by the National Oceans and Coastal Information Management System (OCIMS), a partnership between DFFE, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and the SA Environment Observation Network (SAEON).

Similar large-scale fish deaths have been reported recently along the Eastern Cape coast near Gqeberha where a sudden change in temperature resulted in fish being stunned, causing them to wash ashore.

Some 350,000 Hong Kong people hold BNO passports and a further 2.5 million are eligible for one. Image: Shutterstock

Hong Kong people are applying for the bespoke visa route for British National Overseas passport holders at a rate of 3,000 per week, The Times newspaper reported on Friday, quoting leaked figures.



More than 35,000 British National Overseas (BNO) citizens from Hong Kong have applied for the five-year scheme, The Times reported.



The immigration route was offered to Hong Kong people in light of Beijing’s crackdown in the territory.



The British Home Office has forecast that between 123,000 and 153,000 BNO citizens and their dependants will apply in the first year, the newspaper reported.



It said some 350,000 Hongkongers hold BNO passports and a further 2.5 million are eligible for one.



With an additional 2.5 million dependants, up to 5.4 million Hongkongers could apply for the visa and a path to full British citizenship.



The UK government has put no limits on the number who could be admitted but expects many to stay in Hong Kong or prefer to move to places in the region, such as Taiwan or Singapore.



The permanent scheme offers a much more generous visa than previous routes for Hongkongers, including five years’ leave to remain. After the five years they will be able to apply for settled status and after a further 12 months they will be able to apply for citizenship.



This month London announced a £43 million fund to help Hongkongers to integrate into local communities. The programme will use 12 “welcome hubs” to help them to access housing, education and employment to build a life in the UK.



A British government spokesman said: “This new visa route reflects the UK’s historic and moral commitment to those people of Hong Kong who chose to retain their ties to the UK by taking up BNO status . . . [they] will be expected to be self-sufficient and contribute to UK society and the implementation of this visa is estimated to have a net positive impact on the UK.”",351,2075,8,45

Reuters is for the first time reporting details of the latest round of meetings and the discussions about the future of Ma's control of Ant, exercised through a complicated structure of investment vehicles. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Ma had offered in a November meeting with regulators to hand over parts of Ant to the Chinese government. https://on.wsj.com/2QvkHbc

Officials from the central bank, People's Bank of China (PBOC), and financial regulator China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) held talks between January and March with Ma and Ant separately, where the possibility of the tycoon's exit from the company was discussed, according to accounts provided by the source familiar with the regulators' thinking and one of the sources with close ties to the company.

Ant denied that a divestment of Ma's stake was ever under consideration. ""Divestment of Mr. Ma's stake in Ant Group has never been the subject of discussions with anyone,"" an Ant spokesman said in a statement.

Reuters could not determine whether Ant and Ma would proceed with a divestment option, and if so, which one. The company hoped Ma's stake, which is worth billions of dollars, could be sold to existing investors in Ant or its e-commerce affiliate Alibaba Group Holding Ltd without involving any external entity, one of the sources with company ties said.

But the second source also with company connections said that during discussions with regulators, Ma was told that he would not be allowed to sell his stake to any entity or individual close to him, and would instead have to exit completely. Another option would be to transfer his stake to a Chinese investor affiliated with the state, the source said.

Any move would need Beijing's approval, both sources with knowledge of the company's thinking said.

The accounts provided by all the three sources are consistent in terms of the timeline for how discussions have evolved over the past few months. On the company side, one source said Ma met regulators more than once before the Chinese New Year, which was in early February. And the second source said Ant started working on options for Ma's possible exit about a couple of months ago. The source familiar with the regulators' thinking said Ant had told officials during a meeting sometime before mid-March that it was working on options.

The source familiar with the regulators' thinking has direct knowledge of conversations between Ant and officials, while one of the sources with company ties has been briefed on Ma's interactions with regulators and Ant's plans. The other one has direct knowledge of Ant's discussions about options. They requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.

The Ant spokesman did not provide any comments from Ma. Alibaba referred questions to Ant. Jack Ma's office did not respond to Reuters' request for comment made via Ant. The State Council Information Office, PBOC, and CBIRC, also did not respond to requests for comment.

The high-stakes discussions come amid a revamp of Ant and a broader regulatory clampdown on China's technology sector that was set in motion after Ma's public criticism of regulators in a speech in October last year.

Ma's exit could help clear the way for Ant to revive plans to go public, which stalled after the tycoon's speech, both sources proximate to the company said. Ant, which was about to raise an estimated $37 billion in what would have been the world's largest initial public offering, aborted plans the day after Ma's Nov. 2 meeting with regulators.

'TOO BIG FOR THEIR BRITCHES'

Since then Beijing has unleashed a series of investigations and new regulations that have not only reined in Ma's empire but also swept across the country's technology sector, including other high-profile, billionaire entrepreneurs.

For Ma, 56, who also founded Alibaba and once commanded cult-like reverence in China, the consequences have been particularly severe. The tycoon completely withdrew from the public eye for about three months and has continued to keep a low profile after a brief January appearance. read more

China's antitrust regulator fined Alibaba a record $2.75 billion on April 10 following an antimonopoly probe that found it had abused its dominant market position for several years. A couple of days later Ant was asked by the central bank to become a financial holding company, bringing it under the ambit of banking rules that it had managed to avoid so far and allowed it to grow rapidly. read more

""China still likes to promote its technology firms as global leaders just as long as they don't get too big for their britches,"" said Andrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research.

CONTROLLING STAKE

Although Ma had previously stepped down from corporate positions, he retains effective control over Ant and significant influence over Alibaba.

While he only owns a 10% stake in Ant, Ma exercises control over the company through related entities, according to Ant's IPO prospectus.

Hangzhou Yunbo, an investment vehicle for Ma, has control over two other entities that own a combined 50.5% stake of Ant, the prospectus shows. Yunbo can decide all matters related to Ant and exercise the combined voting power of the three entities, the prospectus shows.

Ma holds a 34% equity interest in Yunbo, the prospectus shows.

One of the sources with company ties said there's ""a big chance"" Ma would sell his equity interest in Yunbo to exit from Ant, ultimately paving the way for the fintech major to move closer to completing its revamp and reviving its listing.

Reuters could not reach Yunbo for comment. Ant did not provide a comment on behalf of Yunbo.

But its main competitor, Pfizer — which also produces a highly effective mRNA vaccine against the novel coronavirus — has said it will send millions more doses to Canada in May, June and beyond, a commitment that will more than cover the shortfall from Moderna.

Massachusetts-based Moderna was poised to send 1.2 million more doses to Canada this month, but that shipment has been cut back to just 650,000 shots.

While those vaccines were to arrive next week, the reduced shipment is now not expected until later this month — possibly as late as the first week of May.

And although Canada was expecting to receive 12.3 million doses of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine by the end of June, the company has now told officials that it will be one to two million shots short of that goal. Delivery of those doses will be pushed into the July-through-September period.

Pfizer steps up

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday that while the delay in Moderna's shipments is disappointing, Canada has now signed an agreement with Pfizer for eight million more vaccine doses on top of what has already been promised.

Canada will receive four million more Pfizer doses in May, another two million in June and two million more in July, Trudeau said.

That means Canada's immunization campaign will have access to two million doses per week of the Pfizer product in May and 2.5 million shots per week in the month of June — vaccine stocks that are badly needed as the country grapples with a punishing third wave of cases.

""I want to thank everyone at Pfizer for their cooperation and hard work, not just to keep deliveries on schedule, but to move more doses up and reach new agreements,"" Trudeau said.

Trudeau said that despite disruptions at its European facilities in January, when plant upgrades resulted in dramatically reduced shipments, Pfizer has proven to be a very reliable supplier. He said its product will constitute the ""bulk of the vaccinations we're going to be giving Canadians in the coming months.""

Pfizer to send millions of additional doses of COVID-19 vaccine to Canada between May and July Politics News 1:18 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that Canada will receive 4 million additional doses of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine in May, another 2 million in June and 2 million more in July. 1:18

Canada is now expecting 23.8 million doses of the Pfizer product in the second quarter of this year alone, up from the 17.8 million doses that had been expected.

Even with the Moderna disruptions — which could punt delivery of up to two million shots to a later date — Canada will receive at least 4 million more shots in May and June than anticipated, thanks to the Pfizer deal.

The country is now expecting delivery of 48 to 50 million doses from all vaccine suppliers in the first six months of this year.

Based on those figures, Trudeau said, every Canadian adult should be able to receive at least one dose by the end of June.

The Moderna delays are being attributed to ""a slower than anticipated ramp-up of their production capacity"" at plants in Europe, Public Services and Procurement Minister Anita Anand said.

""We are disappointed, and while we understand the challenges facing suppliers in the current global market for vaccines, our government will continue to press Moderna to fulfil its commitments,"" Anand said.

""Remember, a year ago vaccines didn't exist for COVID-19. Supply chains and manufacturing systems did not exist either.""

""When Moderna provides additional information, we will share it as soon as it is received. We continue to press Moderna for consistency of supply to Canada,"" Anand said.

The 855,000 doses of the Moderna product that were supposed to arrive the week of April 5 have only started to show up over the last several days, hampering planned immunization clinics in some provinces.

To help offset the short-term supply gap, Anand said Johnson & Johnson has confirmed the first shipment of its one-dose viral vector shot will arrive at month's end.

The U.S.-based pharmaceutical giant will send 300,000 doses to Canada during the week of April 27 with ""more substantial deliveries coming in the latter part of this quarter and into the summer,"" she said.

Moderna making 'adjustments'

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the Moderna delays will result in more vaccination cancellations at public health and hospital-run clinics in the province.

He urged the prime minister to secure more vaccine supply to help the province beat back the third wave that has strained hospital capacity.

""By hook or by crook or whatever,"" Ford said, the federal government needs to procure more shots for Ontario.

""If we continue getting dribs and drabs and missing Moderna shipments, we aren't getting out of this. More people are going to die, more people will be in ICUs. If we can ramp it up to 300,000 a day ... it's night and day,"" Ford said, pointing to modelling numbers that suggest administering thousands more shots a day would bend the infection curve.

""It all comes down to one thing, the supply of vaccines, as simple as that. The bottom line is, would we be in this position if we were getting 300,000 vaccines back in February? The answer is absolutely not. We wouldn't be facing the crisis.""

In a statement, a spokesperson for Moderna said it would be making ""adjustments"" to the number of shots it sends to Canada and some other countries in the coming weeks.

""The trajectory of vaccine manufacturing ramp-up is not linear, and despite best efforts, there is a shortfall in previously estimated doses from the European supply chain. Vaccine manufacturing is a highly complex process and a number of elements, including human and material resources, have factored into this volatility,"" the spokesperson said.

The company said it will make ""substantial capital investments"" to bolster production and explore ""other potential collaboration opportunities"" so that it can make more shots to meet insatiable global demand for its highly effective product.

Before COVID-19 hit, Moderna had no experience in producing such products on a large scale. It has partnered with Switzerland-based pharmaceutical manufacturer Lonza to help make its vaccine. The company also has contracted with other companies in the U.S. to pump out its mRNA vaccines for the American marketplace.",1182,7228,7,45

EU Delegation in Vienna/Handout via REUTERS

A new understanding is emerging at talks aimed at salvaging Iran's nuclear deal with global powers, Tehran's chief negotiator said on Saturday according to Iranian state media, as China's delegate also reported progress.

Abbas Araqchi said after a meeting of remaining parties to the 2015 deal that the Iranian delegation had submitted proposed texts on nuclear issues and the lifting of sanctions, and that work on a common text, ""at least in areas where there are common views"", could begin.

Iran has breached many of the deal's restrictions on its nuclear activities in response to the U.S. withdrawal and reimposition of sanctions against Tehran under President Donald Trump.

Araqchi was quoted as saying that, while serious disagreements remained, ""a new understanding appears to be emerging.""

The second round of talks began on Thursday in a luxury Vienna hotel. The United States, making a new diplomatic push in the Middle East under Joe Biden's administration, is not present as Iran has declined face-to-face negotiation.

However, European Union officials chairing the talks are carrying out shuttle diplomacy with a U.S. delegation based at another hotel across the road.

Negotiators are working on steps that both sides must take, on sanctions and nuclear activities, to return to full compliance, but the talks have been further complicated by an explosion at Iran's main uranium-enrichment facility at Natanz.

Iran has responded by saying it is enriching uranium to 60% fissile purity, a big step towards weapons-grade from the 20% it had previously achieved. read more

China's envoy to the talks earlier said all participants - China, Russia, France, Britain, Germany and Iran - had agreed to accelerate work on issues including which sanctions the United States would lift.

""All parties have agreed to further pick up their pace in subsequent days by engaging (in) more extensive, substantive work on sanctions-lifting as well as other relevant issues,"" Wang Qun told reporters.

Tehran says the Natanz blast was an act of sabotage by Israel and on Saturday named a suspect. Israel has not formally commented on the incident.

Wang, the only envoy who regularly speaks to reporters outside the talks, said remaining parties to the deal had resumed ""productive and constructive work"" over the past two days.

""In the next few days we hope the Joint Commission will immediately start negotiating the specific formula of sanction-lifting,"" he added, using the term for formal meetings of those parties.

0,Wife of GB wrestling champion refused UK visa,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/visa-wrestling-champion-britain-mohammed-mokaev-home-office-b1832831.html,"The wife of a British wrestling champion who has won gold medals for the country has hit out at the UK’s “cruel” immigration rules after his wife was refused a visa.

Muhammad Mokaev, 20, a professional fighter who has won gold medals for Britain, said he was “surprised” when the Home Office declined to issue a visitor’s visa to his wife, Khava Eldarbekova, in February this year.

The refugee, who came to Britain with his family in 2012 after fleeing political persecution in Dagestan, Russia, had been hoping his Ms Eldarbekova, 25, whom he married by Islamic marriage in October 2020, would be able to visit the UK to meet his father for the first time.

But the Home Office refused the visa in February, saying they hadn’t provided enough evidence that she had sufficient ties to Russia, her home country, or Bahrain, where she currently lives, and that the department was “not satisfied” that she would leave the UK.

The couple applied for a second time with additional evidence, and it was refused again.

This time, the Home Office said Ms Eldarbekova had £4,884 in her bank account for which she did not “explain the source” and which they said therefore could have “been inflated for the purposes of obtaining an entry clearance”.

Mr Mokaev said the money had been the income from her job in medical therapy. He added: “It’s not a lot of money to hold on an account. It’s not criminal. We have no criminal record. She’s not going to stay in the UK illegally. We showed everything on the papers.

“And there was exactly the same amount of money in her bank account the first time but they didn’t include it in that refusal, only the second time it was an issue. Why didn’t they include it the first time?”

The 20-year-old, who is a six-time British wrestling champion, told The Independent the situation was impacting on his ability to perform in the sport.

“It is very hard to stay focused with this situation going on, not knowing what’s going to happen,” he said.

“In March I had a fight in Bahrain, but I had to be in a visa centre in the morning. I missed the bus going to the arena. I was meant to be there for media, medicals and signings for sponsors, but I was in the visa centre until 1pm to sort out the application. It was a headache.”

The couple spent around £2,500 on submitting the two applications, and the refusal letters state that there is no right of appeal, so they have no option but to pay for a third application or give up.

The athlete said it was not the first time he had faced issues with the UK immigration system.

His family’s refugee application took five years to be processed, and now – due to the rule that a refugee must wait five years before applying for British citizenship – he is unable to compete in a number of major international competitions.

Mr Mokaev said he had been picked to compete in both the Tokyo Olympics later this year and the Commonwealth Games 2022 in Birmingham, but that despite his efforts to request his application is expedited to allow him to take part, the Home Office had declined.

“I’ve missed the opportunity of the Commonwealth Games in 2022, I missed Tokyo 2021 which is happening in 99 days, and now they’ve declined my wife’s visa. It’s getting crazy.

“And it’s not just me, it’s many people they do this to. I don’t like to say it but the Home Office is treating people badly.”

Human rights lawyer Shoaib Khansaid the decision to refuse Ms Eldarbekova’s visa was “absolutely disgusting, cruel and nasty”.

He added: “The immigration rules are awful and Priti Patel’s Home Office enforces them in an even worse way. Solidarity with Muhammad and the thousands of perfectly decent, law-abiding families needlessly separated by the Tories.”

At least 19 civilians were killed when armed men raided a village in west Niger close to the border with Mali, officials have said, in the latest bloodshed in the troubled region.

The governor of Tillaberi region said dozens of heavily armed attackers on motorbikes stormed the village of Gaigorou on Saturday evening.

Governor Ibrahim Tidjani Katiella told DPA news agency the attackers, who likely came from Mali, surrounded the village and then started killing the inhabitants.

A municipal official from Dessa on Sunday confirmed that 19 people were killed and two others wounded in the attack.

He told AFP news agency that the assailants initially attacked people at a funeral, before going on to the village where they “shot at everyone they saw,” the official said.

The Tillaberi region is situated on the lawless “three-border” zone where the frontiers of Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso converge and has regularly been the target of armed groups affiliated to the ISIL (ISIS) group.

“What concerns us a lot is this escalation of violence and insecurity that is recently taking place in the region,” Katiella, the governor, said in March.

Thirteen people were killed last month when armed men on motorbikes raided the villages of Zibane-Koira Zeno, Zibane Koira-Tegui and Gadabo.

The identity of the triangle- or pyramid-shaped aerial objects remains a mystery. The Defense Department isn’t sharing what it knows.

The photos and videos were first published by the Mystery Wire and Extraordinary Beliefs websites. The objects were photographed zipping over the USS Russell off San Diego in July 2019, according to investigative filmmaker Jeremy Corbell.

Photos of three unidentified flying objects reportedly taken in March that year — one spherical, another “acorn” shaped, and one described as a “metallic blimp” — were also taken by Navy personnel, Pentagon spokesperson Susan Gough told CNN.

Mystery Wire’s George Knapp reported that those objects were photographed off Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia by an F-18 weapons systems officer seated behind the pilot, who used his iPhone.

Gough offered no details on either of the sightings.

“To maintain operations security and to avoid disclosing information that may be useful to potential adversaries, the Department of Defense does not discuss publicly the details of either the observations or the examinations of reported incursions into our training ranges or designated airspace — including those incursions initially designated as UAP,” Gough told CNN, using the abbreviation for Unidentified Aerial Phenomena.

0,Chinese Militia Vessels Depart South China Sea,https://thediplomat.com/2021/04/chinese-militia-vessels-departing-contested-south-china-sea-reef/,"Advertisement

In mid-March, the Philippines discovered that a reef in its exclusive economic zone was being occupied by scores of nearly identical Chinese fishing vessels, later determined to be part of China’s shadowy, para-military maritime militia. Their presence sparked fears that China could be making a move to seize effective control over a new feature in the hotly disputed South China Sea.

According to the Philippines’ secretary of foreign affairs, only a handful of Chinese militia vessels remained at Whitsun Reef as of April 13.

Called the Julian Felipe Reef by the Philippines and Niu’e Jiao by China, Whitsun Reef is 170 nautical miles west of Palawan in the northern part of the Spratly Islands, where China has built up several large artificial islands on formerly submerged reefs and constructed major military installations.

At one point, the Philippines defense department counted 220 Chinese vessels at the reef. Many or most are believed to have been part of China’s maritime militia, lightly armed paramilitary vessels that China uses to harass and coerce other Southeast Asian countries’ fishermen in waters China claims as its own. Maritime militia vessels were also responsible for the infamous harassment of a U.S. Navy surveillance ship in 2009.

Asked whether China intended to keep a permanent presence at Whitsun Reef, a spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry said that “China has no such plan.” But he also reiterated China’s position that the reef was Chinese territory, and that a 2016 United Nations tribunal ruling in the Philippines’ favor over contested South China Sea features was “illegal, null and void.” The Philippines should “immediately stop wanton hype-up,” the spokesman added.

He also insisted that the vessels were fishing boats sheltering from a storm – “It is a customary practice running over a thousand years for Chinese fishing boats to work and shelter in relevant waters” – and that they were not part of China’s maritime militia.

Photographs of the flotilla showed little or no evidence of fishing equipment on the vessels, however. Analysts from the U.S. Naval War College were able to prove that several of the vessels were known to be part of the maritime militia, and most others matched a type that was purpose-built for the militia units for Sansha City, which China uses to administer its claimed territory and waters in the South China Sea.

The Philippines’ defense secretary demanded that China recall the vessels and the secretary of state filed a diplomatic protest to Beijing. The Philippines sent a naval task force to patrol the area and U.S. warships have been concentrating in the region over the past week, including a carrier strike group and an amphibious group.

The insistence by China’s Foreign Ministry that the vessels were taking refuge from “rough sea conditions” in the reef was belied by the succession of photographs taken over the past few weeks showing the boats floating in calm waters.

The Philippines is haunted by the effective loss of its control over the Scarborough Shoal in 2012 when China reneged on a U.S.-brokered deal for both countries to pull back their vessels from a mounting standoff. China continues to fish there and patrol the shoal with both maritime militia and coast guard vessels, denying its use to Filipino fishermen who have trawled its waters for generations. When it appeared that China was preparing to reclaim and build on Scarborough Shoal in the same way it had in the Spratly Islands, the United States reportedly intervened behind the scenes to deter Beijing. China’s long-term aims at Whitsun Reef are unclear and may still be undecided by Chinese leadership.

It is not clear why China’s militia vessels are vacating the reef now, and whether, or when, they may return. In the worst case, they could return with back up from China’s coast guard or the navy. If China moved that aggressively, it could spark a significant crisis. China’s island construction to date all occurred on features that China had previously occupied. Seizing control of a new reef and building military facilities on it would be a significant escalation of its efforts to expand control over the South China Sea.",728,4469,7,46
0,Deadly car bomb rocks Iraq’s Sadr City: Police,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/15/car-bomb-kills-four-in-baghdads-sadr-city-say-police,"Iraqi police and medical sources say at least four people killed and 17 others wounded in the blast in the mainly Shia neighbourhood of Baghdad.

At least four people have been killed and 17 others wounded in a car bomb attack in the Sadr City neighbourhood of the Iraqi capital Baghdad, police and medical sources said on Thursday.

The car was parked at a busy second-hand equipment market in the mainly Shia district, police said.

An Iraqi military statement said the blast killed one civilian, wounded 12 others and set several vehicles on fire. Medics in Sadr City put the death toll at four.

Five cars were also destroyed in the blast, the military-linked Security Media Cell reported.

The explosion was caused by an explosive device attached to a parked car at the market, Baghdad police said without providing further details.

Black smoke was rising from the market place and ambulances rushed to save the wounded, Reuters news agency reported, citing witnesses. Police cordoned off the site of the blast shortly afterwards.

Firefighters inspect the site of a car bomb attack in Sadr City district of Baghdad, Iraq April 15, 2021. [Wissam al-Okili/Reuters] There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. It was the second major deadly bombing to hit Baghdad this year after twin suicide attacks claimed by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, or ISIS) fighters killed at least 32 people in a crowded market in January.

Large bomb attacks, once an almost daily occurrence in the Iraqi capital, have halted in recent years since ISIL was defeated in 2017, part of an overall improvement in security that has brought normal life back to Baghdad.

The January blast was the most deadly in three years.

Thursday’s attack comes during an election year, a time when tension between rival Iraqi political groups has often caused violence in the past.

The populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, after whom Sadr city is named and who commands a following of millions of Iraqis, counts among his enemies both ISIL and rival Shia parties with militias backed by Iran.

On Wednesday, separate violence linked to regional rivalries saw an explosives-laden drone target US forces at Iraq’s Erbil airport in northern Iraq and a separate rocket attack kill a Turkish soldier at a military base nearby.

0,Bill Gates Impeded Global Access Covid Vaccines,https://newrepublic.com/article/162000/bill-gates-impeded-global-access-covid-vaccines,"His latest move is to institutionalize the ACT-Accelerator as the central organizing institution in future pandemics. The shortages have made this effort a little awkward, however, and Gates is now forced to reckon with the question of technology transfer. This is an aspect of the equitable access debate that doesn’t concern intellectual property as commonly perceived—as a simple matter of patents and licenses—but access to the components and technical knowledge related to practical manufacture, including biological material and other areas otherwise protected under the category of intellectual property known as trade secrets. The global south and civil society groups have been calling for tech transfer for months—either mandatory tech transfer that could have been written into contracts or through a voluntary mechanism associated with C-TAP—but Gates has predictably arrived on the scene with a more familiar plan in hand.

In early March, senior Gates staff joined pharma executives for a “Global C19 Vaccine Supply Chain and Manufacturing Summit” convened by Chatham House in London. The main agenda item: plans for a new arm within the ACT-Accelerator, the Covid Vaccine Capacity Connector, that seeks to address the tech-transfer question within the usual frame of monopoly rights and bilateral licensing.

“The tech transfer debate is being decisively seized and shaped by those who want to set the terms and conditions under which knowledge can be transferred,” writes Priti Patnaik in her Geneva Health Files newsletter. A Gates-directed tech-transfer mechanism without meaningful input from WHO members states, she writes, would be a “body blow” to C-TAP and similar future initiatives that promote open licensing and knowledge sharing to maximize production and access.

There are signs of overdue scrutiny of Gates’s role in public health and lifelong commitment to exclusive intellectual property rights. But so far these are blips. More common is the deference on display in a March 21 New York Times article about the U.S. government’s role in developing the mRNA vaccines now under the monopoly control of Moderna and Pfizer. When the piece turned to Gates’s inevitable cameo, the Times reporter was hovering right over the target—and somehow managed to miss wide by a mile. Instead of probing Gates’s central role in preserving this paradigm, the paper linked to gentle boilerplate about pricing and access found on the Gates Foundation website. In response to a request for comment, a Gates Foundation spokesperson pointed me to a piece by its CEO, Mark Suzman, arguing that “IP fundamentally underpins innovation, including the work that has helped create vaccines so quickly.”

Any change in media coverage of Gates’s second career may produce a delayed echo within the world he has come to dominate. Here Gates not only controls the narratives, he controls most of the payroll. This may sound conspiratorial or overblown to outsiders but not to campaigners who have witnessed Gates’s ability to shift gravity on major issues.

“If you said to an ordinary person, ‘We’re in a pandemic. Let’s figure out everyone who can make vaccines and give them everything they need to get online as fast as possible,’ it would be a no-brainer,” says James Love. “But Gates won’t go there. Neither will the people dependent on his funding. He has immense power. He can get you fired from a U.N. job. He knows that if you want to work in global public health, you’d better not make an enemy of the Gates Foundation by questioning its positions on I.P. and monopolies. And there are a lot of advantages to being on his team. It’s a sweet, comfortable ride for a lot of people.”

*Among journalists echoing this argument was former New Republic editor Andrew Sullivan. When The New York Times reported Sullivan was defending the companies’ lawsuit while taking undisclosed funding from PhRma, the industry trade association, Sullivan remained defiant in the face of evidence-based accusations that he was an unethical journalist. “It behooves me to say I see absolutely no problems with [drug industry sponsorship],” he told Salon. “In fact, I am extremely proud to get some support from a great industry.” It later turned out that Africans adhered more closely to the twice-daily pill regimens than patient populations in rich countries.

A train accident north of Cairo on Sunday left 11 people dead and 98 others injured, Egypt's health ministry said, in the latest rail calamity to hit the North African country.

The ministry, in an updated toll, said that ""11 people were killed and 98 others injured in a train accident in Toukh"", a small farming town in the fertile Nile Delta about 40 kilometres (25 miles) outside the capital.

Egypt's cabinet said in a statement that four carriages of the train heading from Cairo to Mansoura, a Delta city, came off the tracks.

Dozens of ambulances were dispatched to the site, the health ministry added, and investigators have been sent to determine the accident's cause.

President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi tasked the military's engineering authority on Sunday with investigating the latest incident, which came on the heels of a deadly train crash last month that left at least 20 people dead.

Authorities have not yet provided a reason for Sunday's derailment.

A security source told AFP the driver and other rail officials had been detained for questioning.

The ministry said 14 people who sustained minor injuries were released from a hospital close to the accident site.

Egyptian rail disasters are generally attributed to poor infrastructure and maintenance.

At least 20 people died and 199 were injured last month in a train crash in the country's south, according to the latest official toll, which authorities have revised several times.

The prosecution has alleged that the driver of one train and his assistant had both left the driver's cabin when it crashed into another train.

Transport Minister Kamel el-Wazir -- a former general named to the post after a deadly 2019 train collision -- blamed the March crash on human error.

""We have a problem with the human element,"" he told a TV talk show, where he pledged to put in place an automated network by 2024.

The African Development Bank announced earlier this month a $170 million loan to improve safety on Egypt's rail network.

The bank said the money would be used ""to enhance operational safety and to increase network capacity on national rail lines"".

""The planned upgrades are expected to benefit low-income Egyptians, about 40 percent of the population, who rely on trains as an affordable mode of transport,"" it said in a statement.

One of the country's deadliest train crashes came in 2002, when 373 people died as a fire ripped through a crowded train south of Cairo.

In the first in-person meeting at the White House since President Biden entered office, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said the two leaders discussed the ""severe security environment"" and People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) actions in the Indo-Pacific region.

CHINA WARNS US TO STOP 'PLAYING WITH FIRE' ON TAIWAN

The two nation’s addressed not only China’s increased military involvement in the South China Sea and security measures the PRC is using to pressure Taiwan, but also human right abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong.

""The U.S. and Japan are actually ganging up to form cliques and fanning bloc confrontation,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement Saturday. ""This anachronistic move runs counter to the aspiration for peace, development and cooperation shared by the overwhelming majority of countries in the region and beyond.""

Tensions between China and the U.S. have been on the rise following the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, but Japan has had their own qualms with their Pacific neighbor.

In a statement following the bilateral talks, Japan and the U.S. expressed their concern regarding China’s military involvement around the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea.

The islands, also known as Diaoyu Dao, are uninhabited and administered by Japan, but claimed by China.

""Taiwan and Diaoyu Dao are both Chinese territory. Issues relating to Hong Kong and Xinjiang are purely China's internal affairs,"" the Foreign Ministry said. ""China has indisputable sovereignty over islands in the South China Sea and waters around them.""

Zelenskyy is traveling to Paris to meet with Macron during a working lunch at the Elysee presidential palace. Both heads of state will then talk via videoconference with Merkel, Macron's office said.

The talks come as Ukraine and the West have sounded alarms in recent weeks about the concentration of troops along Russia’s border, a buildup that the U.S. and NATO have described as the largest since 2014.

In an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro, Zelenskyy said “it’s time to stop talking and to make decisions.”

He said Friday's talks notably aim at discussing security issues. “Europe’s security is depending on Ukraine’s security,” he said, adding his country is seeking support from the European Union and the NATO alliance.

“Our goal ... is to de-escalate tensions,” a French official at the French presidency, speaking on condition of anonymity ahead of the talks, said.

“All the work we’re doing is in support of Ukraine’s sovereignty,” the official said.

More than 14,000 people have died in seven years of fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine that erupted after Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula. Efforts to reach a political settlement have stalled, and violations of a shaky truce have become increasingly frequent in recent weeks across Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland known as the Donbas.

In view of the rising Covid cases in the country, the Union Culture Ministry has decided to shut down the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort, Fatehpur Sikri, and other Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) protected monuments with immediate effect.

The news of the Taj Mahal's closure has disappointed the tourists who had arrived in Agra to view the world-famous monument.

Earlier, the Taj Mahal had remained closed for 188 days during the first wave of the pandemic and in the second wave too. The tentative reopening date of the monument is 15th May, but if the case count continues to increase in the country, the authorities may move up the date.

Talking to India Today, Agra Tourist Welfare Chamber secretary Vishal Sharma said that the monument's closure was being anticipated for the past few days, after the number of tourists arriving at the Taj Mahal had dropped by almost 75 percent, from 13-15 thousand per day, to barely 3-4 thousand this week.

Following the announcement on Wednesday of night curfew in Agra, the number of tourists had gone down to 2,706.

Vishal Sharma said that the Taj Mahal's closure last year from 17th March to 21st September had dealt a huge blow to the tourism industry of Agra and it was just slowly getting back on its feet. Sharma added that this time a lot of tourism-related businesses in Agra could be forced to shut down for good.

Vishal Sharma pointed out that a lot of tourism businesses, especially handicraft emporiums and travel agencies are facing tough times, having been forced to remain closed for over one year. With the second wave of Covid-19 gaining momentum, many businesses may have to finally let go of their staff, which they had been retaining in the hopes of revival of business this year.

""Hydrogen has great potential to emerge as a future source of energy,"" he said. ""The enthusiasm about hydrogen has a simple reason -- whether it's used in a fuel cell or burned to create heat, wherever hydrogen replaces fossil fuels, it slows global warming.""Carbon-free hydrogen can be produced from fossils fuels, such as natural gas or coal, by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using a current of electricity. Hydrogen thus generated can be used as a transport fuel.However, hydrogen supply and distribution in India face challenges such as high production costs and complimentary infrastructure requirements.Speaking at a roundtable on hydrogen economy, Pradhan said the government is ""committed to augmenting the hydrogen supply chain infrastructure in the country"", including integrating it with flagship programs like SATAT that generates compressed biogas from municipal and agri waste.Stating that work was on pilot projects to produce blue hydrogen (from fossil fuels) and green hydrogen (from renewable sources), he said hydrogen was being blended with compressed natural gas (CNG) for use as a transportation fuel as well as an industrial input to refineries.""Fifty buses in Delhi are plying on CNG blended with hydrogen on a pilot basis. We plan to scale it up in the coming months across the major cities of India,"" he said.Pradhan further said various initiatives for the greater use of hydrogen in India's energy mix are being taken, including the recent budget announcement of a National Hydrogen Mission for making a hydrogen roadmap for the country.Indian refineries, he said, are planning to leverage the available surplus hydrogen capacities for meeting the initial demand in mainstreaming hydrogen.One of such projects is underway at Gujarat refinery of Indian Oil wherein the combination of hydrogen production through natural gas and its hyphenation with the carbon capture technology will result in the production of blue hydrogen.Multiple buses powered by fuel cells will be covering various iconic routes.""Efforts are underway to leverage the vast CNG pipeline infrastructure to reduce the transportation cost of hydrogen,"" he said.Stating that global efforts are focused on finding ways to develop a hydrogen economy, he said the contours of India's energy transition roadmap include the development of emerging fuels, particularly hydrogen.""Energy is integral to support our fast-growing economy. We are developing an energy sector which will be growth-centric, industry-friendly and environment-conscious,"" he said. ""This requires ample access to affordable energy to improve the lives of Indians coupled with the need to have a smaller carbon footprint.""The inclusion of hydrogen as an energy carrier in the future energy portfolio presents a unique opportunity to address emerging energy sectors, including power to gas, power to power, and power to mobility and even vehicle to grid applications, he said.""India remains committed to environmental and climate causes with a massive thrust on deploying renewable energy and energy efficiency measures,"" he said, adding India's renewable power portfolio has grown from 32 GW to almost 100 GW in the last six years.India is targeting 450 GW of renewable energy generating capacity by 2030.""Diversification of our energy basket would be the key lever enabling energy transition,"" he said. ""However, it is equally important that the new energy-mix options synergize and co-exist with the established base technology already operational in the respective countries, in which huge capital investments have been made.""The role of hydrogen as a chemical is well known. ""We all now recognize the importance of hydrogen as an energy carrier and efforts are underway to devise ways to harness it in a reliable, cost-effective and safe manner.""""My Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, with a mandate of keeping the energy pipeline flowing, is committed to augmenting the hydrogen supply chain infrastructure in the country. Presently, as in the case of other countries, our petroleum sector is the largest producer of hydrogen for various refinery process operations.""Hence, we realize petroleum sector's capability to produce hydrogen molecules, stored and traded as gas, making it a natural votary of this new energy form,"" he said.The utility of hydrogen is not going to be limited only to the transport sector. ""The maturity of the ecosystem can be accelerated through its usage as a decarbonizing agent for a range of sectors, including industry covering chemicals, iron, steel, fertilizer and refining, transport, heat (domestic and industrial) and power,"" he said.By establishing synergies with natural gas, hydrogen can be easily adopted in the energy mix without seeking major infrastructural overhauling, he said.

0,New Huawei fears over Dutch mobile eavesdropping,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2021/04/18/new-huawei-fears-dutch-mobile-eavesdropping/,"Huawei was able to eavesdrop on all conversations taking place on one of the Netherlands' largest mobile networks, according to a Dutch newspaper report.

Huawei staff both in the Netherlands and in China were able to eavesdrop on all mobile numbers on the KPN network, according to an internal report from 2010, including then Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende and Chinese dissidents living in the Netherlands.

The allegation will raise fresh fears over the use of the Chinese company's technology in mobile networks around the world.

The report, which was obtained by Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant, suggested that publishing these findings could severely damage KPN's reputation. The operator had 6.5m subscribers at the time.

The report said: ""The continued existence of KPN Mobile is in serious danger because permits may be revoked or the government and businesses may give up their confidence in KPN if it becomes known that the Chinese government can eavesdrop on KPN mobile numbers and shut down the network.""

The report also found Huawei staff had the ability to decipher which numbers were tapped by Dutch police and intelligence services.

At the time of the security flaw, KPN's network had already been warned by the domestic security service AIVD about the risks of working with Huawei.

However the telecoms operator asked consulting firm Capgemini to analyse the risks and look into how the Chinese telecoms giant behaved within KPN.",233,1455,7,48
0,Sweden sees sperm deficit as COVID deters donors,https://www.euronews.com/2021/04/15/sweden-sees-sperm-deficit-as-covid-pandemic-deters-donors?utm_source=flipboard.com&amp;utm_campaign=feeds_news&amp;utm_medium=referral,"Health professionals in Sweden are sounding the alarm over concerns of a sperm donation shortage spurred by the coronavirus pandemic.

With sperm donors deterred from travelling to hospitals during the pandemic, doctors at public fertility clinics say the worsening shortage could result in years-long delays for assisted pregnancy treatments.

""Because of the pandemic, many [men] won't come to the hospital because we have social restrictions in place,"" Margareta Kitlinski, a senior consultant at the Centre of Reproductive Medicine at the Skane University Hospital in Malmo, told Euronews on Thursday.

""So, over the last three months we have had to take a pulse and [right now], we don't do any IVF treatment with donor sperms because we simply don't have any,"" she said.

In the midst of the pandemic, Kitlinski said her own clinic has seen its wait times for assisted pregnancy treatments double due to the lack of sperm donations.

""If I compare the figures from two years ago, the waiting list was three months to one year maximum and now we have a waiting list for two years,"" she said. ""I do think the last year has doubled the waiting list.""

Kitlinski said Gothenburg's University Hospital was experiencing a similar shortage, with Stockholm likely to follow.

Indeed, in an interview with Reuters, which first reported on the issue, Ann Thurin Kjellberg, who leads the reproduction unit at Gothenburg's University Hospital, said the clinic was ""running out of sperm"".

""We've never had so few donors as during the last year,"" she said.

Kitlinski did say that public reproduction units in Sweden have seen donor numbers dip in recent years due to the rise of private fertility clinics in the country.

What many donors may not realise, she said, is that they will be paid the same amount of money whether they choose to attend a public or private clinic.

Those seeking assisted pregnancy treatments, however, will have to pay a hefty sum to private fertility clinics, whereas public treatment is free.

At a private clinic, the treatment can cost up to 100,000 Swedish crowns (€9,874), making it inaccessible to many across the country.

According to the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology, Sweden is among the countries with the highest assisted conception rates in the world.

However, the country also has strict policies around sperm donations, with a sperm sample only eligible to be used by a maximum of six women.

Kitlinski said she hopes that more potential donors will come forward over the months ahead.

But with Sweden grappling with a major surge in coronavirus cases over recent weeks, it could take some time before donations begin to pick up again.

On Wednesday, the country recorded 8,879 new COVID-19 cases and 60 deaths within a 24-hour period, bringing its total number of coronavirus cases up to 885,385 and its death toll up to 13,720, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Since the pandemic began last year, Sweden has resisted implementing strict lockdown measures, instead opting to keep the economy largely open and impose less severe restrictions.",509,3123,8,48

Israelis will no longer have to wear masks outdoors starting from Sunday as the number of virus infections plummets, Health Minister Yuli Edelstein said.

""The rate of infection in Israel is very low thanks to the successful vaccine campaign in Israel, and therefore it is possible to ease (restrictions),"" Edelstein said in a statement Thursday.

He said however that masks will still be required indoors.

With close to five million people -- more than half the population of 9.3 million -- vaccinated, Israel continues its world-beating campaign that sent coronavirus infection rates down, AFP reported.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu obtained millions of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines in part by agreeing to share with Pfizer medical data on the product's impact.

The vaccines have transformed life in Israel. In mid-January the country had a peak of some 10,000 new infections a day but the rate is now about 200 cases a day.

The rate of new infections has remained low even after in-person learning resumed and restrictions were loosened on bars, restaurants and indoor gatherings.

Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla was a guest of honor at a government ceremony Wednesday evening marking Israel's 73rd year of independence.

""Together we are demonstrating that through mass vaccinations we can defeat the Covid-19 pandemic and save lives,"" Bourla said in a video address.

Throughout the festivities marking independence day, thousands of people held barbecues, lounged on beaches and celebrated at parties, often without masks.

On Wednesday, Israel announced a plan to allow vaccinated foreign tourists to return in groups beginning May 23, more than a year after closing its borders to most tourists to prevent the spread of the virus.

Israel's easing of restrictions stands in contrast to the occupied West Bank and the blockaded Gaza Strip, where infection rates remain high and vaccinations are low.

MOSCOW -- Russia’s main security agency says it has arrested two Belarusians who it said were preparing a plot to overthrow Belarus’ government and kill authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko.

One of the men arrested, Aleksandr Feduta, was Lukahsenko’s spokesman when he was first elected in 1994, but later joined the opposition. The other, lawyer Yuras Zyankovich, has dual Belarusian-U.S. citizenship.

The Federal Security Service said Saturday that the two have been handed over to Belarus. Russian authorities were alerted to information about the men’s plans by the Belarusian security service, the KGB.

The Russian agency said the two suspects came to Moscow to meet with opposition-minded Belarusian generals, whom they told that “for the successful implementation of their plan, it was necessary to physically eliminate practically the entire top leadership of the republic.""

""They detailed the plan for a military coup, in particular, including the seizure of radio and television centers to broadcast their appeal to the people, blocking the internal troops and riot police units loyal to the current government,” the Russian agency said.

Lukashenko told Belarusian television Saturday that investigators found evidence of foreign involvement in the alleged plot, “most likely the FBI, the CIA.”

After nationwide protests against Lukashenko broke out last year after his disputed election win, he repeatedly blamed Western countries for allegedly plotting his downfall or even preparing for a military intervention.

The protests, some of which attracted as many as 200,000 people, started in August after an election that official results say gave Lukashenko a sixth term in office. Opposition members and even some poll workers said the results were fraudulent.

Security forces then cracked down hard on the demonstrations, arresting more than 34,000 people, many of whom were beaten. Most prominent opposition figures have fled Belarus or have since been jailed.",325,2176,7,48

Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada: China’s Orwellian “social credit system” that records the social and financial behaviour of individuals and corporations across China, using a vast surveillance system, has expanded globally, and is now openly operational at the renowned Haidilao hot pot restaurant, in Western Canada.

Ryan Pan, a manager with Haidilao Hot Pot in Vancouver confirmed that over 60 surveillance cameras have been installed in the restaurant at the request of the Haidilao corporation, as part of the social credit system in China. He said that the Vancouver location has 30 tables with two cameras assigned to each table.

When asked specifically why Haidilao required so many cameras to monitor staff and patrons, Ryan Pan said that the cameras were installed to “punish” staff if they didn’t adhere to corporate standards and to “people track”. Pan also said that the video is sent back to China but declined to say why this was, other than to say the reason for this was “secret.”

Founded in Sichuan, China, the Haidilao opened up at two locations in the Vancouver region, the most recent of which was opened in 2018 in a former Swiss Chalet restaurant in the trendy Kitsilano district of Vancouver. The location is within walking distance of the home rented by Huawei for staff temporarily re-located to Vancouver to assist Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer (CFO) of the telecom giant. Following her arrest and hearing over a provisional US extradition request for fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud in order to circumvent US sanctions against Iran. The Haidilao location is no more than 10 minutes to Meng Wanzhou’s mansion and the Peoples Republic of China Consulate. Haidilao has over 935 locations around the world and more than 36 million VIP members and 60,000 plus staff.

We reached out to Ivy Li, with the Canadian Friends of Hong Kong, who is a well-known public speaker, writer and activist on matters related to China and pro-democracy, to ask why Canadians should be concerned that China’s social credit system is now operational in Canada.

Ivy, who was born and raised in Hong Kong, had this to say in response: “Not only ethnic Chinese Canadians and residents, and businesses with Chinese ties are put at risk, but the privacy and safety of all Canadians and our society are compromised. Customers at a popular ethnic cuisine restaurant, especially in an upscale area, could be diplomats and politicians entertaining their guests, CEOs discussing their business strategies, professionals talking about company projects, journalists conducting interviews, etc., etc. Dinners discuss a wide range of subjects, especially after a couple of wine. The dining table in a popular restaurant is one of the best places to eavesdrop on someone and to get the pulse of a society.”

CHINA’S SOCIAL CREDIT SYSTEM

China’s social credit system was officially rolled out nationwide in 2014 with a plan to build “trust” in the marketplace and broader society. According to a report by USA Congressional Research Service (CRS) in 2020, China’s social credit system has developed into two connected but distinct systems: a system for monitoring individual behaviour, still in early pilot stages, and a more robust system for monitoring corporate behaviour.

The deadline for implementing China’s social credit system was 2020 when it became mandatory for all Chinese citizens to be enrolled in the national database and rated with a “social score” based on different behaviours; these “social scores” are then used to punish or reward. Praise the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on social media and you will be given a higher score, potentially leading to benefits such as priority for school admissions, free gym services, shorter wait times at hospitals and other benefits. Illegally protest against the CCP, forget to pay your utility bill, or knowingly associate with another individual who has a low score, and you might be restricted in accessing public services, excluded from taking transportation, or perhaps your children will be denied entry into the best schools.

A similar model is applied to businesses in China called the Corporate Social Credit System (CSCS) designed to create a single, standardized reputation system for local and foreign firms alike. The system touches on virtually all aspects of a company’s business operations in China by assessing company performance, making sure they pay their taxes, uphold standard of service and other market entities. Based on their rating, Chinese authorities will reward or punish businesses that can result in penalty fees, higher inspection rates and possibly even blacklisting. Companies receiving a high corporate social credit score could result in better tax rate, market access and possibly being placed on what is known as a “redlist”.

That is inside China. What isn’t clear is how China’s social credit system impacts overseas Chinese living in Canada who work for companies with ties to China who are required to be a part of CSCS. Will the behaviours and actions taken by individuals working in Canada for Chinese companies impact the score of relatives or other employees inside China? It’s not inconceivable that a person protesting in Canada about human rights abuses in China, may not be hired by a Chinese owned company because they have been blacklisted by China’s social credit system, even if they live in Canada. What about the impact of China’s social credit system on Canadian employment laws, privacy, and human rights laws?

We know that China has already started to move forward with the creation of an English language corporate social credit system version by Xinhua Credit for non-Chinese firms.

International brands are already punished if they step out of line in and out of China. They must either stay silent or actively support China’s policies if they want future access to the Chinese market. We saw the NBA’s Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted in support of the Hong Kong protests and ultimately was forced to apologize. More recently, the boycott of H&M and other Western brands in China after they spoke out against forced labour in the cotton industry in the Xinjiang region of China. There is already a punishment-based system for corporations that don’t comply with the CCP regime regardless of compliance with China’s CSCS.

HAVE ANY CANADIAN LAWS BEEN BROKEN?

China’s CSCS operating within Canadian borders all boils down to the safety of workers, human rights, privacy of citizenry and national security, all of which is governed by legislation at a municipal, provincial, and federal level. The Canadian government is aware that China has implemented the CSCS and has even issued recommendations on how to conduct business inside China now that it has been implemented. But little to nothing has been done by elected officials to prevent China from implementing the CSCS inside Canada as a way to control foreign workers from China and Chinese owned businesses, or anyone for that matter, who is ethnic Chinese with personal or professional ties to China.

At a municipal (city) level, until recently, commercial security cameras used to be powered from a plug in the wall with a video cable going back to a personal video recorder (PVR). The City of Vancouver would normally require an electrical permit for this kind of set-up which would have, at the very least, alerted city officials in this case, given the large volume of cameras installed. However, the Haidilao cameras appear to be more modern cameras powered over Ethernet (POE). Meaning they are plugged into a network that can send video footage live back to China. They can be installed at any point without a permit. Quite simply, there is nothing stopping the Chinese government from insisting that all businesses in Canada who have ties to China either professionally or personally install a surveillance system as part of China’s social credit system.

British Columbia purports to have strict privacy laws with the Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) governing how an organization can collect, use, or disclose information on individuals. When asked if the Office of the Privacy Commissioner was aware of CSCS sending private footage of temporary foreign workers and Canadian citizens back to China, Michelle Mitchell with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner in BC (unrelated to author), stressed that an important component of PIPA is consent and that an organization must have consent before collecting, using, or disclosing personal information, citing three types of consent under PIPA, which is express consent, implied consent, and opt-out consent.

Since many of the staff at the Haidilao restaurant are Chinese citizens and work under the Temporary Foreign Worker Program in Canada, and are already listed in the Social Credit system in China as citizens of China, they aren’t likely to demand privacy under Canadian law. Even staff members who live in Canada permanently with “permanent resident status” face the same pressure to conform to China’s mandatory CSCS program, because China doesn’t consider individuals with permanent resident status in Canada unless they renounce their Chinese citizenship. “Consent” isn’t an option in totalitarian regimes.

SAFETY OF WORKERS AND PRIVACY OF CITIZENS

We asked the Minister of Labour in British Columbia, Harry Bains, if he was aware that China’s social credit program was active in BC, and if he had any plans to update labour laws to protect employees—both foreign and domestic—to prevent punishment of overseas employees working in BC. The Minister didn’t answer the question at all, choosing instead to have Lisa Beare, the Minister of Citizens’ Services in British Columbia, who is in charge of governing PIPA legislation, respond. Lisa Beare also didn’t respond directly to the question either, instead the Ministry provided a boiler plate response to say that they expect organizations to essentially adhere to the honour system by following current privacy legislation. “The Province expects organizations to follow Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) in regards to the handling of British Columbians’ personal information.” There was no mention by Ms Beare of government plans to update legislation to reflect current privacy concerns around China’s intrusion into the Canadians’ right to privacy.

NATIONAL SECURITY

A more insidious aspect to China’s CSCS is that it can be used to spy on Canadian citizens under the pretence of being a part of China’s social credit program. Canadian authorities may take the approach that CSCS has nothing to do with Canada and our laws. However, the Haidilao hot pot restaurant manager clearly stated that there were two reasons for the surveillance cameras, for both social credit and state security purposes. In all likelihood, next-generation data sources—such as information from facial recognition-driven video feeds, cell phone surveillance and e-com purchase history—are being collected from Canadians while they eat and it wouldn’t be the first time that the CCP has filmed Canadians inside Canada.

Over the past couple of years, an ever-expanding collection of surveillance cameras have been added to the Vancouver PRC Consulate, located in the prestigious Shaughnessy district of Vancouver, on the edge of a high traffic road that goes into the City. The surveillance camera has been installed on the edge of the property, one of which jettisons out into Canadian space, then retracts back. The street is a frequent place for pro-Hong Kong activists, Uyghurs protesting genocide, Iranians protesting the cooperation pact with China and members of Falun Gong protesting persecution. Canada is a multicultural country that has opened its doors to countless refugees fleeing persecution and promotes equality and the right to free speech as a core value. Yet Canada’s elected officials have done little if anything to ensure that the very people we have invited into Canada are promised a safe haven from the oppressive regimes they fled from in the first place.

The cameras used by the PRC consulate are the same cameras that the US banned the purchase and use of under the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) as a cyber security threat.

In 2019, Global Affairs, the department of the Government of Canada that manages Canada’s diplomatic and consular relations, also doesn’t appear to concerned that the Government of China is spying on Canadians with cameras installed on embassy grounds that jettison out into Canadian space, naively suggesting that addressing the matter is left to the Peoples Republic of China and the “honor” system of having a duty to adhere to Canadian laws.

“Diplomatic and consular representatives have a duty to respect local laws, and there is a similar expectation for the manner in which foreign missions operate. In Canada, there is an expectation that foreign missions comply with federal, provincial, and municipal laws and regulations, including those that governs the use of physical security equipment, such as cameras, fences, and lights.”

WHY MAKE IT SO OBVIOUS?

Why install over 60 security cameras in a restaurant if you don’t want customers to ask questions? Restaurant manager Ryan Pan did say that the company had a very strict food safety discipline. The chain suffered an embarrassing public incident at one of its Beijing restaurant s a number of years ago that could be used to justify as an overreaction to installing so many cameras.

However, there is little doubt that Chinese surveillance within Canada can be correlated to the CCP’s need for control of its citizens. By establishing this capability within Canada, through what is believed to be capitalist corporate enterprise, the Chinese are able to identify Canada’s response. The restaurant in this case, with its “over-the-top” large volume of surveillance cameras could actually be a penetration test that measures vulnerability, as well as the reactions Canadian law enforcement and general public display.

Passive responses by Canada’s elected officials, law enforcement, and security intelligence agencies only serve to embolden influence operations, which have historically been the standard by which the Chinese base their tactics. The potential for further technology-based exploitation inside Canada will most assuredly increase.

In a rare public statement made on 9 February 2021, Director David Vigneault of Canada’s Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) had this to say about the threat to Canada’s National Security by the Government of China: “To be clear, the threat does not come from the Chinese people, but rather the Government of China that is pursuing a strategy for geopolitical advantage on all fronts-economic, technical, political, and military-and using all elements of state power to carry out activities that are a direct threat to our national security and sovereignty. We must all strengthen our defenses.”

Despite Canada’s security intelligence agency warning Canadians and elected officials about the threat to Canada’s national security, Canada’s Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, has enjoyed the benefits of a very cozy relationship with China and isn’t likely to implement any significant changes to law that might affect that relationship.

We asked the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) if Prime Minister Trudeau was aware that China’s Corporate Social Credit System is now operational in Canada and if he was aware that Canadian citizens were having their biometric information taken via video surveillance and sent back to China. We also asked, what if anything did he intend to do legislatively to address CSCS in Canada.

The Prime Minister’s Office did not respond by deadline.

Ivy Li said this in response to the Prime Minister of Canada’s apparent lack of concern over China surveillance of Canadian citizens; “What is most chilling as a Canadian is that, knowing the Chinese Communist Party ‘Social Credit System’ is able to operate in Canada openly, yet our governments at all levels have no measures to stop it, to prevent it from replicating across the country, and to protect Canadians from being spied on directly through private companies by a dictatorial regime who is currently committing genocide, forced-labour, on-demand organ harvesting, and crushing the basic rights of Hong Kong citizens. That regime is coming for us. CCP’s social credit system should be made illegal in Canada, and sharing our information live with a foreign regime’s suppressive surveillance system by a private business should be a criminal offence. Official policy must be brough in ASAP to stamp out such practices.”

The ultimate question is: how many companies in Canada have installed surveillance systems at the behest of the CCP for the purpose of fulfilling their obligation to the Corporate Social Credit System? Is this just the start or is the system already well underway? Is Canada prepared to address China’s Social Credit System operating inside Canada from a labour, human rights, privacy, and national security perspective or will Canada’s elected officials just wish it all away and appease the CCP instead of protecting its citizens and living up to best practices under the 5eyes partnership alliance?

Hester McCardell Ford was born Aug. 15, 1905, in Lancaster County, South Carolina, according to the Gerontology Research Group. Some U.S. census records place her birth year as 1904. She became the oldest person in the United States when Alelia Murphy died on Nov. 23, 2019, at the age of 114.

She had lived in the Charlotte area since the 1950s, WSOC-TV reported.

“She was a pillar and stalwart to our family and provided much-needed love, support and understanding to us all,” Ford’s great-granddaughter, Tanisha Patterson-Powe, posted on Facebook. “She was the seed that sprouted leaves and branches which is now our family. God saw fit to make her the matriarch of your family and blessed us to be her caretakers and recipients of her legacy.”

Ford’s father was a farmer in South Carolina. She grew up picking cotton, plowing fields and canning vegetables before moving to Charlotte, WSOC reported.

She was married to John Ford in South Carolina on March 12, 1921. They raised a family in Pleasant Hill, South Carolina, before moving to Charlotte. John Ford died Jan. 10, 1963, in Charlotte, according to vital records.

Hester Ford had 12 children, 48 grandchildren, 108 great-grandchildren, and approximately 120 great-great-grandchildren.

“Although she has passed, her legacy and memory will continue to live on through her family and everyone she has touched to make the world a better place for generations to come,” the family’s Facebook post read. “In closing, we would sincerely like to thank everyone for their support, extended gratitude as we keep her legacy alive. As we pause from our day-to-day activities let us reflect on how far we have come and where we are aspiring to go in the name and legacy of Mother Hester McCardell Ford.”

Ford’s death makes Thelma Sutcliffe, of Nebraska, who was born Oct. 1, 1906, as the nation’s oldest living person, according to the Gerontology Research Group.

Hester Ford was a longtime member of Macedonia Baptist Church. Sept. 1, 2020, was designated as Mother Hester McCardell Ford Day by the Mecklenburg County Board of Commissioners, WSOC reported.

0,China Has Trademarked the Entire South China Sea,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/mark-04132021192429.html,"Satellite image from March 21 shows Scarborough Shoal, one of the features trademarked by the Chinese government.

Not content with claiming sovereignty over nearly every crag of rock and spit of sand in the South China Sea, China has taken the unusual step of registering trademarks over hundreds of land features scattered throughout those disputed waters, an investigation by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service, has found.

That action is meeting with disapproval from other South China Sea claimants. Taiwan and Vietnam have rejected the legitimacy of the trademarks, which experts described as a possible attempt by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to control how domestic and even foreign companies use South China Sea branding.

Unlike most of China’s assertive behavior in the South China Sea, the trademark registrations largely slipped under the radar when they were initiated seven years ago. But now a review of Chinese government records from 2014 by BenarNews has revealed that Sansha City — which is responsible for administering China’s claims in the South China Sea — filed thousands of domestic trademark applications covering 281 specific rocks, reefs, shoals, and other contested features as well as entire regions of the South China Sea.

Each of these trademarks is composed of the feature’s name in stylized Chinese calligraphy and is categorized under one of 45 international trademark classes, which cover everything from musical instruments to legal services. Many also include an English transliteration of the feature’s name and an illustrated logo that offers a colorful view of the feature as seen from above. The depiction of features appears to predate China’s massive campaign of land reclamation in the Paracel and Spratly Islands which kicked off in 2014.

Declaring sovereignty

Julian Ku, a professor at the Maurice A. Deane School of Law at Hofstra University, said these trademarks could potentially help the PRC government wield lawsuits to control how Chinese and foreign companies use South China Sea branding.

He said that this would be a form of “lawfare” — China’s use of domestic and international law to advance its position in the disputes.

China contends that it holds sovereignty over hundreds of features across the entire South China Sea as well as extensive rights to its waters, a position not supported by international law. Its claims are contested by several neighboring countries, though it does not appear that those countries, including Vietnam and the Philippines, have registered comparable trademarks.

In response to a request for comment on China’s trademarks, an official at the Vietnamese Embassy in Washington, D.C. told BenarNews that “every way to spread information that is against international law and historical truth is valueless and unlawful, as well as will not be able to change the truth about Viet Nam’s sovereignty over Hoang Sa [Paracels] and Truong Sa [Spratlys].”

The commercial use of South China Sea imagery — particularly maps — has long been a source of tension between the rival claimants. The inclusion of China’s controversial nine-dash line on a map in DreamWorks’ 2019 film Abominable, for example, caused authorities in the Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia to ban the film.

And just last week, Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Le Thi Thu Hang said that “companies operating in Vietnam must respect and strictly comply with the laws of Vietnam,” criticizing foreign brands that include China’s nine-dash line in maps on their products.

It is clear from official commentary on the issue that China sees intrinsic value in asserting commercial rights over what are disputed territories. Quoting a Sansha City official, state-run China Industry and Commerce News reported in 2016 that “applying to register trademarks for the names of Sansha City’s islands and reefs in accordance with China’s ‘Trademark Law’ was the most direct embodiment of declaring sovereignty.”

Sansha City also registered these trademarks to “protect the geographical name ownership of each island, reef, shoal, and island” and “prevent trademark squatting,” China Industry and Commerce News said, referring to when one entity preemptively registers another entity’s trademark, effectively stealing it.

Claiming every last rock and reef

The 281 features trademarked by Sansha City largely match the list of 287 features that China named and claimed in 1983, which was expanded in April 2020.

For example, the city trademarked the Paracel Islands, an archipelago also claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan; the Crescent Group and Amphitrite Group, which form the two main halves of the Paracel Islands; the Qilian Islets, which is a sub-region within the Amphitrite Group; and Tree Island, which is part of the Qilian Islets.

It trademarked numerous rocks and reefs in the Spratly Islands too, including features controlled by other claimant states like Taiwan-occupied Itu Aba, Philippines-occupied Thitu Island, and Vietnam-occupied Sin Cowe Island.

Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council said this week that it has unquestionable sovereignty over Itu Aba as well as long-term effective governance over the island. The council said that China’s trademarks are inconsistent with international standards and criticized them as a deliberate attempt to create a false image of Chinese jurisdiction over Itu Aba.

Tensions between Taiwan and the PRC over their competing South China Sea claims have been increasingly high in recent weeks as China has operated drones and military aircraft near Taiwan-occupied Pratas Island.

Sansha City has not in fact registered a trademark for Pratas, but it has for other disputed features that have lately been in the news. Among them are Scarborough Shoal and Whitsun Reef — each the location of a standoff between China and the Philippines, the first at Scarborough in 2012 and the second at Whitsun in March 2021.

The presence of hundreds of Chinese fishing or militia vessels at Whitsun Reef generated significant diplomatic pushback from Manila in late March and on Tuesday prompted Manila to summon China’s ambassador to the Philippines. It has also drawn statements of concern and condemnation from Washington, Hanoi, Canberra, London, and other capitals.

Authorities in the Philippines did say last week that they are aware of China’s trademarks but they declined to comment. Malaysian officials also declined to comment.

Questionable legal strength

Chinese government records show that Sansha City has applied for at least 2,675 trademarks, with all but a handful of applications submitted in 2014. Most but not all of these applications appear to have been successfully approved.

In 82 instances, Sansha City trademarked a feature more than once, sometimes filing trademarks under each of the 45 international trademark classes for a single feature. It also trademarked Scarborough Shoal under two separate names, submitting 45 trademark applications for “Huangyan Island” and 45 for “Minzhu Reef.”

Despite China registering the trademarks seven years ago, they do not appear to have been used widely – with one exception. The “Sansha” logo that the city trademarked can be spotted on the city’s supply ships, its website, and podiums used by the municipal government. “Sansha” refers to the Xisha Islands, Nansha Islands, and Zhongsha Islands, which are China’s names for the Paracels, Spratlys, Scarborough Shoal, and Macclesfield Bank.

Ku said the legal implications of these trademarks are not entirely clear.

“Trademarks are legal protections for the use of names or logos for commercial purposes,” which means that “trademarks would not generally be understood to bolster a country’s sovereignty claims under international law,” he said.

Moreover, Ku said that “trademarks are generally recognized first under domestic law and you have to register for a trademark country-by-country” and “each country still has the right to reject the trademark registration for domestic legal reasons.”

Ku also questioned whether such geographical locations can even be trademarked.

“There are protections in U.S. and in international law for geographical indications when associated with (typically) food products such as ‘Champagne’ but trademarking the land feature without any particular product is new to me and I think somewhat uncertain under most countries’ trademark laws,” he said.

Despite these limitations, these trademarks could still be useful for the Chinese government.

For example, these trademarks may have allowed the Chinese government to block unapproved commercial use of South China Sea branding by Chinese companies.

Ku said that these trademarks could also be intended to deter foreign companies from using South China Sea branding.

He said “if any company tried to market a product with a land feature name associated with it, in theory, a Chinese trademark holder would be able to sue.”

“But since I think it is unlikely that other countries would recognize these trademark claims by China, I am not as worried,” Ku said.

He also noted that the Chinese government only trademarked the Chinese names of these features — as well as English transliterations — rather than their widely recognized names in other languages, likely further limiting the international impact of these trademarks.

“Still, even the potential of harassing litigation could be a meaningful deterrent,” Ku said.

0,Rebel groups see opportunity in post-coup Myanmar,https://southeastasiaglobe.com/rebel-groups-post-coup-myanmar/,"Myanmar’s coup has opened an unexpected window of opportunity for the various ethnic rebel outfits, which have no loyalty to either the junta or to deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi, but could together pose a threat to the army’s rule.

The country has been in turmoil since the military ousted Suu Kyi in February, crushing a 10-year experiment with democracy that had been enthusiastically embraced by the dominant Bamar ethnicity.

But for many ethnic minorities, her administration was more foe than friend.

While each ethnic armed group has its own demands, all want a version of federalism, giving them at least some measure of self-governance.

Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy (NLD) once offered them that in exchange for electoral support.

“The Bamar majority have given such a promise from time to time, without it materialising,” Khu Oo Reh of the Karenni National Progressive Party (KNPP), told AFP.

“It was just words.”

Despite their deep-seated distrust of the NLD, several groups have condemned the putsch and the junta’s use of violence — including killing more than 700 civilians — to quell the subsequent uprising.

At least three groups in Myanmar’s east, including the KNPP, are sheltering thousands of anti-junta dissidents.

The anti-coup movement is now watching closely to see if the rebels will harden their opposition against the junta.

Thant Myint-U, author of “The Hidden History of Burma”, said the current moment could prove an opportunity for these groups to press for federalism.

“Their actions over these coming months may have an outsize impact in what’s still an incredibly fluid situation,” the historian told AFP.

“The seven-to-eight most powerful ethnic armed organisations now hold greater sway over Myanmar’s future than any time since independence.”

‘World’s longest civil war’

The end of British colonial rule in 1948 left a complex patchwork of cultural, ethnic and linguistic groups awkwardly sharing the new state of Myanmar.

A messy struggle over autonomy, control of lucrative drug production and natural resources has pitted more than 20 different groups against each other — among them the Bamar-majority military.

The multi-faceted conflict has spanned seven decades, and been described as the world’s longest-running civil war.

The military — which has never been under civilian rule — sought to dampen the conflicts with strategic ceasefires, effectively reaching a detente with some of the rebel groups.

But in the wake of the coup, those ceasefires have begun to fray.

The powerful Ta’ang National Liberation Association (TNLA) and two allied groups have said they were abandoning their truce, accusing the junta of war crimes.

“They must apologise to the ethnic minorities for what the previous government has done”

That condemnation has raised protesters’ hopes that the militias would unite to take up arms against the junta, forming a so-called “federal army”.

The potential for spiralling conflict has prompted observers like U.N. special envoy for Myanmar Christine Schraner Burgener to warn that “a bloodbath is imminent.”

The idea of mounting organised self-defence was first proposed by the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH), a group of lawmakers mostly from the NLD who are attempting to represent the elected government.

They have also unveiled a “Federal Democracy Charter”, which features a governing role for ethnic armed groups.

The TNLA and other northern groups — some of whom have ties with Beijing — have so far remained silent on the CRPH’s overtures for unity.

Groups in the east of the country are also lukewarm.

General Yawd Serk, leader of the Restoration Council for Shan State (RCSS) — one of the country’s most powerful groups — called it a “positive move”, but stopped short of support.

“We are observing each other but we are not fully with (CRPH),” he told AFP.

Complicating the idea of a federal army is shifting loyalties between rebels; the RCSS, for example, is currently locked in conflict with two other Shan state organisations.

The various rebel groups also lack the fire and manpower of Myanmar’s military, a modern army equipped with fighter jets and armoured vehicles.

‘Our common enemy’

A humanitarian crisis is already brewing in neighbouring Karen state, where the military has carried out air strikes on towns held by the Karen National Union (KNU).

About 24,000 people were displaced by the bombings, said the KNU, with thousands crossing the border briefly into Thailand.

The KNU is sheltering around 2,000 dissidents who have fled urban hotspots.

One activist who stayed in their territory said the distrust of CRPH — and the ethnic Bamar majority in general — is high, even if the rebels are outraged over the coup.

“They must apologise to the ethnic minorities for what the previous government has done,” said the activist, declining to be named.

“That’s the very first step by which they can gain trust.”

KNU’s head of foreign affairs Padoh Saw Taw Nee said the group is “cautiously optimistic” about the CRPH’s promise for federalism.

“We just have to work together with them,” he told AFP.

“There are lots of obstacles but we are trying to find a way to overthrow our common enemy.”

0,U.S. and China agree to take joint climate action,https://www.axios.com/us-china-agree-joint-climate-action-838a35b5-92a8-47c6-901f-1a7e9926f5bc.html,"Despite an increasingly tense relationship, the U.S. and China agreed Saturday to work together to tackle global climate change, including by ""raising ambition"" for emissions cuts during the 2020s — a key goal of the Biden administration.

Why it matters: The joint communique released Saturday evening commits the world's two largest emitters of greenhouse gases to work together to keep the most ambitious temperature target contained in the Paris Climate Agreement viable by potentially taking additional emissions cuts prior to 2030.

In addition, the document leaves open the possibility that the U.S. and China can act jointly on climate change while having strong disagreements on trade, technology, and national security issues, though how far this cooperation can extend remains to be seen.

Details: Ahead of negotiations in Shanghai between John Kerry, President Biden's special envoy for climate, and Xie Zhenhua, his Chinese counterpart, the State Department had worked to downplay expectations.

In fact, the participation of Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the White House's virtual climate summit on April 22-23 has been in doubt.

But the document indicates China will participate in the summit, stating: ""Both countries look forward to the US-hosted Leaders Summit on Climate on April 22/23. They share the Summit’s goal of raising global climate ambition on mitigation, adaptation...""

In addition, the document calls for both countries to move away from funding fossil fuel energy sources, and toward clean energy.

Yes, but: The document is lacking in specifics, including any new emissions targets from either country.

Driving the news: China is by far the world's top current emitter of greenhouse gases, while the U.S. is the second-largest emitter. However, when viewed historically, the U.S. is the top contributor to global warming.

The problem cannot be solved without the participation of these two countries, and they're at loggerheads over a host of other issues.

The big picture: Meanwhile, the world is well off track to meeting the goals of the Paris agreement, which calls for keeping global warming to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and trying to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or. 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, relative to the preindustrial era.

Warming beyond these levels raises the odds of potentially catastrophic impacts, scientists warn.

Currently, the world is on track to warm by more than 3 degrees Celsius, or 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit, by 2100.

In order to meet the Paris targets, studies show, the world must begin slashing emissions prior to 2030.

Of note: China is a major user of coal-fired power plants, and there have been concerns that it has been taking a fossil fuel intensive approach to its Belt and Road Initiative involving many developing nations.

What they're saying: Alden Meyer, a senior associate with the climate think tank E3G, told Axios that the joint statement ""seems generally very positive,"" but also notes many details remain to be worked out.

""It's probably a very negotiated text, but it committed China in a sense to taking actions in the 2020s, which is the question people have been having since President Xi’s [2060] net-zero commitment last September — what will China do to accelerate action in this decade toward that net-zero goal,"" he said.

Li Shuo, policy officer with Greenpeace East Asia, told Axios that the joint statement ""highlights the unequivocal commitment of both the US and China to work together in addressing the climate crisis. It is a firm step towards cooperation amid great geopolitical challenges.

""The difficult meetings in Shanghai bore fruit. Let that move the politics closer to where science requires us to be.""

Catch up fast: Prior to the successful negotiation of the Paris Agreement in 2015, the U.S. struck a bilateral agreement with China to address emissions, paving the way for a more united front at the actual summit.

To date, China has pledged to cut carbon emissions per unit of economic output by over 65% by 2030 and boost the share of nonfossil fuels in energy consumption to roughly 25% by then.

It also aims to be carbon-neutral by 2060 and have its emissions peak before 2030.

The intrigue: Kerry's visit, and the participation of Xie, who had been his counterpart in 2015 as well, demonstrated that the U.S. was trying to return to that formula.

Context: Much has changed since Paris was signed.

Global emissions have gone up, and the effects of climate change have become more obvious in the form of massive wildfires in the U.S. and Australia, melting glaciers and heat waves. And under President Trump, the U.S. abandoned the Paris agreement, only to rejoin it under Biden.

What to watch: While the communique mentions cooperation in several key technological areas of clean energy, a big question is whether China will offer a firm commitment to a pre-2030 emissions reduction target at the White House summit.

It will be Biden’s second opportunity to sit in person with a foreign counterpart since he took office during the coronavirus pandemic. It will follow face-to-face meetings Biden has scheduled for Friday with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said a date for Moon’s visit would be announced later.

Biden’s meeting with his South Korean counterpart follows recent visits to Seoul by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, and a three-way meeting in April in Annapolis, Maryland, among the national security advisers from the United States, Japan and South Korea.

A man identified by police as Brandon Hole, 19, opened fire outside a FedEx warehouse facility in Indianapolis late Thursday night before moving inside the facility, killing eight people and injuring several others. Hole is believed to have shot himself and is among the nine dead, according to police.

""FedEx officials have confirmed that Mr. Hole was an employee at the facility and that he was last employed in 2020,"" Indianapolis Deputy Police Chief Craig McCartt said.

Friday evening, police released the names of those who were killed. They have been identified as Matthew R. Alexander,32, Samaria Blackwell, 19, Amarjeet Johal, 66, Jaswinder Kaur, 64, Jaswinder Singh, 68, Amarjit Sekhon, 48, Karlie Smith, 19, and John Weisert, 74.

The Sikh Coalition said four of the victims were Sikh and described the facility as ""known to be heavily populated by Sikh employees."" The group estimates that 8,000-10,000 Sikhs live in Indiana.

McCartt said, ""This suspect came to this facility, got out of his car and quickly began some random shooting.""

McCartt said investigators are trying to determine the motive.

Federal Bureau of Investigation Indianapolis Special Agent in Charge Paul Keenan said the suspect's mother had reached out to law enforcement last March, warning that her son may attempt ""suicide by cop.""

""The suspect was placed on an immediate detention mental health temporary hold by the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department. A shotgun was seized at his residence. Based on items observed in the suspect's bedroom at that time, he was interviewed by the FBI in April 2020,"" Keenan said. ""No Racially Motivated Violent Extremism (RMVE) ideology was identified during the course of the assessment and no criminal violation was found. The shotgun was not returned to the suspect.""

McCartt said Hole killed four individuals outside and then entered the facility ""for a brief period of time,"" killing four others and then taking his own life.

Four people who suffered gunshot wounds were treated in local hospitals, and a fifth person with an injury that was not firearms-related was also treated, he said.

McCartt said the shooting lasted ""just a few minutes"" and that by the time officers arrived on the scene, it was over.

The FedEx Ground-Plainfield Operation Center warehouse at 8951 Mirabel Road is about five miles from Indianapolis International Airport.

In a statement to NPR, FedEx said it was ""deeply shocked and saddened by the loss of our team members following the tragic shooting at our FedEx Ground facility in Indianapolis.""

""Our most heartfelt sympathies are with all those affected by this senseless act of violence. The safety of our team members is our top priority, and we are fully cooperating with investigating authorities,"" the statement said.

Police said it's unclear how many workers were on duty at the time of the shooting.

A witness said he was working inside the building when he heard a series of rapid gunshots.

""I see a man come out with a rifle in his hand and he starts firing and he starts yellin' stuff that I could not understand,"" Levi Miller told WTHR-TV. ""What I ended up doing was ducking down to make sure he did not see me because I thought he would see me and he would shoot me.""

Jeremiah Miller, who was about to start the second half of a double shift at the FedEx facility when the shooting took place, told WISH-TV that he and a co-worker, Timothy Boillat, heard up to 10 shots.

Miller said he saw a man with what he described as ""a submachine gun of some sort, an automatic rifle.""

Boillat told the TV station that he ""didn't exactly see a person get shot but, after hearing the shooting, I did see a body on the floor behind a vehicle.""

""Luckily, I was far enough away where he (the shooter) didn't notice me or see me. So, thank God for that,"" he said.

The incident is the third mass shooting in Indianapolis this year. Five people were killed in a January shooting, and three adults and a child were killed in an incident in March.

Indianapolis Mayor Joseph Hogsett said the city was ""confronted with the horrific news of yet another mass shooting, an act of violence that senselessly claimed the lives of eight of our neighbors.""

Hogsett, a Democrat, recently signed onto a letter with more than 150 mayors around the country asking the U.S. Senate to take up legislation to expand background checks required when firearms are transferred between private citizens and other gun-related measures.

We wake up once more to news of a mass shooting, this time in Indiana. No country should accept this now-routine horror. It’s long past time to act. — Secretary Pete Buttigieg (@SecretaryPete) April 16, 2021

President Biden, Vice President Harris and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a former mayor of South Bend, Ind., also weighed in on the shooting.

""Last night and into the morning in Indianapolis, yet again families had to wait to hear word about the fate of their loved ones,"" the president said. ""What a cruel wait and fate that has become too normal and happens every day somewhere in our nation.""

""Gun violence is an epidemic in America. But we should not accept it. We must act,"" he added.

Harris said there is ""no question this violence must end.""

In a tweet, Buttigieg said: ""No country should accept this now-routine horror. It's long past time to act.""",948,5689,8,49
0,Iran produces first batch of 60% enriched uranium,https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2021/04/16/649598/Iran-says-it-produced-first-batch-of-60-percent-enriched-uranium-products,"Iran’s scientists have managed to produce the country’s first batch of 60-percent enriched uranium in Natanz days after a nuclear facility came under a terrorist attack, top officials say.

""60-percent enrichment is currently underway at the Shahid Ahmadi Roshan nuclear facility"" in Natanz, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran Ali Akbar Salehi said Friday.

Salehi said any level of enrichment is now possible for Iran, adding despite the recent sabotage, enrichment continues at the Natanz facility.

He said the 60-percent enrichment was completed in two days. “Production of 60-percent enriched uranium is currently 9 grams per hour,” Salehi said.

The 20-percent enrichment which was already underway at the facility continues in parallel with the 60-percent enrichment, he said, adding ""the Natanz site is still standing and moving forward vigorously"".

""One of the deterrents is the readiness of our devout youth who immediately fix up the problem whenever the enemy creates an accident and move a few steps forward as well,” Salehi said.

The announcement came days after Iran informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of a plan to start 60-percent uranium enrichment, following what Iran called “nuclear terrorism” against Natanz.

“I am proud to announce that at 00:40 last night ... young and pious Iranian scientists were able to obtain a 60% enriched uranium product,” Parliament speaker Mohammad-Baqer Qalibaf wrote in a Persian tweet on Friday.

""We congratulate the brave people of the Islamic Iran on this success; the will of the Iranian people is miraculous and will thwart any conspiracy,"" he added.

The 60-percent uranium is used to make a variety of radiopharmaceuticals, which are hard to come by amid the most aggressive US sanctions ever on Iran.

Salehi said enrichment to 60-percent purity level has different applications, one of which for the production of radiopharmaceuticals.

The production is possible with 20-percent enrichement, but ""as the richness increases, our efficiency increases and the amount of molybdenum also increases, while the production time becomes shorter and the process easier"", he added.

Molybdenum has many civilian uses including in medical imaging. It is also used as a catalyst in the refining of petroleum and an alloying agent in steel.

The act of sabotage came a day after Iran began feeding gas to cascades of new, advanced centrifuges and unveiled 133 achievements to mark its national nuclear technology day.

Iranian officials have said while the aim of the attack was apparently to limit Iran's nuclear capability, all the centrifuges that went out of order due to the incident were of the IR1 type that are being replaced with more advanced ones.

On Saturday, an order was given to feed gas to 164 all-Iranian IR6 centrifuges, with 10 SWU – separative work units that indicate the amount of separation done by an enrichment process.

The IR6 is the most sustainably efficient centrifuge Iran currently deploys, which will be mass-produced on an industrial level. The machine is able to produce 10 times more uranium hexafluoride (UF6) than IR1, Iran’s first-generation centrifuges.

Presiden Hassan Rouhani also gave the order to begin feeding gas to test a number of 30 IR5 centrifuges and 30 IR6s centrifuges, numbers that could grow if they are successful.

Moreover, mechanical tests began on the top-of-the-line IR9 centrifuge that has a separative capacity of 50 SWU.

Also in Natanz, a unit to assemble and evaluate advanced centrifuges was launched, where Iranian experts said more than half of all operations are currently industrialized.

Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has said the perpetrators of the sabotage are wrong to think the act will undermine Iran’s position in Vienna negotiations which are held with the aim of lifting US sanctions on the Islamic Republic.

“Incidentally, this cowardly act will strengthen our position in the negotiations,” Zarif said on Monday.

Both the US and the Europeans have kept silent on the attack, and expressed concerns over Iran's 60-percent enrichment, instead. The Europeans are one of the interlocutors in the Vienna talks - while the US is not because it is no longer a party to the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.

In a surprise move, the European Union on Monday imposed sanctions on eight Iranians, including head of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), raising the ante in hostile measures against Tehran.

Iran's chief negotiator Abbas Araqchi told Press TV on Thursday that the EU sanctions are meant to undermine the negotiations.

“The Europeans not only ignored this important act of sabotage, but also they were busy imposing new sanctions on Iran and that was totally unacceptable,” he said in Vienna.

Araqchi said participants at a Thursday session had “very tough exchanges of views”, but they all agreed to move forward.

“They have to lift all sanctions and we need the list of sanctions and this should be our job in this round of discussion,” he said of the US sanctions on Iran, asserting that without a list, “I don’t think we can make any progress.”

The list should also include the third parties which have been sanctioned because of their cooperation with Iran, Araqchi said.

“Before we see the list, we cannot judge whether it is as complete as we want or not.”

On Wednesday, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei warned against ""attritive negotiations"", saying protracted talks are harmful to Iran.",884,5517,8,49
0,Myanmar army shoots at protesting medical workers,https://asiatimes.com/2021/04/myanmar-army-shoots-at-protesting-medical-workers/,"Myanmar’s military opened fire on protesting healthcare workers on Thursday, killing at least one bystander as the demonstrators fled for safety to a nearby mosque.

The country has been in an uproar since the military seized power from civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi on February 1, triggering a massive uprising that the junta has sought to quell using lethal force.

But the movement remains undeterred, and protesters have continued taking to the streets this week – refusing to celebrate the Myanmar New Year holiday of Thingyan.

On Thursday in Myanmar’s second-largest city of Mandalay, a demonstration by medical workers turned violent when soldiers opened fire on them, sending them running to the mosque.

“They were shooting everywhere … they were targeting the Sule mosque compound because people in there were hiding protesters,” said an eyewitness.

A 30-year-old man who lived in the compound was shot dead, and at least two others were injured, said a doctor who treated the wounded.

“The man who died was shot from the back and it penetrated through his chest,” he said.

A medic who participated in the protest said he saw the arrest of six nurses and doctors during the crackdown.

“We lost contact with some medical team members as well,” he said.

Myanmar’s healthcare workers have been at the forefront of a nationwide civil disobedience movement, refusing to return to work under a military regime – which has left the country’s hospitals unstaffed during a pandemic.

Civil servants from other sectors have followed suit, bringing the operation of the country’s banks, schools, railway operations and businesses to a halt.

The junta has tried to force people back to work, and on Thursday, state-run media reported that at least 20 doctors participating in the movement will be charged for attempting to “deteriorate peace and stability.”

So far more than 700 civilians have been killed in anti-coup unrest, according to a local monitoring group, and more than 3,000 have been detained.

A well-known protest leader was arrested Thursday in central Monywa city – he was leading a demonstration by motorbike when a car rammed into him.

“Wai Moe Naing was arrested … I saw his motorcycle hit by the car from afar,” said fellow activist Hein Zaw Win.

The leader had grown in prominence since the coup, shepherding the movement in the remote Sagaing region despite multiple lethal crackdowns from authorities.

0,Russian Security Service Detains Ukraine Diplomat.,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/04/17/russian-security-service-detains-ukraine-diplomat-a73632,"Russia on Saturday said it would expel a Ukrainian diplomat, prompting an immediate pledge of retaliation from Kiev, further escalating tensions over Moscow's troop build-up on Ukraine's eastern flank.

The detention of a Ukrainian consul in the second city St. Petersburg comes at a time of global concern of a repeat of Moscow's 2014 aggression, when Russia annexed the peninsula of Crimea and backed separatists in Ukraine's east.

Moscow claimed the Ukrainian diplomat had been caught ""red-handed"" trying to obtain sensitive information.

In response, the Ukrainian foreign ministry protested ""the illegal"" detention of its diplomat and said Kiev would expel a senior Russian diplomat.

Kiev has been battling Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine since 2014 and clashes intensified early this year, effectively shredding a ceasefire agreed last July.

Around 30 Ukrainian troops have been killed since the start of the year, compared to 50 last year. Most of them were victims of sniper fire.

Russia has detained a number of Ukrainian nationals on suspicion of spying in recent years but the arrest of a diplomat is rare.

""A Ukrainian diplomat, a consul of Ukraine's Consulate General in St. Petersburg, Alexander Sosonyuk, has been detained by Russia's FSB,"" the security service said in a statement, using the Russian language spelling of his name.

He was held on Friday, the security service said. Kiev said the diplomat had spent several hours in detention.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said Saturday it had summoned Ukraine's charge d'affaires Vasyl Pokotylo and told him that the Ukrainian diplomat had 72 hours to leave the country ""beginning April 19.""

""The Russian side pointed to the inadmissibility of such kind of activity,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

Russia's domestic intelligence agency said Sosonyuk had been caught ""red-handed"" during a meeting with a Russian national as he sought to receive ""classified"" information.

""Such activity is not compatible with his diplomatic status and is clearly hostile in nature towards the Russian Federation,"" the FSB said.

""In conformity with international law, measures will be taken against the foreign diplomat.""

'Crude violations'

In Kiev, the Ukrainian foreign ministry said it protested the diplomat's detention and rejected Russia's accusations.

Foreign ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said Russia had ""crudely"" violated diplomatic conventions and sought to escalate tensions.

""In response to the above-mentioned provocation, a senior diplomat of the Russian Embassy in Kiev must leave Ukrainian territory within 72 hours beginning April 19,"" Nikolenko told AFP. He did not provide further details.

Faced with the largest deployment of Russian troops on Ukraine's borders since 2014, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has requested more help from the West, and Western leaders have urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop intimidating Ukraine.

Tensions between Russia and Ukraine come against the background of a new war of words between Moscow and Washington as new U.S. President Joe Biden seeks a tougher line against Putin.

The U.S. on Thursday announced sanctions and the expulsion of 10 Russian diplomats in retaliation for what the White House says is the Kremlin's U.S. election interference, a massive cyber attack and other hostile activity.

Russia said Friday it would expel U.S. diplomats and sanction U.S. officials in response while recommending the U.S. envoy leave Russia ""for consultations.""",534,3517,6,50
0,"Beijing warns US, Japan against collusion vs China",https://news.yahoo.com/beijing-warns-us-japan-against-092813433.html,"BEIJING (AP) — China said Friday it has expressed “serious concerns” to the United States and Japan over what it calls negative moves and collusion between the two countries against China.

The statement from Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian came just before President Joe Biden welcomes Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to the White House on Friday in his first face-to-face meeting with a foreign leader.

That meeting is seen as reflecting Biden’s emphasis on strengthening alliances to deal with a more assertive China and other global challenges.

Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing that Japan and the United States should “take China’s concerns and demands seriously, avoid words and actions that interfere in China’s internal affairs and harm China’s interests.”

“China has no objection to the development of normal bilateral relations between Japan and the United States, but such relations should help enhance mutual understanding and trust among regional countries and contribute to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, and should not target or harm the interests of third parties,"" Zhao said.

China would “make necessary responses as appropriate,"" he said.

Biden and Suga see their meeting as a chance to counter messaging from Chinese President Xi Jinping that America and democracies in general are on the decline, after the political turmoil and backing away from global leadership that marked Donald Trump’s presidency.

Japan remains China's traditional rival dating from Tokyo's brutal WWII occupation of much of the country. Relations between Washington and Beijing are tenser than ever over trade, technology, Hong Kong, Taiwan and human rights, particularly China's policies toward Turkic Muslims in the northwestern region of Xinjiang.

U.S. and Chinese naval movements in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea, which China claims virtually in its entirety, have added to tensions in recent days, following statements from U.S. officials that Beijing may be accelerating its schedule to annex Taiwan by force.

The Biden administration says the primary challenge for the United States lies in managing U.S. policies toward the Indo-Pacific, the main theater in which China is flexing its growing economic and military power. That helped guide Biden’s decision, announced this week, to pull U.S. troops out of Afghanistan and free the administration to focus more on East Asia.",374,2431,8,50

0,Russia’s Sputnik vaccine injects divisions into EU,https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-sputnik-coronavirus-vaccine-divisions-eu/,"Russia's Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine is dividing Europe — sometimes even before a single dose has been delivered.

The Russian jab hasn't yet been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) — where it's currently under rolling review — and the European Commission says the bloc won't need it. It's also not clear whether it will arrive in time to make a difference in some countries. But that hasn't stopped a number of governments breaking away from the EU's common approach to cut their own deals.

Sputnik claimed its biggest prize to date last week, when Germany, thus far a champion of the EU's common approach, said it would begin talks to secure supplies of the vaccine. The German move follows in the footsteps of Hungary and Slovakia, which have both ordered doses. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, meanwhile, said he concluded talks this past weekend to buy 1 million doses.

Other European governments, by contrast, have steered clear. Russia's critics say Moscow is deliberately using the vaccine to sow division. They give short shrift to the insistence of Sputnik's backers that the vaccine has nothing to do with geopolitics. Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Šimonytė described Sputnik V in a tweet as a ""hybrid weapon to divide and rule.""

The jab is also causing divisions even within European governments. Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is keen to use the Russian vaccine — and is apparently committed enough that his government sacked its health and foreign ministers in recent days due to their opposition to Sputnik.

The European outreach for the vaccine comes even as EU politicians sound the alarm over Moscow's actions in other domains — such as a build-up of troops on the Ukrainian border — and its treatment of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, whose health is reportedly deteriorating rapidly in prison.

Information security experts, meanwhile, warn that Moscow is leveraging Sputnik to advance Russia's broader aims in tandem with a sophisticated media campaign.

Some European politicians say the decision by Germany in particular to hold talks on buying Sputnik risks inflicting major damage to European unity. German Green MEP Viola von Cramon-Taubadel, who has criticized the vaccine in the past, described Germany's move as a “geopolitical disaster” that the Kremlin is leveraging to amplify divisions throughout the bloc.

“It's really disturbing that German politicians are obviously naive enough not to understand what's going on,” said von Cramon-Taubadel, who sits on the European Parliament's foreign affairs committee. She described negotiations with a major European power like Germany as a propaganda coup for Russian President Vladimir Putin that would be broadcast ""all over the Russian public and state TV broadcasts.""

Irreconcilable differences

The Sputnik team has fought back, repeatedly denying that their motivation is anything other than stopping the pandemic. In a January interview with POLITICO, Kirill Dmitriev — the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund , the sovereign wealth fund that promotes the shot abroad — complained about politicization of the vaccine.

""Russians created a good vaccine, and they want to protect their own people and play some part in the rest of the world’s [response],"" Dmitriev said at the time. ""That this creates so much political commotion shows the sad state of political affairs.""

In response to a request for comment for this article, a spokesman for RDIF drew attention to a tweet from the Sputnik account that read: “Politicization of vaccines is unethical and costing lives.” RDIF said that “the media should strive to help the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, not to hamper this fight with false allegations.”

Sputnik’s global rollout gained more momentum on Monday after India’s drug regulator authorized the use of the shot in the country. RDIF said that it aimed to produce over 850 million doses of the vaccine a year in India after having closed tie-ups with a number of major local manufacturers.

Meanwhile, controversy over the jab has already claimed political casualties in Europe, as seen in the turmoil in the Czech Republic. Even more spectacularly, the Slovakian government collapsed in March over the decision of then-Prime Minister Igor Matovič to unilaterally buy 2 million doses of Sputnik V.

The crisis continued even after Matovič stepped down and took the position of finance minister. The national drug regulator refused to validate the batches of the Russian vaccine sent to the country on grounds that the doses were different from the vaccine validated in a Phase 3 study published in the Lancet medical journal.

The refusal enraged Matovič, who last Thursday flew to Moscow to discuss the situation with RDIF. In an extraordinary move, he then announced that Slovakia would side-step its own national drug regulator and instead rely on a Hungarian laboratory to perform the required checks.

Clashes over Sputnik aren't limited to Central and Eastern Europe, however, as politicians across the Continent are under severe pressure to tackle a sluggish and widely criticized vaccination effort. The latest blow to that effort came on Tuesday, when Johnson & Johnson said it would “proactively delay” the rollout of its coronavirus vaccine in Europe, citing blood clotting concerns in the U.S.



The Russian vaccine has also provided the pretext for a spate of attempts by regional governments to forge their own side deals, breaking away from national plans.

In Spain, the region of Madrid, led by conservative president Isabel Díaz Ayuso, attempted to obtain Sputnik doses in what amounted to a challenge to the Socialist-led national government. And in Germany, Bavaria actually moved ahead of Berlin, announcing an order earlier on the same day. State Premier Markus Söder told journalists that Bavaria would sign a provisional agreement to buy 2.5 million doses.

Meanwhile, in France, Renaud Muselier, president of the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region, tweeted on Wednesday that it will receive half a million doses of Sputnik. In Italy, the president of the Campania region, Vincenzo De Luca, has entered into a collision course with the national government over his decision to sign a deal for a reported half a million doses. In all of these cases, though, EMA approval is cited as necessary.

German pressure

In Germany's case, it's not clear whether Sputnik doses will arrive in time to make a difference, especially since Health Minister Jens Spahn has insisted that any purchase will require the EMA's all-clear. Given that two other vaccines, Novavax and CureVac, started their rolling review before Sputnik, and that the EMA still has to conduct a check of the vaccine's Russian facilities, it’s possible that the shot will only be approved once most or nearly all Europeans have already been vaccinated.

This is the line taken by EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton, who has said that the bloc had “absolutely no need” for Sputnik. He reiterated those remarks last Friday, stating that ""Sputnik V is simply too late for our goal of vaccinating as many Europeans as possible in the summer.""

This possibility has been acknowledged by Spahn, who recently said on German radio that to make a difference, the delivery would have to arrive in the next two to five months, “otherwise, we have more than enough vaccine anyway.”

But German politicians are under particularly heavy pressure to find ways — however much of a long shot they may be — to boost the vaccine rollout in an election year. Germany has continued to struggle with stubbornly high infection numbers, forcing the government into embarrassing and unpopular lockdown decisions.

Katrin Boettger, a director at the Berlin-based Institute for European Politics think tank, said the move is one way to garner some positive attention amid endless cycles of bad news for the health ministry — although it's not the only motivation.

""It's the case that the public is very critical about the low level of vaccinations that have taken place in Germany at the moment,"" Boettger noted. But she also pointed to a practical reason for trying to secure Sputnik jabs: More than one vaccine-maker has had to revise their deliveries, sometimes dramatically, downwards since the EU began its vaccination campaign. Despite the European Commission's best assurances, many countries may well miss their late-summer coverage target.

""I think that they're just trying to cover their bases a little bit,"" Boettger said.

German MEP Peter Liese, health spokesperson of the center-right European People's Party, said he had been skeptical of the vaccine, but now believes the EMA will approve Sputnik.

""If we have a vaccine that's approved by the EMA, and we say a European agency says it's safe, how can we then say we just don't want it for political reasons?"" Liese remarked to journalists last week. It also makes sense for the EU to have options, he added, since there's no certainty that other vaccine-makers will deliver on their commitments, given recent history.

Romanian MEP Cristian-Silviu Buşoi, also of the EPP and co-chair of the contact group on vaccines for the European Parliament, takes a different stance. He pointed to media reports concerning the safety of the vaccine as a potential red flag. There have been reports of four deaths and six serious health complications — but Russian authorities have dismissed those reports, saying the vaccine has not caused a single death.

RDIF has also sought to distance itself from the safety issues that have been linked to the other adenoviral vaccines from Johnson & Johnson and Oxford/AstraZeneca, saying that there have been no cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis associated with the shot.

Buşoi also underlined the potential strategic hazard of using the vaccine: ""This is obviously used by Russia as a political tool. Otherwise it would have been used to increase the vaccination rate in Russia, which is still low, rather than exporting it abroad.""

One senior EU diplomat, noting the disarray in Slovakia over the question of the vaccine's data, suggested Berlin's embrace of Sputnik made little sense and wished Germany the ""best of luck.""

""But in politics, in many cases, common sense is not a common practice,"" he added.",1659,10330,7,50

New Delhi, April 17

The police in Australia have arrested an Indian with an expired visa for one among a series of violent incidents within the Indian community over the farm laws.

The man has been remanded to custody after being denied bail in the recent alleged ‘hate crime’ incident in Harris Park, Sydney. A local TV channel, Seven News, reported that the arrested accused person’s visa has expired and could be deported.

“Sikhs identified by their turban were targeted because of tensions in India,” said the report, adding that further arrests are imminent.

Since September last year, local police officers have been investigating a number of incidents in Harris Park of Sydney, reported the Melbourne-based South Asia Times.

The Indian has been charged with three counts of affray, three counts of armed with intent to commit indictable offence, two counts of destroying or damaging and assault.

Detailing the three incidents, the New South Wales (NSW) police said in the first incident on September 16, a man was struck several times in the head with a baseball bat and then kicked when on the ground by a group of five men.

On February 14, a man driving a car was allegedly attacked by a group of up to five men, holding sticks and other weapons.

On February 28, a group of people travelling in a vehicle was allegedly attacked by up to 10 men, seriously damaging the vehicle.

“We are very happy with the NSW Police and hope all the culprits in the incidents are caught. These people have no place in the wider Indian community,” said Amar Singh, Turbans 4 Australia.

He said the Indian government’s representatives in Australia must step-up and take responsibility for the behaviour, most of whom he claimed have been identified by the police.

Australian-Indians have called on the Indian High Commission to step-up interaction with and monitor the behaviour of international students.

They have asked for a pre-flight strategic awareness plan for students coming to study in Australia outlining the country’s laws and values, so that the new arrivals know how they need to behave and what it takes to integrate into the Australian community.",364,2186,9,50

CAIRO -- A passenger train derailed Sunday north of Cairo, killing at least 11 people, Egyptian authorities said. It was the latest of several rail accidents to hit the country in recent years.

Four train wagons ran off the railway at the city of Banha in Qalyubia province, just outside Cairo, the railway authority said in a statement. Videos on social media showed wagons overturned and passengers escaping to safety along the railway.

The train was travelling to the Nile Delta city of Mansoura from the Egyptian capital, the statement said.

The Health Ministry said in a statement that besides the dead, at least 98 people were injured, with most of them suffering from broken bones, cuts and bruises.

At least 60 ambulances were sent to the scene and the injured were taken to nearby hospitals, the ministry added.

Salvage teams could be seen searching for survivors and removing the derailed wagons. It was not immediately clear what caused the train to derail. Prosecutors said they were investigating the causes of the crash.

The state-run Ahram daily reported that authorities have detained at least 10 railway officials, including the train driver and his assistant, pending an investigation into the crash.

At Banha University hospital, people lined up to donate blood for the crash victims. Families were also present looking for loved ones who had been travelling on the train.

“We were surprised by the strain speeding up,” said Tarek Gomaa, one of the injured. “We found ourselves on top of each other.”

Sunday’s train accident came three weeks after two passenger trains collided in the province of Sohag, killing at least 18 people and injuring 200 others, including children.

Prosecutors said they found that gross negligence by railway employees was behind the deadly March 25 crash, which caused public outcry across the country.

Train wrecks and mishaps are common in Egypt, where the railway system has a history of badly maintained equipment and mismanagement. The government says it has launched a broad renovation and modernization initiative. President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said in March 2018 that the government needs about 250 billion Egyptian pounds, or $14.1 billion, to overhaul the run-down rail system.

Hundreds of train accidents are reported every year. In February 2019 an unmanned locomotive slammed into a barrier inside Cairo’s main Ramses railway station, causing a huge explosion and a fire that killed at least 25 people. That crash prompted the then-transportation minister to resign.

In August 2017, two passenger trains collided just outside the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria, killing 43 people. In 2016, at least 51 people were killed when two commuter trains collided near Cairo.

Egypt’s deadliest train crash was in 2002, when over 300 people were killed after a fire broke out in an overnight train traveling from Cairo to southern Egypt.

The Costs of War Project, housed at Brown University’s Watson Institute and Boston University’s Pardee Center, noted in its report that the financial cost included both Afghan operations and those in neighboring Pakistan.



President Joe Biden announced on Wednesday that all U.S. troops will leave Afghanistan by September 11, the 20th anniversary of the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, saying “it is time to end the forever war.” The drawdown of around 3,000 remaining troops from the country, Biden said, would begin on May 1.



“The Costs of War Project also estimates that 241,000 people have died as a direct result of this war. This includes at least 71,344 civilians; 2,442 American service members; 78,314 Afghan military and police; and 84,191 opposition fighters,” the report said.

FILE - U.S. troops patrol at an Afghan National Army base in Logar province, Afghanistan, Aug. 7, 2018.

It noted that the numbers are approximations based on the reporting of several data sources.



“These horrific numbers are testament to the costs of war, first to the Afghan people, and then to the soldiers and people of the United States. Ending the war as soon as possible is the only rational and humane thing to do,” said Catherine Lutz, co-director of Costs of War and professor at Brown University.



Neta Crawford, the project’s lead researcher and professor at Boston University, described as ""the tip of the iceberg” the U.S. Department of Defense spending of more than $900 billion in Afghanistan.



The rest of the money, according to the report, includes an increase of $443 billion in the Pentagon’s base budget to support the war, $296 billion to care for veterans, $530 billion to cover the interest on the money borrowed to fund the military deployments in the South Asian nation, and $59 billion in overseas contingency funds.

“The costs of the Afghanistan war include its escalation into Pakistan, millions of refugees and displaced persons, the toll in lives of combatants and non-combatants, and the need to care for America’s veterans,” Crawford noted.



Pakistan, which joined the U.S.-led military invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, conducted military operations to secure its side of the nearly 2,600-kilometer largely porous border in support of actions by international troops on the Afghan side.



Washington reimbursed Islamabad for the financial costs Pakistani operations incurred from a Coalition Support Fund set up for the purpose.



The Costs of War Project noted that the total estimated $2.26 trillion does not include funds that the U.S. government is obligated to spend on lifetime care for American veterans of the Afghan war, nor does it include future interest payments on money borrowed to fund the war.



A more comprehensive accounting is yet to be completed, the report said. It would include not just money that may or may not have been well spent, but the count of those wounded, those who lost limbs, and the psychological toll of decades of war on combatants and non-combatants and their families.



Stephanie Savell, the project’s co-director and senior research associate, replied in affirmative when asked by VOA whether their researchers had spoken to relevant U.S. administration departments while conducting the study.



“We have spoken with representatives of the administration about this, yes,” Savell said. “Our total number includes the DOD OCO budget (the figure the Pentagon uses to estimate total war costs), but also other ledger items like care for vets, interest on war borrowing, and increases to the Pentagon's base budget due to war,” she explained in a written reply.



The Costs of War Project was launched 10 years ago by a group of scholars and experts to document the “unacknowledged costs” of the post-9/11 wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere, said Friday’s release.

TEHRAN, Iran -- A magnitude 5.9 earthquake shook southwestern Iran along the Persian Gulf on Sunday, followed by over a dozen aftershocks, state TV reported.

At least five people were injured, Iran's state-run IRNA news agency reported.

State TV shared mobile phone pictures of cracked and collapsed walls in the area of the port city of Bandar Genaveh, the temblor's epicenter. People rushed into the streets of the city as the quakes struck, IRNA said.

Video shot by a bystander at an industrial site near Bandar Genaveh appeared to show landslides in nearby foothills. Iranian media widely rebroadcast the footage.

Three aftershocks of magnitude 4 followed the initial quake, the report said, as well as other weaker ones.

Iran's senior Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri, in a phone call with the Bushehr provincial governor, called for the immediate care of quake victims, the semiofficial ISNA news agency reported.

The U.S. Geological Survey called the initial temblor a 5.8 magnitude earthquake. It said its depth was 10 kilometers (6.2 miles).

A magnitude 5 earthquake can cause considerable damage. Such shallow earthquakes as Sunday's also can result in broader damage.

The quake was some 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant.

ISNA quoted an official at the nuclear power plant saying the quake caused no damage and there were no disruptions in the plant's operations. The facility was constructed to withstand earthquakes up to magnitude 8.

Iran is on major seismic faults and experiences one earthquake a day on average. In 2003, a magnitude 6.6 earthquake flattened the historic city of Bam, killing 26,000 people.

A magnitude 7 earthquake that struck western Iran in 2017 killed more than 600 people and injured more than 9,000.",297,1859,6,50
0,German courts ban 'Querdenker' anti-lockdown demos,https://www.dw.com/en/german-courts-ban-querdenker-anti-lockdown-demos/a-57235905,"Regional German courts have imposed bans on ""Querdenker,"" or ""lateral thinking"" demonstrations that were due to take place this weekend against coronavirus curbs.

Gatherings were planned in both Dresden and the Bavarian city of Kempten this weekend, which prompted legal proceedings and court rulings on Friday evening.

Bavaria's Administrative Court agreed with the local authority that a ban on gatherings by groups of mostly COVID-deniers was necessary to prevent the risk of infection. The Querdenker movement, which opposes Germany's current lockdown measures, initially planned an 8,000-strong demonstration and a subsequent march with 2,000 people.

The founder of the initiative, Michael Ballweg, was also expected to participate in the Kempten protest.

Dresden rally banned too

Meanwhile, the Saxony Higher Administrative Court, which presides over the city of Dresden, said that there was justifiable danger for the participants and passers-by, particularly because of the above-average infection rate and the spread of more infectious virus variants.

Additionally, the court said that limiting the number of participants would not be effective.

The ruling said the organizers would not be able to maintain social distancing and safety measures.

The decision is unappealable and any other planned events are also prohibited.

Dresden also banned a rally by supporters of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which logged 500 participants.

Despite the bans, police are still preparing for some demos to take place anyway.

The Querdenker group has hosted several anti-lockdown rallies in recent months, with one demonstration in Leipzig attracting over 20,000 participants from around the region in November.

Justice minister slams COVID demonstrations

German Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht has called on police to take a hardline against coronavirus demonstrations.

A ""crystal-clear red line must be drawn,"" Lambrecht told the Funke Mediengruppe.

""In addition to criminal prosecution, demonstrations must be broken up by the police,"" she said, calling the behavior of some protesters ""absolutely unacceptable.""

""We cannot expect people to be very restrictive in their private lives while at the same time others are flouting all the rules at coronavirus demonstrations,"" she said.

She referred, among other things, to threats issued against scientists and politicians, and violent attacks on journalists.

In December of last year, Berlin placed parts of the movement under surveillance, after it was deemed to be ""infiltrated by extremists.""

Germany is currently grappling with a third coronavirus wave, and is recording a higher number of daily infections than in past months.

On Saturday, health authorities reported 23,804 new infections and 219 deaths, while the number of new infections per 100,000 inhabitants has risen to 160.7 nationwide.

0,Reminder: Never ask the cops in Japan to shoot you,https://soranews24.com/2021/04/16/reminder-never-ask-the-cops-in-japan-to-shoot-you/,"Man in Nagoya learns obvious lesson the hard way.

For most people, Sunday night is a quiet night, as the weekend winds down and they get back into the mental mode necessary for the coming week of work or school. However, last Sunday at around 10 p.m., a 47-year-old man in Nagoya’s Kaminagoya neighborhood was spotted trying to light a fire inside a parking structure.

A passerby noticed flames of some sort and called the police, who dispatched an officer who quickly arrived on scene, finding the suspect on the first floor of the building brandishing a knife. When he realized he’d been spotted, the suspect snarled “Shoot me if you can!” and retreated up to the higher floors.

The officer gave chase, and when they reached the third floor the suspect stopped running, and instead began advancing on the officer. The officer warned him to throw down his weapon, announcing “If you don’t drop the knife, I will shoot you.” Undeterred, the suspect continued advancing. When a warning shot fired at the suspect’s feet still didn’t stop him, the officer obliged the suspect’s request, and made good on his promise, by putting a bullet in the man’s lower abdomen.

▼ The building where the incident took place

Following the shooting, the man was arrested on the spot, although instead of being taken to jail he was transported to the hospital for medical treatment. He was conscious during the ambulance ride, and his life is in no danger.

The incident is similar to one that took place in Osaka a few years ago, when a man advancing on officers while holding a knife told them “If you’re going to shoot me, then do it already” and got a slug in the thigh for his tough talk. So remember, while Japanese police training includes something called taiho-jutsu, or “arresting martial arts techniques,” designed to subdue criminals in a low-impact, low-injury way, the cops will skip the grappling when dealing with someone with a dangerous weapon, especially someone who’s literally asking to get shot.

0,Opponents of Myanmar coup announce unity government,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/16/myanmar-silent-strike,"The committee representing Myanmar’s dismissed parliament has announced the formation of a new “unity government” which includes removed lawmakers, members of ethnic groups and figures in the anti-coup protest, saying their aim was to root out military rule.

The announcement was made on Friday by Dr Sasa, who has been designated by the dismissed parliament as representative to the United Nations.

“For the first time in our history, Myanmar has a unity government,” he declared on social media, posting the document showing Win Myint as president and Aung San Suu Kyi as state counsellor.

Myanmar’s acting Vice President Mahn Win Khaing Than was appointed interim prime minister. Dr Sasa himself has been designated as the union minister in international cooperation.

Today, at the end of Thingyan on the eve of Myanmar’s new year, we are proud to announce the formation of a new National Unity Government and the dawn of a new era for the people of Myanmar. For the first time in our history, Myanmar has a unity government. pic.twitter.com/t2prgeZahB — Dr. Sasa (@DrSasa22222) April 16, 2021

The latest development comes as thousands of people staged different forms of protests nationwide – from the “silent strike” in Yangon to protest marches in Mandalay and elsewhere – against the February 1 coup and denouncing the violent crackdown that killed more than 700 people.

Photos circulating on social media showed Myanmar’s old capital looking like a ghost town as the usually busy streets and intersections are left completely empty. Some vehicles were seen passing by in the downtown area of Yangon, supposedly teeming with people marking the country’s New Year festival.

“Let’s make the roads silent,” protest leader Ei Thinzar Maung posted on her Facebook page. “We have to stage a Silent Strike to show our sorrow for the martyrs who have scarified [sacrificed] their lives. The most silent voice is the loudest.”

Friday is the third day of the five-day traditional Buddhist New Year holiday, known as Thingyan.

Most people this year are shunning the usual festivities to focus on their campaign against the generals who overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi’s government and locked up with many others.

Defiant civilians

In Mandalay, thousands of masked protesters marched carrying huge banners calling for the military to stand down.

Thousands of people also marched in Hpakant, the jade town in Kachin state.

In the Sagaing region, hundreds of protesters rode their vehicles and waved the flag of the National League for Democracy (NLD) of the country’s overthrown leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

On Thursday, a protest organiser in the region, Wai Moe Naing, was detained by the military.

Similar scenes of defiant civilians on their motorbikes were seen along the coast of the Tanintharyi region.

In Loikaw, the capital of Kayah state, hundreds of protesters gathered in an open field to stage a sticky rice ball strike, according to photos posted on social media by the Kantarawaddy Times.

The military has also been rounding up its critics and has published the names of more than 200 people wanted under a law that makes it illegal to encourage mutiny or dereliction of duty in the armed forces.

Late on Thursday, soldiers raided a famous Buddhist monastery in Mandalay and arrested two people, the Myanmar Now media group reported.

The crackdown continued on Friday, with reports of security forces taking civilians from their homes in the Aung Zaya district in Yangon, stopping motorists in Bago Division.",616,3802,7,51

GENEVA (AP) — A top official from the World Health Organization says Europe has surpassed 1 million deaths from COVID-19 and the situation remains “serious,” with about 1.6 million new cases reported each week in the region.

The comments by Dr. Hans Kluge on Thursday aimed to emphasize that Europe must keep up its guard with social distancing and speed up vaccinations as virus variants drive new infections to record levels in some nations.

Overall, a tally by Johns Hopkins University shows nearly 3 million deaths have been linked to COVID-19 worldwide -- with the Americas hardest hit, followed by Europe. The United States, Brazil and Mexico have reported the highest number of deaths, collectively at more than 1.1 million.

Speaking to reporters during a visit to Greece, Kluge did point to “early signs that transmission may be slowing across several countries” in WHO’s 53-country European region, which stretches into Central Asia —and cited “declining incidence” among the oldest people.

He said the proportion of COVID-19 deaths among people over 80, who have been prioritized for vaccines, had dropped to nearly 30% — the lowest level in the pandemic.

Britain in particular has seen new infections and COVID-19 deaths drop dramatically since January, due to a successful vaccination program and a prolonged national lockdown that is only being reversed in stages.

Full Coverage: Coronavirus pandemic

Addressing recent concerns about vaccines, Kluge also said the risk of people suffering blood clots is far higher for people with COVID-19 than for people who receive AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine.

“Let there be no doubt about it, the AstraZeneca vaccine is effective in reducing COVID-19 hospitalization and preventing deaths,” he said, adding that WHO recommends its use for all eligible adults.

0,Chinese Scientists Create New Mutant Bird-Flu Virus,https://www.wired.com/2013/05/h5n1-h1n1-reassortment/,"In nature, some strains of the influenza virus are highly lethal while others jump easily from person to person. What public health officials fear most is a hybrid that combines the lethality of one with the transmissibility of the other, creating a deadly global pandemic.

Now a team of Chinese scientists has investigated that in their lab by creating a new hybrid virus. They combined H5N1 avian influenza, which is highly lethal but doesn't transmit easily between people, with the highly contagious H1N1 swine flu strain responsible for infecting tens of millions of people in 2009.

The new hybrid virus passed easily between guinea pigs, which are used to study how flu infects mammals. Molecular changes in the virus may provide clues of what to look for in circulating H5N1 strains, perhaps allowing scientists to anticipate when viruses will more easily infect humans.

""Mammalian-transmissible H5N1 viruses can be generated in nature,"" said virologist Chen Hualan at China's Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, who led the research team. ""High attention should be paid during routine influenza surveillance to monitor such high risk H5N1 hybrid viruses in nature.""

The experiments, described May 2 in Science, reflect a controversial approach to studying influenza: attempting to create strains in a lab that would, if accidentally released or used for nefarious purposes, pose a potentially global health threat.

Some scientists think the risks don't outweigh the benefits, and that institutional safeguards don't sufficiently reduce chances of accidents. Public unease with such experiments resulted in a year-long moratorium on the research.

According to microbiologist Richard Ebright of Rutgers University, a prominent critic of the work, the new study shows little that wasn't revealed by an H5N1 experiment published in March by one of the research teams that originally sparked the controversy.

That study, led by virologist Ron Fouchier of Erasmus University in the Netherlands, also showed how H5N1 could become more transmissible in mammals.

""The sole major difference is the use of guinea pigs in this paper and ferrets in that paper,"" said Ebright. ""In my assessment, neither paper contains substantive new information that justifies the risks posed by the research.""

Hualan's next research focus is to study the array of genetic changes that allowed his H5N1 strains to infect guinea pigs, perhaps understanding the specific molecular and physiological mechanisms that help particles of flu virus latch onto respiratory cells.

That might give researchers clues about how to interfere with that process, or at least a heads-up on what type of changes to look for in flu strains evolving now in the wild.

""The important thing is that insights from such studies will benefit disease control and prevention,"" Hualan said. Both she and Ebright agreed, however, that mutations seen in the laboratory may be different from the evolutionary paths taken by influenza in the wild.

0,Russian security service detains Ukrainian diplomat,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/17/russian-security-service-detains-ukrainian-diplomat,"Russia on Saturday said it would expel a Ukrainian diplomat, prompting an immediate pledge of retaliation from Kyiv, further escalating tensions after Moscow’s troop buildup on Ukraine’s eastern flank.

The detention of a Ukrainian consul in the second city, St Petersburg, comes at a time of global concern over a possible repeat of Moscow’s 2014 aggression, when Russia annexed the peninsula of Crimea and backed separatists in Ukraine’s east. Moscow claimed that the diplomat had been caught “red-handed” trying to obtain sensitive information.

In response, the Ukrainian foreign ministry condemned “the illegal” detention of its diplomat and said Kyiv would expel a senior Russian diplomat in response.

Kyiv has been battling Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine since 2014 and the clashes there intensified early this year, effectively shredding a ceasefire agreed last July.

About 30 Ukrainian troops have been killed since the start of the year, compared with 50 in all of 2020. Most were victims of sniper fire.

Russia has detained a number of Ukrainian nationals on suspicion of spying in recent years, but it is rare for diplomats to be arrested.

“A Ukrainian diplomat, a consul of Ukraine’s consulate general in Saint Petersburg, Alexander Sosonyuk, has been detained by Russia’s FSB,” the security service said in a statement, using the Russian-language spelling of his name.

He was held on Friday, the security service said. Kyiv said the diplomat had spent several hours in detention.

The Russian foreign ministry said on Saturday it had summoned Ukraine’s chargé d’affaires, Vasyl Pokotylo, and told him that the Ukrainian diplomat had 72 hours to leave the country from 19 April. “The Russian side pointed to the inadmissibility of such kind of activity,” the ministry said in a statement.

Russia’s domestic intelligence agency said Sosonyuk had been caught “red-handed” during a meeting with a Russian national as he sought to receive “classified” information.

“Such activity is not compatible with his diplomatic status and is clearly hostile in nature towards the Russian Federation,” the FSB said. “In conformity with international law, measures will be taken against the foreign diplomat.”

In Kyiv, the Ukrainian foreign ministry said it contested the diplomat’s detention and rejected Russia’s accusations. Spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said Russia had “crudely” violated diplomatic conventions and sought to escalate tensions.

“In response to the abovementioned provocation, a senior diplomat of the Russian embassy in Kyiv must leave Ukrainian territory within 72 hours beginning 19 April,” Nikolenko told AFP. He did not provide further details.

Faced with the largest deployment of Russian troops on Ukraine’s borders since 2014, the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has requested more help from the west, and western leaders have urged the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to stop intimidating his neighbour.

Tensions between Russia and Ukraine come against the background of a new war of words between Moscow and Washington as the new US president, Joe Biden, seeks to take a tougher line against Putin.

The US on Thursday announced sanctions and the expulsion of 10 Russian diplomats in retaliation for what the White House says is the Kremlin’s US election interference, a massive cyber-attack, and other hostile activity.

Russia said on Friday that it would expel US diplomats and sanction US officials in response, while recommending that the US envoy leave Russia “for consultations”.",543,3537,6,51
0,‘Dangerous’ beast in tree turns out to be croissant,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/croissant-tree-poland-animal-b1831943.html,"Animal rescuers in Poland called to a report of a dangerous-looking creature lurking in a tree approached it with trepidation – only to discover the mystery beast was a croissant.

A woman in Krakow had called to say the animal had been in the tree for two days and that residents were afraid to open their windows because they worried it would go into their homes, according to the city’s animal-welfare society.

The organisation, which revealed the case on Facebook, said staff asked her whether it could be a bird of prey but she described as resembling an iguana.

Officers feared the animal was an unwanted pet and could have died of cold or hunger.

One inspector, identified only as Adam, said they were used to pets being abandoned, writing: “We had an old Yorkie thrown into the yard in the evening, a seriously ill cat left in a closed transporter in a dumpster carport in winter, rats and hamsters with a cage thrown in the rubbish, even fish in a street bucket.”

He described how they approached the creature. “Suddenly... Here he is, got him! The brown creature is sitting on a lilac branch … the creature sits and doesn’t move – exactly as the notifier described us.

“His brown skin shines in the sun ... We are looking more closely – poor guy has no legs or head.”

Discovering the object to be a croissant, they guessed it was probably thrown out of a window by a neighbour to feed birds.

“It’s hard to help something that was previously baked, not in the sunlight,” Adam wrote.

The organisation said the public should continue to err on the side of caution and report any concerns about animal welfare.",289,1624,9,51
0,Loneliness and Depression: the Dark Path to Suicide,https://www.theteenmagazine.com/loneliness-and-depression-the-dark-path-to-suicide,"Before you read this article, I want to warn you that if you have any history of depression or loneliness, this may trigger you. It’s just mostly what I’m supposed to say but... take a breather. If you can’t take it, close your laptop, or exit your browser, do not make yourself uncomfortable. If you, however, dare to brave the article, Go grab some warm tea (no coffee) or nice chill OJ, breathe in and out and prepare for what is to come: Suicide.

Oh, did I say a bad word?

Should that even be a bad word in the first place?

Well, it depends on if you’re a victim of depression or a school administrative avoiding lawsuits. Here comes the triggering part: I don’t believe suicide is inherently bad. Before you come at me, suicide is not the great evil to fight, but rather a mirror of it-- a mirror of the pain that pushes someone to such extremes.

Now begs the question, “Is suicide worse than living a terrible and depressing life?” because no happy and fulfilled person ends their life. When someone commits suicide, you may begin to hate the person, to blame the person, or you may hate or blame yourself. “How didn’t I know?” “Did I ignore the signs?”

You probably did, but it’s not necessarily your fault.

Loneliness and depression are concepts I studied in the months following my suicide attempt—yes, MY attempt. It’s crazy, terrible, and hurtful. When you have no one to listen to or to lend an ear to your struggles, it breeds a feeling that there’s nothing to live for anymore. The pain of the present blinds you of any potential for the future. It isn’t your fault; it’s quite natural if I may say.

In the past, Social interaction was important for survival the same way staying out of a lion’s mouth was. But while our communities have evolved to make social interaction less vital for being alive, our bodies have not evolved to sense that it isn’t, so we have social pain (and this takes us back to a lot of sciency stuff that isn’t in the scope of this article). When this pain becomes chronic, it can be twice as deadly as obesity and just as deadly as smoking a cigarette a day. Yes, our priorities are a bit misplaced. The most dangerous thing about loneliness is when it becomes just that: Chronic. It becomes self-sustaining. You become more receptive to social communications and interaction and more sensitive to negative stimuli. You may begin to perceive the world or at least some part of it as if it is against you—When I was in this stage, I began to dream up fantasies, rather nightmares, of the whole world scheming against me— you avoid people for fear of rejection—this may come as sitting at the deserted back of the classroom or on an empty table at lunch or just simply ignoring calls—you feel unwanted, leaving conversations with genuinely interested people, you say no to parties and event invitations. This only leads people to view you negatively, “A snub! Isn't she?”

They exclude you from further things and truly begin to dislike you. Deeper and deeper you go Continuing the cycle that only works to plunge you deeper into loneliness and…

Repeat.

Now, Is suicide really a bad word? Or even a bad choice? Well, I can't answer that question for you; it's rhetorical. I can, however, suggest some things. For starters, we can and should end the stigma on the hidden Pandemic that bites through society: loneliness. We should teach about and talk about loneliness in schools and everywhere. Only then can we freely discuss our problems and eliminate loneliness. Only then, can we stop asking ourselves, “why didn’t I listen?”

The Last thing I have to say is, “reach out.” Do you have a friend you haven’t talked to in a while? Reach out. Say hi. Be awkward. Smile. If you’re vaccinated, have a sleepover or something. Make them laugh but don’t stalk them, and maybe, you can be the person who helps someone escape the vicious cycle that would push them to two options: Suicide or Lingering Unhappiness.",702,3954,8,51

Reuters.com will remain free for a preview period, but will require users to register after five stories. It is not immediately clear when it will begin charging.

The Thomson Reuters-owned news division now joins a crowded market of major news organizations which already charge for their content.

Among them, financial news rival Bloomberg.com charges $34.99 per month before discounts, while the Wall Street Journal, which in 1996 became the first to launch a paywall, charges $38.99.

In an emailed statement, Josh London, Chief Marketing Officer, Reuters and Head of Reuters Professional, called the launch ""the largest digital transformation at Reuters in a decade.""

He added: ""Professionals need direct access to industry knowledge, data and insights from expert sources, and Reuters is pleased to offer our trusted, impartial and accurate news coverage through a premium offering.""

Reuters President Michael Friedenberg and newly appointed Editor in Chief Alessandra Galloni have said the success of the digital and events business is one of their top priorities. read more

Ken Doctor, a veteran media analyst and founder of local news and information company Lookout Local Inc, characterized the introduction of the paywall as ""late, but not too late,"" noting that Bloomberg only started charging for its site in 2018.

""The critical question is to a business news consumer, what added value do I get from Reuters that I don't get from Bloomberg or Dow Jones?"" he added.

Reuters generates around half of its revenue from its biggest client, financial data specialist Refinitiv.

Refinitiv was part of Thomson Reuters until 2018 when a majority stake was purchased by private equity firm Blackstone Group LP in a deal valuing the business at about $20 billion. It was then sold to the London Stock Exchange Group Plc in a $27 billion all-stock deal that closed this year.

Reuters also licenses text, video, pictures, data and graphics to media companies, which, in many cases, offer the content for free to consumers, as well as to tech companies and corporations. And it generates advertising revenue from the website, which attracts around 41 million unique visitors monthly.

The digital operation is one prong of its plan to court professionals that also includes live events, newsletters, channels on streaming TV services Roku and Plex and on audio through Amazon.com Inc, the company has said.

Toronto-headquartered Thomson Reuters invested what several former executives have estimated at $20 million less than a decade ago to rebuild the website. It pulled the plug on the plan in 2013 as it was ""far away from commercial viability or strategic success,"" former Reuters CEO Andrew Rashbass told employees in an internal memo at the time.

A Reuters spokeswoman declined to comment on the investment figure.

The new iteration of the digital strategy includes a deeper investment in areas such as legal news, where it has added journalists and launched new products, including daily newsletters. It will also offer live streams of Reuters events to subscribers.

0,Petraeus Trashes Biden Decision to Quit Afghanistan,https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2021/04/petraeus-trashes-biden-decision-quit-afghanistan/173359/,"David Petraeus sharply criticized President Joe Biden’s decision to remove U.S. troops there, saying he worries that the “endless war” will only worsen.

“I'm really afraid that we're going to look back two years from now and regret the decision,” said Petraeus, former commanding general of U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan and former CIA director.

He spoke on a conference video call originally intended to promote a new book from retired admiral William McRaven, who oversaw the 2011 mission to find Osama bin Laden.

On the call, McRaven and other leaders of that mission, including then-CIA Director Leon Panetta, were split in their support for Biden’s decision to reposition U.S. troops to support counterterrorism missions from elsewhere in the region. But Petraeus delivered a sharper rebuke.

“I understand the frustrations very much that have led to the decision,” said Petraeus. “Nobody wants to see a war ended more than those who have actually fought it, and been privileged to command it and also write the letters of condolence home every night to America’s mothers and fathers. But I think we need to be really careful with our rhetoric, because ending U.S. involvement in an endless war doesn't end the endless war. It just ends our involvement. And I fear that this war is going to get worse.”

Petraeus said he worries the Taliban will go on the offensive, ungoverned spaces will grow, and the terrorist organizations that use them will flourish. “I don’t see how you withdraw and maintain the capabilities that one would like to have there still.”

“Frankly, we’re also going to lose that platform that Afghanistan provides for the kind of regional counterterrorism campaign,” he said. “I'm really afraid that we're going to look back two years from now and regret the decision and just wonder if whether we might not have sought to manage it with a modest, sustainable, sustained commitment that could have ensured that al Qaeda and the Islamic State would not re-establish sanctuaries from which they undoubtedly will try to figure out over time how to conduct operations that go after us, our allies, and our partners.”

McRaven said any decision incurs risks. He added that if the U.S. military is still tasked to respond to terrorism inside Afghanistan, he hopes the U.S. will retain the necessary capabilities in the country and the region.

“If you gave me the resources, I could figure out how to do this,” McRaven said, adding that he has spoken to key players close to the president about it.

“I will tell you from all my conversations with folks that are kind of in the inner circle, they have considered all of those problems,” he said. “All of the warts have been exposed to the president. He understands the risk that he’s taken.”

“Now, are we going to need some people on the ground? Yeah, we are,” he said. “We’re going to need at least some small footprint at a Bagram [Air Base]. We’re going to need a small footprint, obviously, in the capital. We’re going to need intelligence resources. I think the administration will figure out how to manage theat.”

Other Obama-era officials weighed in with support. James Clapper, former director of national intelligence, said, “I do have a lot of confidence in the growing capabilities that we have — that we didn’t have 10 or 20 years ago.”

""We are at a different level of capability"" with intelligence and have ""a lot of over-the-horizon"" capability now, said Tom Donilon, former national security advisor. Meanwhile, the Taliban is not the same problem it once was, and if it grows anew, the U.S. can handle it, he said. “The Taliban is not an international threat to the United States.” And he noted that the White House is facing new global needs and changing priorities.

Petraeus warned that the pullout would create potentially destabilizing refugee flows.

“We are going to see an exodus out of this country of anybody who has an option to leave,” he said. And of those who lack that option? “I would not, certainly, want to be part of the 50 percent of Afghans that are female.”

Expect a new Taliban offensive and more extensive safe havens for other terror groups, he said.

“They are not international extremists, but they are going to enable or allow international extremists to reestablish bases in areas that they control. They have done that already. We’ve seen that repeatedly, and supposedly right now a double-digit number of provinces actually have an al Qaeda presence in areas that are controlled by the Taliban. So I’m pretty worried about this.”

Petraeus also said he felt Biden overestimated the public’s desire to leave. “It’s an unforced error,” he said, arguing that the public cares mostly about high battlefield casualties, of which there have been none in more than a year.

Others disagreed.

""It's not just a phrase,” said Donilon. “Endless wars without specific goals in mind is not...healthy for the United States.""

“If we don’t get out now, we'll never get out,” said Jane Harman, president emerita of the Wilson Center and former ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee. She said the country hates “this endless war thing” and that Biden’s decision does play well, in part because Congress, which is supposed to speak for the people, has been absent from the conversation. “We are taking the high ground.”

Said John Brennan, former CIA director: “I do think we are going to have some challenging times ahead…but I do think that Joe Biden, at the end of the day, felt that 20 years was enough.”

In a separate event with CQ Roll Call on Wednesday, former Afghanistan War commander Stanley McChrystal said that he spent a decade in or around Afghanistan and while its security remains important to the United States, he sounded resigned to the end of the war era.

""I won't opine on President Biden's decision, and in reality I don't think we know if it's a great decision or a bad one, and we won't know for a while because I think it depends how things play out,"" he said. He said that Americans should still know that ""Afghanistan does matter"" still to the United States for many reasons, including because of China's Belt-and-Road initiative that seeks to expand Beijing's influence in the region.

McChrystal, who was fired from his command by Obama in 2010, said he keeps mounted on wall an old British musket given to him in Afghanistan, leftover from ""one of their failed efforts to control Afghanistan."" He pointed it out because, he said, ""it's possible for nations, to include our own, to have a certain amount of hubris on what we can and are willing to accomplish.""",1124,6619,7,51
0,Moscow Expels 20 Czech Diplomats – Foreign Ministry,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/04/18/moscow-expels-20-czech-diplomats-foreign-ministry-a73638,"Moscow said 20 employees of the Czech embassy had been declared ""persona non grata"" and must leave the country by the end of Monday.

Russia on Sunday announced the expulsion of 20 Czech diplomats a day after Prague's ""unprecedented"" decision to expel 18 Russian diplomats identified as secret agents.

The expulsions were unveiled after the Czech ambassador in Moscow, Vitezslav Pivonka, had been summoned by the Russian Foreign Ministry.

""Pivonka had been told that 20 employees of the Czech embassy in Moscow had been declared 'persona non grata',"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

""They have been ordered to leave our country by the end of April 19, 2021,"" the ministry added, calling the Czech government's decision to expel Russian diplomats a ""hostile act.""

On Saturday, Czech authorities said they would expel 18 Russian diplomats identified by local intelligence as secret agents of the Russian SVR and GRU security services that are suspected of involvement in a 2014 explosion.

Czech police also said they were seeking two Russians in connection with the blast that killed two people, and who carried passports used by suspects in the attempted poisoning of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in Britain in 2018.

Moscow alleged the move bore a ""trace"" of involvement by Washington.

""In their desire to please the United States against the background of recent U.S. sanctions against Russia, Czech authorities in this respect even outdid their masters from across the pond,"" the ministry added earlier Sunday.

This week the United States announced sanctions and the expulsion of 10 Russian diplomats in retaliation for what Washington said was the Kremlin's US election interference, a massive cyber attack and other hostile activity.",280,1768,8,51
0,At least 40 migrants drown in shipwreck off Tunisia,https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/at-least-40-migrants-drown-in-shipwreck-off-tunisia-665382,"TUNIS - At least 40 migrants drowned in a shipwreck off Tunisia as they tried to cross the Mediterranean to Italy, United Nations and Tunisian officials said on Friday.

The Tunisian costguard had so far recovered 21 bodies, all African migrants, and rescued three people, Tunisian officials said. The dead included at least one child.

""The boat sank during a trip that started late on Thursday from Sfax... So far, the coastguard has recovered 21 bodies and the search is still continuing,"" Mouard Mechri, director of Tunisia's civil protection service, told Reuters.

The coastline near the port city of Sfax has become a major departure point for people fleeing conflict and poverty in Africa and the Middle East and seeking a better life in Europe.

Last month 39 migrants died off Sfax in a similar accident.

The UN migration agency IOM and the UN refugee agency UNHCR said in a statement: ""This tragic loss of life underscores once again the need to enhance and expand State-led search and rescue operations across the Central Mediterranean.""

Some 290 people have lost their lives in such shipwrecks this year, they said.",188,1130,9,51
0,US and China commit to cooperating on climate crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/18/us-and-china-commit-to-cooperating-on-climate-crisis,"The US and China have “committed to cooperating” on the pressing issue of climate change, the two sides said in a joint statement on Saturday, following a visit to Shanghai by US climate envoy John Kerry.

“The United States and China are committed to cooperating with each other and with other countries to tackle the climate crisis, which must be addressed with the seriousness and urgency that it demands,” said the statement from Kerry and China’s special envoy for climate change, Xie Zhenhua.

Kerry, the former US secretary of state, was the first official from president Joe Biden’s administration to visit China, signalling hopes the two sides could work together on the global challenge despite sky-high tensions on multiple other fronts.

It comes as world leaders prepare for a virtual summit on climate change this week as Joe Biden leads a new push to cut emissions. The US president has invited 40 leaders, including Chinese president Xi Jinping, to take part in the two-day summit starting on Friday 22 April, Earth Day, to galvanise efforts by major economies to combat climate change ahead of key UN talks hosted by the UK this year.

The statement said both countries “look forward” to the summit, but did not specify if Xi would attend.

“We very much hope he will take part,” Kerry, who is now in South Korea, told reporters on Sunday.

“Of course, every country will make its own decisions,” he said, adding: “We’re not seeking to force anybody. We’re seeking cooperation.”

China currently has about half of the world’s coal power, Kerry said, adding that he “talked a lot” about it with officials in Shanghai.

“I am not pointing fingers,” said Kerry. “We’ve had too much coal, other countries have too much coal, but China is the biggest, biggest coal user in the world. And because it’s such a big and powerful economy and country, it needs to move.”

The joint statement listed multiple avenues of cooperation between the US and China, the world’s top two economies that together account for nearly half of the greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change.

It stressed “enhancing their respective actions and cooperating in multilateral processes, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement”.

The nations also agreed to discuss specific “concrete” emission reduction actions including energy storage, carbon capture and hydrogen, and agreed to take action to maximise financing for developing countries to switch to low-carbon energy sources.

While Biden hoped countries would make climate commitments ahead of the Earth Day summit, Chinese vice foreign minister Le Yucheng signalled last week that China was unlikely to make any new pledges.

“For a big country with 1.4 billion people, these goals are not easily delivered,” Le said during an interview with the Associated Press in Beijing, conducted while Kerry was still in Shanghai for talks.

“Some countries are asking China to achieve the goals earlier. I am afraid this is not very realistic.”

On whether Xi would join the summit, Le said “the Chinese side is actively studying the matter”.

During a video meeting with German and French leaders on Friday, Xi also said that climate change “should not become a geopolitical chip, a target for attacking other countries or an excuse for trade barriers,” though he called for closer cooperation on the issue, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.

Li Shuo, senior climate adviser for the environmental group Greenpeace, welcomed the joint statement, saying China could soon respond to a new US pledge with one of its own, building on the “momentum” of the Shanghai talks.

“The statement in my view is as positive as the politics would allow: it sends a very unequivocal message that on this particular issue (China and the United States) will cooperate. Before the meetings in Shanghai this was not a message that we could assume,” Li said.

Biden has made climate a top priority, turning the page from his predecessor Donald Trump, who was closely aligned with the fossil fuel industry.

The US president has rejoined the 2015 Paris accord, which Kerry negotiated when he was secretary of state, and committed nations to taking action to keep temperature rises at no more than two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

Biden has pledged the US will switch to an emissions-free power sector within 14 years, and have an entirely emissions-free economy by 2050. Kerry is also pushing other nations to commit to carbon neutrality by then.

Xi announced last year that China would be carbon-neutral by 2060 and aims to reach a peak in its emissions by 2030. In March, China’s Communist party pledged to reduce carbon emissions per unit of economic output by 18% over the next five years, in line with its goal for the previous five-year period. But environmentalists say China needs to do more.",807,4906,9,52
0,Russia expels 20 Czech diplomats in retaliatory move,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/18/russia-expels-20-czech-diplomats-in-retaliatory-move,"Russia gives diplomats just over 24 hours to leave the country, in response to Czech expulsion of 18 Russian diplomats.

Russia on Sunday expelled 20 Czech diplomats in retaliation for a slew of diplomatic expulsions by Prague and gave the affected Czech diplomats just over 24 hours to leave the country, the RIA news agency quoted the foreign ministry as saying.

The Czech Republic on Saturday expelled 18 Russian diplomats, giving them 72 hours to leave, after saying that two alleged Russian spies accused of a nerve agent poisoning in Britain in 2018 were behind a deadly explosion at a Czech ammunition depot four years earlier.

The Czech Republic said it had informed NATO and European Union allies that it suspected Russia of causing the 2014 blast, and European Union foreign ministers were set to discuss the matter at their meeting on Monday.

The US State Department commended Prague’s firm response to “Russia’s subversive actions on Czech soil”.

The row is the biggest between Prague and Moscow since the end of decades of Soviet domination of eastern Europe in 1989.

It also adds to growing tensions between Russia and the West in general, raised in part by Russia’s military build-up on its Western borders and in Crimea, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014, after a surge in fighting between government and pro-Russian forces in Ukraine’s east.

A man carrying a NATO flag outside the Russian embassy in Prague [David W Cerny/Reuters] Czech police said they were seeking two Russians in connection with the 2014 blast that killed two people, and who carried passports used by suspects in the attempted poisoning of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in 2018.

Russia said Prague’s accusations were absurd as it had previously blamed the blast at Vrbetice, 300 km (210 miles) east of the capital, on the depot’s owners.

It called the expulsions “the continuation of a series of anti-Russian actions undertaken by the Czech Republic in recent years”, accusing Prague of “striving to please the United States against the backdrop of recent US sanctions against Russia”.

Earlier this week, the US announced sanctions and the expulsion of 10 Russian diplomats in retaliation for what Washington said was the Kremlin’s US election interference, a massive cyber attack and other hostile activity.

Russia responded in kind, saying it would expel 10 US diplomats and take other retaliatory moves in a tense showdown with Washington.

‘Full support’

EU and NATO partners stood by Czech officials, with British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab saying on Sunday that Britain “stands in full support of our Czech allies”.

“I resolutely condemn the subversive activities targeting the security of … our closest neighbour and ally,” Slovak Foreign Minister Ivan Korcok said in a tweet.

Protesters hold up a flag made of red underwear in front of the Russian Embassy in Prague [Michal Cizek/AFP] “Killing the citizens of the Czech Republic on its territory by another country, that’s almost an act of war,” protester Tomas Peszynski told AFP news agency at a rally outside the Russian embassy in Prague on Sunday afternoon.

About 100 protesters sported banners, saying: “We’re not Russia’s backyard”. They chanted “Shame” while waving EU and NATO flags.

The night before, police detained seven people who had smeared the embassy wall with ketchup, symbolising blood.

Czech politicians joined the outcry, with government ministers saying Russian companies should not take part in the planned construction of a new nuclear unit worth billions of euros for security reasons.

0,Europe eyes strict rules for artificial intelligence,https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-strict-rules-artificial-intelligence/,"The rules carve out an exception allowing authorities to use the tech if they're fighting serious crime | Image via iStock

Press play to listen to this article Voiced by Amazon Polly

No HAL 9000s or Ultrons on this continent, thank you very much.

The European Union wants to avoid the worst of what artificial intelligence can do — think creepy facial recognition tech and many, many Black Mirror episodes — while still trying to boost its potential for the economy in general.

According to a draft of its upcoming rules, obtained by POLITICO, the European Commission would ban certain uses of ""high-risk"" artificial intelligence systems altogether, and limit others from entering the bloc if they don't meet its standards. Companies that don't comply could be fined up to €20 million or 4 percent of their turnover. The Commission will unveil its final regulation on April 21.

The rules are the first of their kind to regulate artificial intelligence, and the EU is keen to highlight its unique approach. It doesn't want to leave powerful tech companies to their own devices like in the U.S., nor does it want to go by the way of China in harnessing the tech to fashion a surveillance state. Instead, the bloc says it wants a ""human-centric"" approach that both boosts the tech, but also keeps it from threatening its strict privacy laws.

That means AI systems that streamline manufacturing, model climate change, or make the energy grid more efficient would be welcome. But many technologies currently in use in Europe today, such as algorithms used to scan CVs, make creditworthiness assessments, hand out social security benefits or asylum and visa applications, or help judges make decisions, would be labeled as ""high risk,"" and would be subject to extra scrutiny.

Checks and balances

Social scoring systems, such as those launched in China that track the trustworthiness of people and businesses, are classified as ""contravening the Union values"" and are going to be banned.

The proposal also wants to prohibit AI systems that cause harm to people by manipulating their behavior, opinions or decisions; exploit or target people's vulnerabilities; and for mass surveillance.

But the rules carve out an exception allowing authorities to use the tech if they're fighting serious crime. The use of facial recognition technology in public places, for example, could be allowed if its use is limited in time and geography. The Commission said it would allow for exceptional cases in which law enforcement officers could use facial recognition technology from CCTV cameras to find terrorists, for example.

The exception is likely designed to appease countries like France, which is keen to integrate AI into its security apparatus, but is opposed by privacy hawks and digital rights activists who have lobbied hard for these uses to be banned outright.

“Giving discretion to national authorities to decide which use cases to permit or not simply recreates the loopholes and grey areas that we already have under current legislation and which have led to widespread harm and abuse,” said Ella Jakubowska of digital rights group EDRi.

The EU is also keen to avoid issues of racial and gender bias, which have plagued the development of the technology from its inception. One of the Commission’s requirements in the draft are that data sets do not “incorporate any intentional or unintentional biases” which may lead to discrimination.

The draft also proposes creating a European Artificial Intelligence Board, comprising one representative per EU country, the EU's data protection authority, and a European Commission representative. The board will supervise the law’s application and share best practices.

Transatlantic tensions

Industry is likely to take issue with the stringent rules, which they say would make the EU market less appealing and encourage European innovators to launch elsewhere.

The strict rules could also put the EU in the crosshairs of its allies. The U.S., which is far more concerned about countering China, and whose companies are likely to be subject to the regulation, is likely to have preferred a looser bill. Surveillance remains one of Europe's key sticking points when it comes to transatlantic collaboration with the U.S.

In an interview with POLITICO in March, Eric Schmidt, Google's former chief and chair of the U.S. National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI), said Europe's strategy won't be successful, as it is ""simply not big enough"" to compete.

""Europe will need to partner with the United States on these key platforms,” Schmidt said, referring to American big tech companies which dominate the development of AI technologies.

0,"US imposes new sanctions on Russia, expels diplomats",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/15/us-imposes-new-sanctions-on-russia-expels-diplomat,"The actions are, in part, a response to the SolarWinds hack and alleged Russian attempts to meddle in the 2020 elections.

United States President Joe Biden has signed an executive order that imposes a slate of new sanctions against Russia, as well as expelling 10 diplomats from the US, in response to a massive Russian hacking campaign that breached vital federal agencies, as well as for election interference.

President Biden said he warned Russia President Vladimir Putin about the sanctions when they spoke by telephone in a “candid, respectful conversation” on April 13.

“I was clear with President Putin that we could have gone further, but I chose not to do so. I chose to be proportionate,” Biden said in remarks at the White House on Thursday.

“The United States is not looking to kick-off a cycle of escalation and conflict with Russia. We want a stable, predictable relationship,” the US president said.

The sanctions, foreshadowed for weeks by the US administration, represent the first retaliatory action announced against the Kremlin for last year’s hack, familiarly known as the SolarWinds breach.

In that intrusion, Russian hackers are believed to have infected widely used software with malicious code, enabling them to access the networks of at least nine agencies in what US officials believe was an intelligence-gathering operation aimed at mining government secrets.

The order “sends a signal that the United States will impose costs in a strategic and economically impactful manner on Russia if it continues or escalates its destabilizing international actions,” the White House said in a statement.

“Our objective here is not to escalate, our objective here is to impose costs for what we feel are unacceptable actions by the Russian government,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Thursday. “We still believe that when there’s unacceptable behaviour, we should put consequences in place.”

Besides that hack, US officials last month alleged that Russian President Vladimir Putin authorised influence operations to help former US President Donald Trump in his unsuccessful bid for re-election, although there’s no evidence that Russia or anyone else changed votes or manipulated the outcome.

Russia has denied involvement in both the SolarWinds hack and the election meddling.

The White House on Thursday said the most recent punitive actions were also motivated by Moscow “targeting dissidents or journalists” and the undermining of “security in countries and regions important to the United States national security”, apparent references to the alleged Russian nerve-agent attack on opposition leader Alexey Navalny and a recent build-up of troops along the border of Ukraine.

Biden did not mention Navalny’s imprisonment in his remarks at the White House on Thursday but said he had warned Putin to refrain from any military action in Ukraine and Crimea. “Now is the time to de-escalate,” Biden said.

The US president reiterated he has invited the Russian leader to a summit meeting to be held in Europe that would allow the two world powers to engage in direct talks on arms control and security issues including Iran and North Korea.

“My hope and expectation is we’ll be able to work out a modus vivendi,” Biden said, emphasizing the US’s “unwavering” support for allies and partners in Europe. Ukraine is not a NATO ally but has been receiving US military and financial support.

Today, the United States took far-reaching action against the Russian Government in response to its harmful acts. We will continue to hold Russia to account for its adversarial actions. — Secretary Antony Blinken (@SecBlinken) April 15, 2021

In its statement on Thursday, the administration also referenced a CIA assessment that Russia offered to pay bounties to members of the Taliban in Afghanistan to target US troops, saying that due to the “sensitivity of this matter”, the response is being handled through diplomatic, military and intelligence channels.

Speaking to CNN before the announcement, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan called the actions “proportionate measures to defend American interests in response to harmful Russian actions including cyber intrusions and election interference”.

“[Biden’s] goal is to provide a significant and credible response but not to escalate the situation. He believes that the United States and Russia can have a stable and predictable relationship,” said Sullivan, adding that the administration is calling on Putin to discuss the issues at a summit proposed by Biden in a phone call with the Russian leader on Tuesday.

The measures announced Thursday include sanctions on six Russian companies that support the country’s cyber activities, in addition to sanctions on 32 individuals and entities accused of attempting to interfere in last year’s presidential election, including by spreading disinformation.

The 10 diplomats being expelled include representatives of Russian intelligence services, the White House said.

It was not immediately clear what, if any, other actions might be planned, with officials previously saying they expected to take actions both “seen and unseen”.

Measures ‘in no way help’

Before the official announcement, the Kremlin on Thursday said the actions would make a possible Biden-Putin summit more difficult.

“What is currently being discussed – likely sanctions – will in no way help such a meeting. That is unambiguous,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday.

The Kremlin also summoned US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan on Wednesday and told him that Washington must refrain from introducing new sanctions on Russia if it wants to mend ties, a Russian foreign ministry spokesperson told AFP.

In their call on Tuesday, Biden and Putin had said they would “continue dialogue”, after ties plummeted when the US president caused an uproar in Moscow last month by agreeing with a description of his Russian counterpart as a “killer”.

Still, it remained unclear whether the US actions would actually result in changed behaviour, especially since past measures by the US have failed to bring an end to Russian hacking.

The administration of former US President Barack Obama expelled diplomats from the US in 2016 in response to interference in that year’s presidential election.

Although Trump was often reluctant to criticise Putin, his administration also expelled diplomats in 2018 for Russia’s alleged poisoning of an ex-intelligence officer in the United Kingdom.

Meanwhile, US officials continue to grapple with the aftereffects of the SolarWinds intrusion, which affected agencies including the Treasury, Justice, Energy and Homeland Security departments, and are still assessing what information may have been stolen. The breach exposed vulnerabilities in the supply chain as well as weaknesses in the federal government’s own cyber defenses.

The planned actions represent the second major round of sanctions imposed by the Biden administration against Russia.",1088,7030,8,52

Eleven people were killed and 98 injured on Sunday in a train accident in Egypt's Qalioubia province north of Cairo, the health ministry said in a statement.

The train was heading from Cairo to the Nile Delta city of Mansoura when four carriages derailed at 1:54 p.m. (1154 GMT), about 40 kms (25 miles) north of Cairo, Egyptian National Railways said in a short statement.

The cause of the accident is being investigated, it added.

More than 50 ambulances took the injured to three hospitals in the province, the health ministry said.

The derailing is the latest of several recent railway crashes in Egypt. At least 20 people were killed and nearly 200 were injured in March when two trains collided near Tahta, about 440 kms (275 miles) south of Cairo.

Fifteen people were injured this month when two train carriages derailed near Minya al-Qamh city, about 70 kms north of Cairo.

Egypt's transportation minister Kamel El-Wazir, a former army general, has faced calls to resign from some Egyptians on social media. He has rejected these and vowed to keep working on developing the ageing rail network.

Israelis went about barefaced on Sunday after the order to wear masks outdoors was rescinded in another step towards relative normality thanks to the country’s mass-vaccination against COVID-19.

With about 81% of citizens or residents over 16 - the age group eligible for the Pfizer/BioNTech (PFE.N), (22UAy.DE) vaccine in Israel - having received both doses, contagions and hospitalisations are down sharply.

But entry by foreigners is still limited and non-immune Israelis who return from abroad must self-isolate, due to concern virus variants could challenge the vaccine. read more The Health Ministry said it had detected seven cases of a new Indian variant in Israel, whose potency was being assessed.

""We are leading the world right now when it comes to emerging from the coronavirus,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters. ""(But) we have still not finished with the coronavirus. It can return.""

The police-enforced wearing of protective masks outdoors, ordered a year ago for non-exercise activities, was scrapped. But the Health Ministry said the requirement still applied for indoor public spaces and urged citizens to keep masks to hand.

""Breathing Freely,"" read the cover headline of the mass-circulation daily Israel Hayom.

""Being without a mask for the first time in a long time feels weird. But it's a very good weird,"" Amitai Hallgarten, 19, said while sunning himself at a park. ""If I need to be masked indoors to finish with this - I'll do everything I can.""

With Israeli kindergarteners, elementary and high school students already back in class, middle school pupils who had been kept at home or attended class sporadically returned to pre-pandemic schedules.

Teachers were instructed to continue ventilating classrooms and to maintain social distancing in lessons and breaks. Extra-curricular activities such as children's theatres remain off-limits.

""This is still a non-vaccinated population (children under the age of 16) that we want to safeguard,"" Health Ministry official Sharon Alroy-Preis told Israel's Army Radio.

Israel counts East Jerusalem Palestinians among its 9.3 million population and has administered the vaccines there.

The 5.2 million Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Islamist Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip have been receiving limited supplies of vaccines provided by Israel, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, the global COVAX vaccine-sharing scheme and China.

Maharashtra and Delhi on Friday reported their biggest ever single-day surge in coronavirus cases, according to government data.

While Delhi reported 19,486 Covid cases in the last 24 hours, Maharashtra logged 63,729 infections.

The national capital also reported 141 deaths, which is its biggest one-day Covid death count. The city's active cases have risen to highest-ever 61,000. The recovery rate has dropped to 90.94 per cent.

Delhi's positivity rate was 19.69 per cent. 12,649 Covid patients were discharged in the last 24 hours. Nearly 99,000 coronavirus tests were conducted in the city during the period.

Maharashtra, the worst-hit state, logged 398 deaths in the last 24 hours. 45,335 patients were discharged.

Out of 2,33,08,878 laboratory samples, 37,03,584 have been tested positive (15.89%) for the virus until today, the state government said in a statement.

Currently 35,14,181 people are in home quarantine and 25,168 people are in institutional quarantine.

Pune reported 11,047 cases and 47 deaths. Mumbai logged 8,803 cases and 53 deaths in the last 24 hours, followed by Nagpur with 6,395 cases and 23 deaths.

India today logged a record 2,17,353 daily coronavirus cases as many states - including Delhi and Maharashtra - grappled with shortages of hospital beds, oxygen, medicines and vaccine doses.

1,185 people dying of Covid in a day pushed the country's death count to 1,74,308. Over 2.17 lakh people tested positive for the virus.

Experts say people's carelessness in following anti-Covid rules and new mutant variants are behind the surge.

Both Maharashtra and Delhi have imposed night curfews and weekend lockdowns to fight the rapid second wave of infections.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi was today briefed about the efforts being made by the government to import medical grade oxygen to bridge the demand-supply gap.

Eight members of a family were killed when unknown attackers opened fire on them at a mosque in Afghanistan’s eastern Nangarhar province.

The shooting happened on Saturday night in the city of Jalalabad. According to Nangarhar Governor Ziaulhaq Amarkhil, the killings happened apparently over a land dispute.

Five brothers and three of their male cousins were killed.

“The shooting happened at the time of the tarawih [extra prayers in the evening during Ramadan]. This was a targeted attack and initial information shows a land dispute was the reason,” Amarkhil told Al Jazeera.

Clashes over land disputes are common across Afghanistan. The so-called blood feuds can last for decades, passing down through generations in a cycle of violence.

Last April, at least six tribal members were killed and nearly 20 others wounded in armed clashes over disputed land in the same province. The fighting lasted for several days.

0,India Covid variant arrives in UK: Everything we know,https://news.yahoo.com/india-covid-variant-arrives-uk-120440252.html,"People take part in coronavirus surge testing on Clapham Common, south London (Kirsty O'Connor/PA)

The discovery of 77 cases of a new Covid-19 variant, which first emerged in India, has caused concern among scientists and the government.

Public Health England (PHE) said 73 cases of the B.1.617 variant have been confirmed in England as well as four cases in Scotland.

Officials consider it a “variant under investigation (VUI)” rather than a “variant of concern (VOC) such as the Manaus (Brazil) or South African variants.

Why are there concerns about the Indian coronavirus variant?

The Indian coronavirus variant is considered to have concerning epidemological, immunological or pathogenic properties.

Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the variant features two ""escape mutations"" – E484Q and L452R – which ""are causing people to be concerned"".

""There's laboratory evidence that both of these are escape mutations,"" he told the PA news agency.

""Basically, applying what we know about other human coronaviruses would suggest that this is going to be even less controlled by vaccine. But we don't know that for certain at the moment.""

Will the UK ban travel from India?

Covid-19 rates are soaring in India, with more than 13.9 million confirmed cases and 172,000 deaths.

However, the country is not currently on the government’s “red list” of travel ban nations.

British or Irish nationals, or people with UK residency rights, are able to return from red list countries but must isolate in a quarantine hotel for 10 days.

Boris Johnson has scaled down a planned trip to India due to its worsening Covid situation, and amid a warning from a member of Independent Sage that the scheduled trip is “crazy.”

How did the variant arrive in the UK?

Prof Hunter said it is ""not surprising"" that the variant has come from India.

""If you think about where the main variants have arisen – South Africa, the UK, California, Brazil, and now India – all of these are countries that have really struggled to keep case numbers down.

Story continues

""So it's not surprising. India has got a huge pandemic, and therefore that's where you're going to be getting the variant.""

He added: ""The big, big anxiety with this one is that it seems – and again this is still a little bit speculative because it hasn't been confirmed – but... there are two mutations here that are causing people to be concerned.""

How many variants does the UK have?

There are now seven VUIs and four VOCs being tracked by scientists in the UK.

A significant cluster of cases of the South African variant of the virus were found in the London borough of Wandsworth, Lambeth, Barnet and Southwark earlier this week.

A total of 600 cases of the variant of concern have been detected so far in the UK, an increase of 56 in a week.

It prompted a large-scale surge testing operation to test thousands of people living in working in those areas.

REUTERS/Stringer

Opponents of military rule in Myanmar observed a “silent strike” on Friday, with many people staying home to mourn the more than 700 people killed in protests against a Feb. 1 coup and others wearing black held small marches in several cities and towns.

Many Myanmar citizens, infuriated by the return of military rule after five years of civilian government led by democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi, have been taking to the streets day after day with activists thinking up new ways to show opposition as the security forces step up their suppression.

loading

""Let's make the roads silent,"" protest leader Ei Thinzar Maung posted on her Facebook page.

""We have to stage a Silent Strike to show our sorrow for the martyrs who have scarified their lives. The most silent voice is the loudest.""

Friday is the fourth day of the five-day traditional Buddhist New Year holiday, known as Thingyan. Most people this year are shunning the usual festivities to focus on their campaign against the generals who overthrew Suu Kyi's government and locked up her and many others.

Streets in the main city of Yangon were largely deserted, residents said, while black-clad protesters held small rallies in half a dozen cities and towns, media reported.

There were no immediate reports of violence but overnight, two people were shot and killed in the central town of Myingyan, Radio Free Asia reported.

A spokesman for the junta could not be reached for comment.

The military has also been rounding up its critics and has published the names of more than 200 people wanted under a law that makes it illegal to encourage mutiny or dereliction of duty in the armed forces.

Two prominent protest organisers were arrested on Thursday along with an actor and singer, both known for speaking out against the coup.

Late on Thursday, soldiers raided a famous Buddhist monastery in the second city of Mandalay and arrested two people, the Myanmar Now media group reported.

SOUTH KOREANS END VENTURE

Opponents have been organising both at home and abroad with the aim of stepping up their campaign.

A previously unknown group called the Ayeyarwaddy Federal Army said on Facebook it aimed to fight the military to restore an elected government and protect the people and it called for volunteers.

It gave no details about how it aimed to take on the well-equipped and seasoned army, which has been battling ethnic minority insurgents for decades.

International pressure has also been slowly building on the military, particularly from Western governments, though the military has a long record of brushing off outside pressure.

The European Union has agreed to impose sanctions on another 10 individuals linked to the coup and to target two businesses run by the armed forces for the first time in protest at the military takeover, two diplomats said.

While the EU has an arms embargo on Myanmar and targeted 11 senior military officials last month, the decision to target the two companies is the most significant response for the bloc since the coup.

EU diplomats told Reuters in March that parts of the military's conglomerates, Myanma Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC), would be targeted, barring EU investors and banks from doing business with them.

Human rights groups have also called for them to be sanctioned.

The EU declined to comment and no one at Myanmar's mission to the EU in Brussels could be reached for reaction.

In rare action by an Asian company, South Korea’s POSCO Coated & Color Steel Co Ltd (POSCO C&C) (058430.KS) said on Friday it would end its joint venture with MEHL.

The firm did not give details of how it would end the venture but a spokesman told Reuters while it was ending the venture relationship, it was not pulling out of Myanmar.

Leaders of Southeast Asian neighbours, which have been trying to encourage talks between the rival Myanmar sides, will meet in Indonesia on April 24 to discuss the situation, Thai and Indonesian media reported.

Junta leader Senior General Min Aung Hlaing was due to attend, a Thai broadcaster said, but the Jakarta Post said it had not been confirmed whether the summit would include representatives of the junta or the former government.

0,Iranian official admits Israel swiped nuclear archive,https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/iran-news/iranian-official-admits-israel-swiped-nuclear-archive-665257,"An adviser to Iran ’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Israel stole the country’s nuclear archive, in what appears to be the first public admission of the 2018 Mossad operation by an Iranian official.

Momeen Rezaei, secretary of the Expediency Discernment Council that reports directly to the supreme leader, told Iran’s Mehr News on Wednesday that the country needs a major revamp of its security.

“The country has been widely exposed to security violations, and the example is that in less than a year, three security incidents have occurred: two explosions and one assassination,” said Rezaei.

The two explosions took place at the Natanz nuclear site, first in July, taking out about three-fourths of the above-ground centrifuge assembly facility, and then on Sunday night, when the site’s electric grid and backup system were destroyed, along with large numbers of centrifuges. The assassination was of the head of Iran’s nuclear program, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, in November.

“Before this, documents from our entire nuclear [archive] have been stolen, and before that, a few suspicious drones came and did some work,” Rezaei added.

When the Mossad smuggled the nuclear archive out of Iran in 2018, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presenting evidence that the Islamic Republic aimed to develop a nuclear weapon, Iran denied that it was real. Iran nuclear negotiator Abbas Araghchi called it “a very childish and even a ridiculous play.” Mohammad Marandi, one of Iran’s negotiators in the 2015 nuclear deal, said Israel had “fabricated evidence.”

Rezaei said this week’s attack on Natanz was “a bad event in terms of prestige,” and that “they did it to break our resistance in diplomacy.”

The United States has ordered its non-essential staff in Chad to leave the African country as rebel fighters approached the capital on Sunday after early election results showed President Idriss Deby on course to extend his three-decade rule.

Deby, who seized power in 1990 at the head of an armed rebellion, is a staunch ally of France and the United States in the fight against Islamist militants in the arid Sahel region.

""Due to their growing proximity to N'Djamena and the possibility for violence in the city, non-essential U.S. government employees have been ordered to leave Chad by commercial airline,"" the U.S. state department said in a statement.

The British government on Saturday urged its citizens to leave because, it said, two armed convoys from the rebel Front for Change and Concord in Chad (FACT) were advancing towards the capital.

One convoy was seen approaching the town of Mao, about 220 km (137 miles) to the north of N'Djamena, it said.

Large numbers of heavily armed Chad security forces were patrolling the streets of the capital on Sunday morning, a Reuters witness said.

Chad's army said it had destroyed a rebel convoy in the north of Kanem province on Saturday afternoon.

""The column was totally decimated,"" army spokesman Azim Bermandoa Agouna said in a statement late on Saturday.

Partial provisional results have given Deby a strong lead in the April 11 poll despite signs of growing discontent over his handling of the nation's oil wealth.

Deby, one of Africa's longest-serving leaders, has successfully put down a string of rebellions since taking power, sometimes with military assistance from France.

French air strikes helped the Chad army to repel a rebel incursion from Libya in February 2019.

FACT, which is based on Chad's northern frontier in Libya, attacked a Chadian border post on the evening of April 11, just as polling stations were closing.

On Friday FACT said it had seized a garrison of Gouri in the country's north.

""The enemy, despite the logistical support of the French Air Force, was totally routed,"" FACT spokesman Kingabe Ogouzeimi de Tapol said in a statement posted on Facebook.

France's defence ministry on Sunday declined to comment on whether it was involved.

0,Europe has surpassed one million COVID-19 deaths: WHO,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/15/europe-has-surpassed-one-million-covid-19-deaths-who,"UN health agency warns of a ‘serious’ situation in the region as infections soar to record levels in some nations.

A top official from the World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday said Europe had surpassed one million deaths from COVID-19 and warned the situation remains “serious” in the region, with about 1.6 million new cases reported there each week.

The comments by WHO Regional Director for Europe Hans Kluge aimed to emphasise that Europe must keep up its guard with social distancing and speed up vaccinations as virus variants drive new infections to record levels in some nations.

Overall, a tally by Johns Hopkins University shows nearly three million deaths have been linked to COVID-19 worldwide – with the Americas hardest hit, followed by Europe. The United States, Brazil and Mexico have reported the highest number of deaths, collectively at more than 1.1 million.

Speaking to reporters during a visit to Greece, Kluge did point to “early signs that transmission may be slowing across several countries” in WHO’s 53-country European region, which stretches into Central Asia, and cited “declining incidence” among the oldest people.

He said the proportion of COVID-19 deaths among people over 80, who have been prioritised for vaccines, had dropped to nearly 30 percent – the lowest level in the pandemic.

The United Kingdom in particular has seen new infections and COVID-19 deaths drop dramatically since January, due to a successful vaccination program and a prolonged national lockdown that is only being reversed in stages.

Addressing recent concerns about vaccines, Kluge also said the risk of people suffering blood clots is far higher for people with COVID-19 than for people who receive AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine.

“Let there be no doubt about it, the AstraZeneca vaccine is effective in reducing COVID-19 hospitalisation and preventing deaths,” he said, adding that WHO recommends its use for all eligible adults.",309,1959,8,53
0,Colorful Coffins Lighten Mood at New Zealand Funerals,https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/colorful-coffins-lighten-mood-new-zealand-funerals,"WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND - When the pallbearers brought Phil McLean's coffin into the chapel, there were gasps before a wave of laughter rippled through the hundreds of mourners.

The coffin was a giant cream doughnut.

""It overshadowed the sadness and the hard times in the last few weeks,"" said his widow, Debra. ""The final memory in everyone's mind was of that doughnut, and Phil's sense of humor.""

The doughnut was the latest creation by Phil's cousin Ross Hall, who runs a business in Auckland, New Zealand, called Dying Art, which custom builds colorful coffins.

Other creations by Hall include a sailboat, a firetruck, a chocolate bar and Lego blocks. There have been glittering coffins covered in fake jewels, a casket inspired by the movie The Matrix, and plenty of coffins depicting people's favorite beaches and holiday spots.

""There are people who are happy with a brown mahogany box and that's great,"" said Hall. ""But if they want to shout it out, I'm here to do it for them.""

The idea first came to Hall about 15 years ago when he was writing a will and contemplating his own death.

""How do I want to go out?"" he thought to himself, deciding it wouldn't be like everyone else. ""So I put in my will that I want a red box with flames on it.""

Six months later, Hall, whose other business is a signage and graphics company, decided to get serious. He approached a few funeral directors who looked at him with interest and skepticism. But over time, the idea took hold.

Hall begins with special-made blank coffins and uses fiberboard and plywood to add details. A latex digital printer is used for the designs. Some orders are particularly complex, like the sailboat, which included a keel and rudder, cabin, sails, even metal railings and pulleys.

This photo provided by Ross Hall, shows caskets shaped as Lego and a space ship in Auckland, New Zealand, on Feb 25, 2021. (Ross Hall via AP)

Depending on the design, the coffins retail for between about 3,000 and 7,500 New Zealand dollars ($2,100 and $5,400).

Hall said the tone of funerals has changed markedly over recent years.

""People now think it's a celebration of life rather than a mourning of death,"" he said. And they've been willing to throw out stuffy conventions in favor of getting something unique.

But a doughnut?

Debra McLean said she and her late husband, who was 68 when he died in February, used to tour the country in their motorhome, and Phil loved comparing cream doughnuts in every small town, considering himself something of a connoisseur.

He considered a good doughnut one that was crunchy on the outside, airy in the middle, and definitely made with fresh cream.

This photo provided by Ross Hall shows a cream doughnut-shaped coffin for the funeral of Phil McLean outside a church in Tauranga, New Zealand, on Feb 17, 2021. (Ross Hall via AP)

After Phil was diagnosed with bowel cancer, he had time to think about his funeral and, along with his wife and cousin, came up with the idea for the doughnut coffin. Debra said they even had 150 doughnuts delivered to the funeral in Tauranga from Phil's favorite bakery in Whitianga, more than 160 kilometers away.

Hall said his coffins are biodegradable and are usually buried or cremated along with the deceased. The only one he's ever gotten back is his cousin's, he said, because he used polystyrene and shaping foam, which is not environmentally friendly.

Phil was switched to a plain coffin for his cremation, and Hall said he'll keep the doughnut coffin forever. For now, it remains in the back of his white 1991 Cadillac hearse.

As for his own funeral? Hall said he's changed his mind about those red flames. He's emailed his kids saying he wants to be buried in a clear coffin wearing nothing but a leopard-pattern G-string.

""The kids say they're not going,"" he said with a laugh.",664,3839,8,53
0,Angela Merkel gets her AstraZeneca COVID vaccine shot,https://www.dw.com/en/angelamerkel-gets-her-astrazeneca-covid-vaccine-shot/a-57222191,"Unlike many other world leaders, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has not made much of a fuss about the fact that she has now been vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine, made by a British-Swedish manufacturer.

The 66-year-old chancellor received the vaccine at the specially installed center in Berlin's former Tempelhof Airport, which is currently working exclusively with AstraZeneca, a vaccine that is only available to the over-60s in Germany, because of a marginal risk of blood clots. Around 3,000 people a day can currently receive a vaccination there.

The vaccination was announced by her spokesman Steffen Seibert in a post on Twitter, with a simple photo showing her only her vaccination certificate.

Merkel said: ""I am delighted to have received my first vaccination today with AstraZeneca. I thank everyone who is involved in the vaccination campaign — and everyone who gets vaccinated. Vaccination is the key to overcoming the pandemic.""

Waiting her turn

Several times in recent weeks, the chancellor had been forced to answer the question of when she would be getting herself injected, and whether she would be taking AstraZeneca. Her response was always the same: ""When it's my turn, I'll get vaccinated, including with AstraZeneca."" She clearly knows what a sensitive issue the vaccination queue is, especially in Germany.

Politicians in Germany have taken pains to avoid coming across as queue-jumpers, even if there's no reason why they shouldn't be allowed it — as in the case of the chancellor.

German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier also avoided fanfare when he was vaccinated at the beginning of April at a military hospital in Berlin: His office merely issued a photo and a press release, which confirmed that he too had been given the AstraZeneca.

""I trust the vaccines approved in Germany,"" the 65-year-old Steinmeier was quoted as saying. ""Vaccination is a decisive step on the way out of the pandemic. Take advantage of the opportunities, join in.""

In Baden-Württemberg's 72-year-old Premier Winfried Kretschmann, of the Green Party, is so far one of the few German politicians who allowed TV cameras to be used when he was vaccinated in March. He also received the AstraZeneca vaccine and hastened to add that he had confidence in its effectiveness.

AstraZeneca now only for people over 60

Initially, the vaccine from the British-Swedish manufacturer AstraZeneca had only been approved for people under 60 because there was not enough data available for older people in the trials.

But then, a few disturbing reports of isolated incidents of brain thrombosis in vaccinated people, especially among younger women, emerged, and now AstraZeneca is only dispensed to people over the age of 60.

In this context, the chancellor's vaccination was meant as a signal that she continues to back this vaccine despite uncertainties.

At the same time, she is well aware of how quickly debates can arise about whether politicians are using their influence to secure privileges. At the start of the vaccination campaign in December 2020, there were reports of some local politicians who had a vaccine administered ahead of schedule. Bernd Wiegand, mayor of the city of Halle in Saxony-Anhalt, for example, found himself suspended from office after he had himself vaccinated prematurely.

More media attention elsewhere

In other countries, political leaders are much more demonstrative about their own vaccination than Merkel. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had himself vaccinated in March to great media attention, after a spell in hospital with COVID-19 last year.

And new US President Joe Biden, 78, wasn't even in office when he got his COVID vaccination in front of rolling cameras at a hospital in the state of Delaware in December 2020 — though he declined the offer to count to three before the needle of the syringe entered his upper arm.

Merkel appeals to Bundestag for 'emergency brake'

Earlier on Friday, Merkel pleaded with lawmakers to back her in implementing coronavirus lockdowns and curfews on areas with high infection rates.

""The third wave of the pandemic has our country firmly in its grip,"" Merkel said, whose speech was heckled by lawmakers from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The AfD have maintained an anti-lockdown stance throughout the pandemic.

But Merkel said: ""Intensive care workers are sending one distress call after the other. Who are we to ignore their pleas?""

0,Raul Castro resigns as head of Cuba's Communist Party,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/raul-castro-resigns-head-cuba-communist-party/,"Raul Castro said Friday he is resigning as head of Cuba's Communist Party, ending an era of leadership that began with his brother Fidel and the country's 1959 revolution. The 89-year-old Castro made the announcement in a speech at the opening of the eighth Congress of the ruling party, the only one allowed on the island.

He said he was retiring with the sense of having ""fulfilled his mission and confident in the future of the fatherland.""

""Nothing, nothing, nothing is forcing me to make this decision,"" Castro said in his speech to the closed Congress, part of which was aired on state television. ""As long as I live I will be ready with my foot in the stirrup to defend the homeland, the revolution and socialism with more force than ever.""

Castro didn't say who he would endorse as his successor as first secretary of the Communist Party. But he previously indicated he favors yielding control to 60-year-old Miguel Díaz-Canel, who succeeded him as president in 2018 and is the standard bearer of a younger generation of loyalists who have been pushing an economic opening without touching Cuba's one-party system.

Photographs released by the official Cuban News Agency showed Castro, dressed in an olive green uniform, entering the compound with Díaz-Canel by his side.

Castro's retirement means that for the first time in more than six decades, Cubans won't have a Castro formally guiding their affairs. Many had been expecting the change.

""One has to step aside for the young people,"" said 64-year-old retiree Juana Busutil, for whom Castro ""is going to continue being the leader.""

The transition comes at a difficult time for Cuba, with many on the island anxious about what lies ahead.

The coronavirus pandemic, painful financial reforms and restrictions imposed by the Trump administration have battered the economy, which shrank 11% last year as a result of a collapse in tourism and remittances. Long food lines and shortages have brought back echoes of the ""special period"" that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s.

Discontent has been fueled by the spread of the internet and growing inequality. Much of the debate inside Cuba is focused on the pace of reform, with many complaining that the so-called ""historic generation"" represented by Castro has been too slow to open the economy.

In January, Díaz-Canel finally pulled the trigger on a plan approved two congresses ago to unify the island's dual currency system, giving rise to fears of inflation. He also threw the doors open to a broader range of private enterprise — a category long banned or tightly restricted — permitting Cubans to legally operate many sorts of self-run businesses from their homes.

This year's Congress is expected to focus on unfinished reforms to overhaul state-run enterprises, attracting foreign investment and providing more legal protection to private business activities.

The Communist Party is made up of 700,000 activists and is tasked in Cuba's constitution with directing the affairs of the nation and society.

Fidel Castro, who led the revolution that drove dictator Fulgencio Batista from power in 1959, formally became head of the party in 1965, about four years after officially embracing socialism.

He quickly absorbed the old party under his control and was the country's unquestioned leader until falling ill in 2006. In 2008, he handed over the presidency to his younger brother Raul, who had fought alongside him during the revolution.

Raul succeeded him as head of the party in 2011. Fidel Castro died in 2016.

For most of his life, Raul played second-string to his brother Fidel — first as a guerrilla commander, later as a senior figure in their socialist government. But for the past decade, it's Raul who has been the face of communist Cuba and its defiance of U.S. efforts to oust its socialist system.

The fourth of seven children of a Spanish immigrant in eastern Cuba, Raul had joined his charismatic older brother in a nearly suicidal attack on the Moncada military barracks in the eastern city of Santiago in 1953 and survived the crackdown that followed from the forces of Batista.

He led a major front in the ensuing guerrilla war led by Fidel that toppled Batista, and later served as head of the armed forces. For many years, he was considered a more orthodox communist than his brother.

But it was Raul who reached accords with U.S. President Barack Obama in 2014 that created the most extensive U.S. opening to Cuba since the early 1960s — creating a surge in contacts with the United States that was largely reversed under Obama's successor, Donald Trump.

Now, with Raul Castro stepping down as party leader amid change and challenges, some say the island needs continuity going forward.

""All process have a continuity and I think Díaz-Canel should be there now,"" said 58-year-old driver Miguel Rodríguez.",809,4885,9,53
0,How the Kremlin provides a safe harbor for ransomware,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/kremlin-provides-safe-harbor-ransomware-rcna699,"A global epidemic of digital extortion known as ransomware is crippling local governments, hospitals, school districts and businesses by scrambling their data files until they pay up. Law enforcement has been largely powerless to stop it.

One big reason: Ransomware rackets are dominated by Russian-speaking cybercriminals who are shielded — and sometimes employed — by Russian intelligence agencies, according to security researchers, U.S. law enforcement, and now the Biden administration.

On Thursday, as the U.S. slapped sanctions on Russia for malign activities including state-backed hacking, the Treasury Department said Russian intelligence has enabled ransomware attacks by cultivating and co-opting criminal hackers and giving them safe harbor. With ransomware damages now well into the tens of billions of dollars, former British intelligence cyber chief Marcus Willett recently deemed the scourge “arguably more strategically damaging than state cyber-spying.”

The value of Kremlin protection isn’t lost on the cybercriminals themselves. Earlier this year, a Russian-language dark-web forum lit up with criticism of a ransomware purveyor known only as “Bugatti,” whose gang had been caught in a rare U.S.-Europol sting. The assembled posters accused him of inviting the crackdown with technical sloppiness and by recruiting non-Russian affiliates who might be snitches or undercover cops.

Worst of all, in the view of one long-active forum member, Bugatti had allowed Western authorities to seize ransomware servers that could have been sheltered in Russia instead. “Mother Russia will help,” that individual wrote. “Love your country and nothing will happen to you.” The conversation was captured by the security firm Advanced Intelligence, which shared it with the Associated Press.

“Like almost any major industry in Russia, (cybercriminals) work kind of with the tacit consent and sometimes explicit consent of the security services,” said Michael van Landingham, a former CIA analyst who runs the consultancy Active Measures LLC.

Russian authorities have a simple rule, said Karen Kazaryan, CEO of the software industry-supported Internet Research Institute in Moscow: “Just don’t ever work against your country and businesses in this country. If you steal something from Americans, that’s fine.”

Unlike North Korea, there is no indication Russia’s government benefits directly from ransomware crime, although Russian President Vladimir Putin may consider the resulting havoc a strategic bonus.

In the U.S. alone last year, ransomware struck more than a hundred federal, state and municipal agencies, upward of 500 hospitals and other health care centers, some 1,680 schools, colleges and universities and hundreds of businesses, according to t he cybersecurity firm Emsisoft.

Damage in the public sector alone is measured in rerouted ambulances, postponed cancer treatments, interrupted municipal bill collection, canceled classes and rising insurance costs – all during the worst public health crisis in more than a century.

The idea behind these attacks is simple: Criminals infiltrate malicious data-scrambling software into computer networks, use it to “kidnap” an organization’s data files, then demand huge payments, now as high as $50 million, to restore them. The latest twist: if victims fail to pay up, the criminals may publish their unscrambled data on the open internet.

In recent months, U.S. law enforcement has worked with partners including Ukraine and Bulgaria to bust up these networks. But with the criminal masterminds out of reach, such operations are generally little more than whac-a-mole.

Collusion between criminals and the government is nothing new in Russia, said Adam Hickey, a U.S. deputy assistant attorney general, who noted that cybercrime can provide good cover for espionage.

Back in the 1990s, Russian intelligence frequently recruited hackers for that purpose, said Kazaryan. Now, he said, ransomware criminals are just as likely to be moonlighting state-employed hackers.

The Kremlin sometimes enlists arrested criminal hackers by offering them a choice between prison and working for the state, said Dmitri Alperovitch, former chief technical officer of the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike. Sometimes the hackers use the same computer systems for state-sanctioned hacking and off-the-clock cybercrime for personal enrichment, he said. They may even mix state with personal business.

That’s what happened in a 2014 hack of Yahoo that compromised more than 500 million user accounts, allegedly including those of Russian journalists and U.S. and Russian government officials. A U.S. investigation led to the 2017 indictment of four men, including two officers of Russia’s FSB security service – a successor to the KGB. One of them, Dmitry Dokuchaev, worked in the same FSB office that cooperates with the FBI on computer crime. Another defendant, Alexsey Belan, allegedly used the hack for personal gain.

A Russian Embassy spokesman declined to address questions about his government’s alleged ties to ransomware criminals and state employees’ alleged involvement in cybercrime. “We do not comment on any indictments or rumors,” said Anton Azizov, the deputy press attache in Washington.

Proving links between the Russian state and ransomware gangs is not easy. The criminals hide behind pseudonyms and periodically change the names of their malware strains to confuse Western law enforcement.

But at least one ransomware purveyor has been linked to the Kremlin. Maksim Yakubets, 33, is best known as co-leader of a cybergang that cockily calls itself Evil Corp. The Ukraine-born Yakubets lives a flashy lifestyle, He drives a customized Lamborghini supercar with a personalized number plate that translates to ‘Thief,’ according to Britain’s National Crime Agency.

Yakubets started working for the FSB in 2017, tasked with projects including “acquiring confidential documents through cyber-enabled means and conducting cyber-enabled operations on its behalf,” according to a December 2019 U.S. indictment. At the same time, the U.S. Treasury Department slapped sanctions on Yakubets and offered a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture. It said he was known to have been “in the process of obtaining a license to work with Russian classified information from the FSB.”

The indictment charged Evil Corp. with developing and distributing ransomware used to steal at least $100 million in more than 40 countries over the previous decade, including payrolls pilfered from towns in the American heartland.

By the time Yakubets was indicted, Evil Corp. had become a major ransomware player, security researchers say. By May 2020, the gang was distributing a ransomware strain that was used to attack eight Fortune 500 companies, including the GPS device maker Garmin, whose network was offline for days after an attack, according to Advanced Intelligence.

Yakubets remains at large. Another Russian currently imprisoned in France, however, might offer more insight into the dealings of cybercriminals and the Russian state. Alexander Vinnik was convicted of laundering $160 million in criminal proceeds through a cryptocurrency exchange called BTC-e. A 2017 U.S. indictment charged that “some of the largest known purveyors of ransomware” actually used it to launder $4 billion. But Vinnik can’t be extradited until he completes his 5-year French prison sentence in 2024.

Still, a 2018 study by the nonpartisan think tank Third Way found the odds of successfully prosecuting authors of cyberattacks against U.S. targets — ransomware and online bank theft are the costliest — are no better than three in a thousand. Experts say that those odds have gotten longer.

This week’s sanctions send a strong message, but aren’t likely to deter Putin unless the financial sting hits closer to home, many analysts believe.

That might require the kind of massive multinational coordination that followed the 9/11 terror attacks. For instance, allied countries could identify banking institutions known to launder ransomware proceeds and cut them off from the global financial community.

“If you’re able to follow the money and disrupt the money and take the economic incentive out, that’ll go a long way in stopping ransomware attacks,” said John Riggi, cybersecurity advisor for the American Hospital Association and a former FBI official.",1263,8421,9,53

0,Xinjiang cotton boycott leaves Western brands reeling,https://www.dw.com/en/xinjiang-cotton-boycott-leaves-western-brands-reeling/a-57130450,"The latest China-versus-the-West dispute is getting ugly. On Wednesday, Chinese state television started blurring the names of Western brands worn by reality show contestants. The measure was a veiled threat to the likes of Adidas and Nike that they could easily lose access to the world's largest consumer market of 1.4 billion people.

Why? The brands have taken a stand on the sourcing of apparel made with cotton produced in China's western Xinjiang region. Human rights groups allege that the fiber is picked using forced labor by the country's Uyghur Muslim population.

They accuse China of holding up to 1 million Uyghurs in internment camps, which prompted Western sanctions on Chinese officials and new US legislation, enacted in January, that limits the import of Xinjiang cotton. Beijing, however, insists the camps are vocational training centers needed to fight extremism.

H&M, Nike feel the heat

The world's second-largest clothing retailer, H&M, was among the first to be caught in the fray. Amid accusations that it was profiting from modern-day slavery, the Swedish multinational promised last year to stop buying cotton from Xinjiang.

But it now faces a backlash from Chinese consumers who threatened their own boycott of H&M products. Nike, Adidas and Hugo Boss have also been targeted on social media and several Chinese celebrities have cut ties with Western brands.

""The backlash is driven by nationalist sentiment, amplified by Chinese state media, and is being used to retaliate against increasing international scrutiny on the genocide that is happening in Xinjiang,"" Johnson Yeung, urgent appeal coordinator for Clean Clothes Campaign East Asia told DW. He noted that social media is heavily controlled and censored by the Chinese government.

Indeed, the Biden administration last month denounced what it said was Beijing's ""state-led social media campaign and corporate and consumer boycott against companies.""

Beijing has warned foreign companies against interfering in its domestic affairs

Principles over profit?

The same brands that have won support among Western consumers in recent years for taking a stand on social issues, like equality and human rights, are now up against more hardline belief-based buyers in China, who see the cotton boycott as threatening the country's reputation.

China — already an important market for many international brands — is set to become even more critical to their bottom line. Domestic Chinese consumption is expected to double by 2030, according to Morgan Stanley, to reach $12.7 trillion (€10.7 trillion) — roughly the same as US consumers spend today. So Western brands may have to walk a thin line to appease both sides in this dispute. And that's led to rather contradictory messaging from some retailers.

German fashion brand Hugo Boss insists on its corporate website that it doesn't buy any goods directly from Xinjiang. However, on the Weibo social media platform, the firm told Chinese consumers that ""Xinjiang long cotton is one of the best in the world, we believe quality raw materials would show its value. We will continue to buy and support Xinjiang cotton."" The message was later deleted.

H&M, meanwhile, facing the removal of its productions from Chinese e-commerce platforms, was forced to downplay its criticism of Beijing's treatment of Uyghur Muslims. In a recent statement, it declared that China was a ""very important market"" and vowed to ""regain the trust and confidence"" of customers, colleagues, and business partners in the country.

Beijing turns the screws

This is not the first time that China has pressured foreign brands to conform to its position on sensitive issues. Western fashion firms and automakers were forced to apologize two years ago for implying that Hong Kong and Taiwan are independent countries.

Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997 by colonial ruler Britain under the one country, two systems model, while Beijing sees Taiwan as its territory. Other brands have run into similar trouble for remarks about Tibet.

To date, sanctions by the United States, the European Union and the UK on Chinese officials over human rights abuses against the Uyghurs have only spurred tit-for-tat measures from Beijing. China this week threatened Japan and Australia with retaliation if they join other countries in imposing punitive measures.

China, meanwhile, has warned multinational firms not to engage in politics over Xinjiang. Xu Guixiang, a Xinjiang government spokesman, said their interference was ""like lifting a stone to drop it on one's own feet.""

H&M and others have been pilloried in China for statements voicing concern about allegations of forced labor

Opaque supply chains

The New York Times reported Tuesday that while many retailers had vowed to stop using Xinjiang cotton, their promises might be difficult to uphold.

China exports unprocessed cotton to more than a dozen countries, including the world's other biggest apparel producers. The newspaper described how the Chinese government restricted access to supply chains in its far-western region, which would likely hamper efforts for auditors to ensure that products were free of Xinjiang-sourced cotton.

Yeung from Clean Clothes Campaign East Asia told DW that a successful Western boycott relied on apparel producers' ""willingness to eradicate forced labor."" He pointed to Dutch clothing brand We Fashion that he said had committed to ending the use of Xinjiang cotton, although the company did not have stores in China. British retailer M&S had also backed the call to stop forced labor, he said.

""Given the intense authoritarian control in China, we have to maintain the pressure for a long time,"" he conceded.",899,5716,7,53
0,'Made of plastic': Cleaning up Bolivia's Uru Uru lake,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bolivia-environment-idUSKBN2BV2CO,"URU URU LAKE, Bolivia (Reuters) - Bolivia’s Uru Uru lake is more plastic than water, with discarded bottles, containers, toys and tires stretching out towards the horizon, a dystopian image reflecting years of human pollution and the scar of climate change.

The highland lake in the Oruro Department of western Bolivia suffered a major drought in 2016 that drastically lowered its water levels while rivers that flow into it have deposited mountains of plastic waste in its waters over years.

Local volunteers, workers and even a French ‘influencer’ are trying to clear up the mess. On Wednesday hundreds of people gathered up waste from the surface of the lake, whose waters have also been contaminated by nearby industry and mining.

“We are at this moment in a garbage dump, which we have caused since we are the destroyers of the planet,” volunteer Magali Huarachi, 28, told Reuters standing amid plastic bottles on a dried out part of the lake.

“I am now in a lake, but made of plastic.”

Bolivia’s highland lakes are major sites protected under the international Ramsar Convention to conserve wetlands, especially those providing waterfowl habitat. The iconic Lake Titicaca is grappling with pollution and the expansion of cities near its shoreline, while Lago Poopó, formerly the second largest after Titicaca, dried up completely in 2015.

Limbert Sanchez, from the Center for Ecology and Indigenous Peoples (CEPA), said Uru Uru’s water levels had been reduced to around 25-30% of its full capacity, while it had been hit hard by urban and mining pollution.

“Cities are growing, pollution by garbage is growing and gradually that means our Lake Uru Uru is dying, just like our Lake Poopó,” he said.

Alex Dessard, a French social media influencer who helped clean up Bolivia’s famed ‘train cemetery’ on the salt flats of Uyuni, was one of many cleaning up Uru Uru on Wednesday, pulling out tires and other plastic from blackened water.

“It’s a shame that so much garbage has come here because it has accumulated in many years, perhaps a decade. Now we have to think about the future. Let’s clean and then we become aware so that we don’t have to clean again,” he said.

As front loaders and dump trucks hauled away the mountains of rubbish, volunteer Huarachi held out hope.

“I think that if we all do our little bit, by picking up our garbage or coming to help here, then we are going to make this place beautiful in a while,” she said.",422,2475,9,53
0,The man who made Fords great to drive has passed away,https://www.topgear.com/car-news/man-who-made-fords-great-drive-has-passed-away,"Richard Parry-Jones, the engineer responsible more than any other for the driving excellence of 21st-century Fords, has died aged 69.

The news has sent shockwaves round an industry where his influence had spread hugely. And where he wasn’t only admired but held in deep affection by everyone who knew him. He was killed in an accident on the farm in Wales where he’d retired.

Parry-Jones was a brilliant dynamics engineer, a superb communicator, a motorsports fan and an early advocate for the need for the car industry to reduce CO2. His working life is a demonstration of how one individual really can have an influence over this whole colossal industry.

The man known to all as RP-J was a Ford lifer, having joined as an apprentice. His first big hit was as chief engineer of the Mondeo, launched in 1992. This was a huge programme: Ford spent about £5bn (in 1995 money) on the Mondeo and its American equivalents the Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique.

Previous to that car, Ford’s engineering effort – and it was very well executed - was all about saving money. If in consequence the car’s ride was lumpy and the engine rough and the steering slack, well that was tough luck: they were profitable cars to manufacture and sell.

With the Mondeo, Parry-Jones shifted Ford’s course. He reckoned there would be more money to be made by building better cars that would sell in higher numbers at higher prices. He sweated every detail of the engineering in search of improvements in dynamics and refinement.

You’d be driving with him and he’d say things like, ‘see, we’ve changed the compliance in the steering rack bushes. The customer can feel it you know’. He was passionate, and a brilliant communicator.

It’s a rather awful irony that within weeks of Ford’s announcement that the Mondeo will be no more, we also lose the man that made it.

After that Mondeo, he led on the Fiesta, a vast improvement on what went before, and the lovely Puma coupe. Then the 1998 Focus, a radically designed and brilliant-driving hatch, night and day better than the Escort. All spawned wonderful hot versions too.

At that point he was promoted to Detroit to head all Ford’s engineering and design worldwide. He admitted to being pretty shocked at some of the US metal he had to deal with. Even the dominant F-150 pickup.

He was also in charge of engineering for all the vehicles under the FoMoCo umbrella, including, at the time, Jaguar Land Rover, Volvo, Mazda, Lincoln and Aston Martin. He returned to the board of Aston recently.

In his day, he’d been a very competitive rally driver. But he wasn’t just about cars going at maximum-hoon. (Though he was also about that; I among many others have had to ask him to stop a road car he was driving so I could get out and chunder.)

No, he mainly wanted his cars to be satisfying at ordinary speeds to ordinary drivers. The progression of the steering, the refinement of the ride, the brake feel at gentle stops. His cars just felt right, even to drivers who had no idea why.

He didn’t just operate by instinct. One of his great contributions was to develop a series of metrics, input-output graphs that could be recorded by sensors attached to prototypes. These fed into a digital model of what a Ford should feel like. This was propagated throughout the company to be used by engineers in multiple different places and times.

He was also a brilliant developer of talent, mentoring a generation of engineers inside the Ford Group. Others who worked for him went on to do great things elsewhere. Prominently, Uli Eichhorn worked with him on the Focus, and was recruited by VW. He made sure his Mk5 Golf got Focus-like suspension, before moving on to Bentley before becoming chief engineer of the whole VW Group.

So although RPJ retired in 2007, his influence reverberates across Ford, and in companies such as JLR and Volvo that are no longer part of Ford, and in companies entirely beyond Ford.

Actually, it basically went through the whole industry because nearly every European mainstream company had to polish its dynamics game to have a hope of keeping up with his late-90s cars.

He also pushed Ford’s motorsport involvement, and brought in Malcolm Wilson to make the WRC team a success at the turn of the century.

After he retired, he served on several important industry boards, and advised the UK and Welsh Governments on auto, energy and industrial policy. He was chair of Network Rail for three years, too.

In all of this, he was a strikingly insightful thinker and wonderfully expressive communicator, as well as stimulating company who’d always give you a new way of looking at something. And a witty bon viveur. He once called for a final round of drinks at an off-site event, to be told by the waiter, ‘sorry sir, we’re now serving breakfast’.

He will be greatly missed by so many in his beloved Wales and far beyond. To his family and friends we send our best wishes.",859,4933,11,53

British health officials are investigating a COVID-19 variant originating in India but as yet they do not have enough evidence to classify it is as a variant of concern, Susan Hopkins of Public Health England (PHE) said on Sunday.

Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show on BBC television, Hopkins said: ""We have not got enough data about this variant yet to be able to clarify whether it's a variant of concern. We have put it as a variant under investigation.""

""To escalate it up the ranking we need to know that it's increased transmissibility, increased severity, or vaccine-evading, and we just don't have that yet, but we're looking at the data on a daily basis.""

PHE has said it has identified 77 cases of the variant in Britain.

Earlier, environment minister George Eustice said Prime Minister Boris Johnson's trip to India later this month should go ahead despite rising cases in the country.

""It is important that business and the business of politics if you like does continue,"" he said, adding that an expert committee periodically reviews decisions about whether to permit travel to certain countries.

The cause of the accident is being investigated, it added.

More than 50 ambulances took the injured to three hospitals in the province, the health ministry said.

The derailing is the latest of several recent railway crashes in Egypt.

At least 20 people were killed and nearly 200 were injured in March when two trains collided near Tahta, about 440km south of Cairo.

Fifteen people were injured this month when two train carriages derailed near Minya al-Qamh city, about 70km north of Cairo.

Egypt’s transportation minister Kamel El-Wazir, a former army general, has faced calls to resign from some Egyptians on social media. He has rejected these and vowed to keep working on developing the ageing rail network.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Former Officer Derek Chauvin chose not to take the stand as testimony at his murder trial ended Thursday, passing up the chance to explain to the jury and the public for the first time what he was thinking when he pressed his knee against George Floyd’s neck.

Closing arguments are set to begin Monday, after which a racially diverse jury will begin deliberating at a barbed-wire-ringed courthouse in a city on edge — not just because of the Chauvin case but because of the deadly police shooting of a 20-year-old Black man in a Minneapolis suburb last weekend.

Before the jury was brought in Thursday morning, Chauvin, his COVID-19 mask removed in a rare courtroom moment, ended weeks of speculation by informing the judge he would invoke his Fifth Amendment right not to testify.

Shortly afterward, the defense rested its case, after a total of two days of testimony, compared with two weeks for the prosecution.

Judge Peter Cahill reminded the jurors they will be sequestered starting Monday and said: “If I were you, I would plan for long and hope for short.”

Chauvin, 45, is charged with murder and manslaughter in Floyd’s death after the 46-year-old Black man was arrested on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 at a neighborhood market last May.

Bystander video of Floyd gasping that he couldn’t breathe as bystanders yelled at Chauvin to get off him triggered worldwide protests, violence and a furious examination of racism and policing in the U.S.

The most serious charge against the now-fired white officer, second-degree murder, carries up to 40 years in prison, though state guidelines call for about 12.

Prosecutors say Floyd died because the officer’s knee was pressed against Floyd’s neck or close to it for 9 1/2 minutes as he lay on the pavement on his stomach, his hands cuffed behind him and his face jammed against the ground.

Law enforcement veterans inside and outside the Minneapolis department testified for the prosecution that Chauvin used excessive force and went against his training, while medical experts said Floyd died of asphyxia, or lack of oxygen, because his breathing was constricted by the way he was held down.

Chauvin attorney Eric Nelson called a police use-of-force expert and a forensic pathologist to help make the case that Chauvin acted reasonably against a struggling suspect and that Floyd died because of an underlying heart condition and his illegal drug use. Floyd had high blood pressure and narrowed arteries, and fentanyl and methamphetamine were found in his system.

The only time Chauvin has been heard defending himself was when the jury listened to body-camera footage from the scene. After an ambulance had taken Floyd away, Chauvin told a bystander: “We gotta control this guy ’cause he’s a sizable guy ... and it looks like he’s probably on something.”

The decision of whether Chauvin should testify carried risks either way.

Taking the stand could have opened him up to devastating cross-examination, with prosecutors replaying the video of the arrest and forcing Chauvin to explain, one frame at a time, why he kept pressing down on Floyd.

But testifying could have also given the jury the opportunity to look at his unmasked face and see or hear any remorse or sympathy he might feel.

Also, what was going through Chauvin’s mind could be crucial: Legal experts say that an officer who believes his or her life was at risk can be found to have acted legally even if, in hindsight, it turns out there was no such danger.

In one final bit of testimony on Thursday, the prosecution briefly recalled a lung and critical care expert to knock down a defense witness’ theory that carbon monoxide poisoning from a squad car’s exhaust might have contributed to Floyd’s death. Dr. Martin Tobin noted hospital tests that showed Floyd’s level was at most 2%, within the normal range.

With the trial in session, Minneapolis has been bracing for a possible repeat of the protests and violence that broke out last spring over Floyd’s death.

The case has unfolded amid days of protests in the adjoining suburb of Brooklyn Center, after Officer Kim Potter, who is white, apparently mistook her gun for a Taser and fatally shot Daunte Wright. She resigned and was charged with manslaughter.

A future where buses, trains, trucks, cars, home heating and farm machinery run on zero emission hydrogen fuel – that’s all part of the new hydrogen hub vision unveiled on Wednesday (14th April) for Edmonton, Canada.

Thought to be Canada’s first hydrogen hub, the vision for Edmonton has been backed by $1.2m in funding from Western Economic Diversification Canada (WD), $600,000 from Alberta’s Industrial Heartland Association and $450,000 from the Province of Alberta.

Such funds will help kickstart Edmonton Region’s low-carbon hydrogen economy, ushering in a wave of clean energy jobs and ensuring a strong economic future as the world shifts towards a greener future.

The hub represents an early hydrogen deployment hub as outlined in the Canadian Hydrogen Strategy and will serve as a blueprint of how to accelerate a strong regional hydrogen economy that can be replicated in other regions across the country with low-cost, low-carbon hydrogen.

With support from the Transition Accelerator, planning for the hub is underway for over 25 potential projects related to the supply, delivery and use of low-carbon hydrogen. Potential projects include the use of hydrogen for municipal and commercial vehicle fleets and home and industrial heat and power.

Welcoming the plans, the Honourable Jim Carr, Special Representative for the Prairies, said, “This investment to launch the Edmonton Region Hydrogen hub to accelerate the production and distribution of hydrogen fuel is part of our government’s Hydrogen Strategy and will help us achieve our goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.”

“Today’s announcement demonstrates how our government is committed to investing in the economy, creating jobs and supporting our energy workers.”

A final report released by Alberta’s Industrial Heartland Hydrogen Task Force outlined that Canadian hydrogen has a wholesale market potential of up to $100bn a year and identified the Edmonton Region as the best launch point for a pan-Canadian hydrogen economy[1].

Read more: Alberta’s Industrial Heartland Hydrogen Task Force details steps to a hydrogen-fuelled future

According to the report, the region is well-positioned for success because it has one of the lowest hydrogen production costs in the world, existing experience in hydrogen production, a vast network of pipeline infrastructure, and suitable and existing sites for carbon capture, utilisation and storage which are necessary to upgrade natural gas into hydrogen for use as a low-carbon fuel.

The report also found that the best way to quickly achieve sufficient scale for a strong Canada-wide hydrogen economy is through the creation and deliberate connection of regional hydrogen hubs across the country.

“Hydrogen has the potential to be not just a key part of the world’s cleaner energy future, but the future of Alberta’s dynamic energy industry. The launch of the Edmonton Region Hydrogen HUB is a critical step towards building that future by establishing the local connections which will pave the way for provincial, national, and international networks in the years to come,” said Dale Nally, Associate Minister of Natural Gas and Electricity, Government of Alberta.

“The Government of Alberta is proud to be a partner in the development of this first Canadian hub and we look forward to continuing our partnership with The Transition Accelerator, other levels of government, and industry as the hydrogen economy continues to gather momentum.”

“Achieving the low-carbon economy required of us will be a challenge; the hydrogen HUB checks all the boxes representing solutions to this challenge including: practical use of our current energy sector infrastructure and resources, the opportunity to be a global leader in an emerging industry, and the local unprecedented collaboration needed to achieve our ambitions,” added William Morin, Vice-Chair, Edmonton Region Hydrogen hub and Chief, Enoch Cree Nation.

Following the launch of Canada’s Hydrogen Strategy late last year, H2 View sat down with Sabina Russell, Zen Clean Energy Solutions’ Principal and co-author of the strategy. Speaking to Russell in exclusively, H2 View discussed why Canada’s time for hydrogen has come, what plans have been unveiled under the strategy and the country’s hopes for the future.

0,Navalny Ally Jailed 2 Years for Anti-Government Tweets,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/04/16/navalny-ally-jailed-2-years-for-tweets-inciting-extremism-mediazona-a73626,"Pavel Zelensky, a camera operator for Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK), was detained in January on charges of inciting extremism online. The accusations stem from anti-government tweets he posted after the self-immolation death of journalist Irina Slavina after police searches at her apartment in October.

A Moscow court has sentenced one of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny’s allies to two years in prison for two tweets critical of the Russian government, the Mediazona news website reported Thursday.

Moscow’s Tushinsky District Court found Zelensky guilty of incitement and sentenced him to two years in a penal colony, according to the Mediazona independent news website.

The state prosecution had reportedly requested a 2.5-year sentence for Zelensky.

Zelensky's wife told the Open Media news website that he plans to appeal the verdict.

Mediazona reported that Zelensky had pleaded guilty, with other Navalny allies speculating that officials may have subjected him to physical and psychological pressure to do so. Zelensky's wife had told Mediazona in February that he pleaded guilty in hopes of mitigating his sentence after he learned his mother was sick with the coronavirus.

The outlet added that Interior Ministry experts found signs of extremism in Zelensky’s tweets, one of which called for readers to take to the streets to express their anger.

Navalny and FBK have been a constant thorn in the side of Russian officials, several of whom have found themselves the subjects of the group's popular video investigations alleging high-level corruption. Several Navalny allies are under house arrest on charges of violating coronavirus restrictions for urging protests calling for Navalny’s release earlier this year.

Rights groups have accused Russia of applying the extremist label to opposition material as it increasingly criminalized online content in recent years.

Navalny, 44, is serving two and a half years in a notorious prison colony on charges of violating parole of his old suspended sentence for fraud. He is currently on hunger strike to demand proper medical treatment.

Navalny accuses the Kremlin of ordering his poisoning attack with the Novichok nerve agent last August. The Kremlin rejects the accusations and says there are no grounds to investigate Navalny’s poisoning.",354,2327,8,54
0,Russian envoy says ‘there is no famine’ in North Korea,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/15/russian-envoy-says-there-is-no-famine-in-north-korea,"Ambassador’s comments come days after Kim Jong Un said North Korea was facing its ‘worst-ever situation’.

The Russian ambassador in Pyongyang has described life as difficult in North Korea because of a halt in foreign trade amid international sanctions and coronavirus-linked border closures, but said there was no famine in the isolated and impoverished country.

Alexander Matsegora’s comments, published by Russia’s TASS news agency on Wednesday, came days after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un declared that his country was facing its “worst-ever situation”.

Kim also urged ruling party officials to wage another “Arduous March” of work and sacrifice, linking the current economic crises to a period in the 1990s of famine and disaster.

The Russian ambassador, one of the few foreign envoys in the country, said while it was unclear exactly what Kim meant, the current situation could not be compared to that period.

“Thank god, it is a long shot from the Arduous March, and I hope it would never come to that,” he said. “I remember well what happened here in late 1990s and I can compare.”

He added, “The most important thing is that there is no famine in the country today.”

The United Nations meanwhile has warned of possible food shortages and other humanitarian disasters.

‘Decent local tea’

Matsegora, however, said while imported goods had effectively disappeared from store shelves, most domestic products were still available and prices had only increased moderately.

“There is no deficit felt in the main grocery products category,” he told TASS. “The prices grew, but moderately and not for all products.”

For instance, coffee, which “one hasn’t been able to buy here for awhile” has now been replaced with a “mug of very decent local tea”, he said.

It was unclear whether Matsegora’s comments applied to areas outside the relatively prosperous capital, Pyongyang.

The ambassador also said North Korea was building “large disinfection complexes” which would soon be completed, allowing some cross-border trade to resume soon.

“There is information that this work will finally be completed by the end of April, after which the flow of goods should be restored,” he said.

The move would allow North Korea to bring in international aid that has been stuck in warehouses on the Chinese side of the border. Pyongyang’s self-imposed border closures were aimed at preventing a coronavirus outbreak, but it has slowed trade that was already constrained by sanctions over North Korea’s nuclear weapons to a trickle.

Matsegora said while cross-border freight traffic could resume “in the near future”, passenger travel would only be allowed when the pandemic was resolved at a global level.

North Korea has not reported a single case of COVID-19, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), but South Korean and American officials doubt that claim.

The country is expected to receive nearly two million doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford COVID-19 vaccine by the first half of this year under the COVAX vaccine-sharing programme, but the North Korean population had been told virtually nothing about the international vaccines, Matsegora said.

The Russian ambassador is one of the few foreign ambassadors to remain in Pyongyang after some other delegations pulled out, citing the difficulty of rotating new staff.

Russia’s diplomatic mission recently complained about acute shortages of essential goods such as medicine, problems getting healthcare and pandemic restrictions that it said were unprecedented in their severity.

Still, Matsegora said Russian diplomats were much better off than other foreigners as Russia had “a large autonomous complex” in Pyongyang with “everything necessary for work and life, including a school, exercise facilities, a kindergarten, and an infirmary”.

“Nobody else has something like this in Pyongyang. So, as opposed to other diplomatic missions, we managed to almost completely retain our staff,” he said.

The ambassador added that there were signs that authorities were easing some of the domestic anti-pandemic measures, with weddings allowed and talk that classes in schools would resume this month.",705,4556,10,54
0,The Nation’s Corn Belt Has Lost a Third of Its Topsoil,https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/scientists-say-nations-corn-belt-has-lost-third-its-topsoil-180977485/,"Seth Watkins has been farming his family’s land in southern Iowa for decades, growing pasture for his cows as well as corn and other row crops. His great-grandfather founded the farm in 1848. “He came in with one of John Deere’s steel plows and pierced the prairie,” Watkins recounted. With its rolling hills and neat lines of corn stretching to the horizon, broken by clumps of trees, it’s a picturesque scene.

But centuries of farming those hills have taken their toll on the soil. Now, farmers like Watkins are facing widespread soil degradation that can lower their crop yields and incomes. “In 150 years or so, we’ve lost over half of that rich topsoil—if not all in some places.”

Crops hunger for the carbon-packed composition of rich topsoil. They need the nutrients and water that it stores, unlike the compacted, infertile soils that decades of conventional farming create.

The baseline for soil in Iowa is visible on land owned by Jon Judson, a sustainable farmer and conservation advocate. His farm hosts a rare plot of original prairie grasses and wildflowers. Under the prairie, the soil is thick and dark, with feet of organic matter built up and plenty of moisture. The next field over is a recovering conventional field like Watkins’ farm, and the effect of years of conventional practices is obvious. The soil is pale and compacted, with only a few inches of organic carbon, much less soil moisture, and a lot more clay.

Scientists and farmers know that agricultural soil erosion has been a problem for decades, but quantifying soil loss from a hundred years of farming and across multiple states has proven difficult. Now a study led by geomorphologist Evan Thaler and published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in February attempts to answer the elusive question of how much topsoil has been eroded in the Corn Belt, which stretches roughly from Ohio to Nebraska and produces 75 percent of the nation’s corn. The study estimated that about 35 percent of the region has lost its topsoil completely, leaving carbon-poor lower soil layers to do the work of supporting crops. Having thick, healthy topsoil means plants can grow faster and healthier, increasing crop yields and keeping the field’s ecosystem running smoothly. Topsoil loss creates environmental problems, such as when eroded, nutrient-laden dirt degrades streams and rivers, and is estimated to cost the Midwest’s agricultural industry almost $3 billion annually.

“I think it’s probably an underestimate,” says Thaler, a graduate student at the University of Massachusetts–Amherst. “There are areas where there’s probably a centimeter of topsoil left.”

Thaler and colleagues used soil color from satellite imagery to track which areas of Corn Belt fields were lighter or darker. Darker soils have more organic carbon, which is a good indicator that the topsoil is present. Further down in soil, less organic carbon builds up, so once those layers are exposed, the surface looks lighter. Thaler then connected a color map he created to high-resolution topographic data, which told him where slopes were steep and whether hilltops were curved in or out. When he compared soil color to hills’ shapes, the map confirmed what he and countless farmers have noticed: the tops of hills are light, and their bases are dark. Plowing and precipitation lead rich topsoil to slowly creep downhill, leaving thin, carbon-poor soil uphill. Thaler found that highly curved hilltops are more likely to have eroded topsoil. That relationship drives his general finding of highly eroded soils in the Corn Belt, but it has been missing from erosion research until now.

In 2019 using on-the-ground soil surveys, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimated that none of those same fields had complete topsoil removal. Those determinations were based on small-scale examinations of soil that were assumed to reflect larger areas. But a single sampling site may not accurately reflect topsoil across an entire field: if scientists happened to sample the bottom of a hill, they might underestimate topsoil erosion for the whole field. Another issue, Thaler says, is estimating nationwide erosion. The USDA can’t sample soil from every corner of the country, so it relies on computer models to fill in the gaps. Because the equations those models use don’t take hillslopes into account, like Thaler’s study does, soil erosion is underestimated there, too.

Rick Cruse, an agronomy professor at Iowa State University whose research on soil erosion includes remote sensing and satellite imagery, found Thaler’s results to be reasonable. “The technologies they used have been in the literature and have been developed for decades,” he says. “When I look at the landscape where they’re making these estimates, and look at the economic estimates they’ve generated, I have no pushback on what’s been done here.”

Andrea Basche, an agronomy professor at the University of Nebraska who has used aerial imagery of fields at smaller scales, says the 35 percent estimate may be a little high and that verifying modeling results on the ground by surveying soils in person is important. But she says the study is a unique use of geospatial data to address a difficult problem, and that could help raise the profile of erosion as a pressing environmental issue. “Evidence of soil degradation and erosion from more intensive agriculture is ubiquitous,” she says. “I think the study matters for elevating the conversation around this really critical issue.”

Thaler’s study shows the magnitude of soil erosion, but it is not able to say whether the erosion is due to current farmers’ practices or the long culmination of a field’s agricultural history. The Corn Belt and other agricultural regions in the United States have been heavily farmed for hundreds of years, during which both climate and agricultural methods changed. If a field has been farmed nearly continuously for such a long period of time, it’s difficult to tell whether that topsoil was lost steadily over the last 200 years or in recent spurts of erosion.

“It’s not a critique of the study, but what they did was a snapshot,” says Hannah Birgé, a soil scientist at The Nature Conservancy–Nebraska. “I know Nebraska farmers would say, ‘It probably did happen—we did major soil refining from the 1920s to ’40s. But we don’t do that anymore, so what you’re seeing is old [erosion].’”

The evolution of farming equipment and practices have affected the magnitude of erosion in the U.S. for hundreds of years. Settlers began systemically clearing the Great Plains prairie in the early 1800s as the John Deere plow became a staple of conventional tilling, which is the practice of digging up the topsoil to plant seeds. Later, gas-powered tractors made ripping up fields even easier. Aggressive plowing and monoculture planting led to unprecedented topsoil loss during the Dust Bowl. In 1935, in the wake of staggering soil and economic loss, Congress created the Soil Conservation Service (now known as the Natural Resources Conservation Service) to encourage more sustainable farming. The organization encouraged no-till planting, which conserves topsoil by not churning it up as intensely as conventional tilling, and cover crops, which help hold soil in place and replenish its nutrients, in the mid- to late-1900s. Today, such sustainable practices are beginning to spread as awareness of soil spreads too, but fewer than a quarter of fields nationally are farmed with no-till practices. Soil erosion is a slow, hard-to-spot problem, and financial pressures can keep farmers working fields even if they suspect they shouldn’t.

The slow timelines for erosion and changes in soil health are one reason it can be difficult to motivate farmers to adopt conservation practices. “It's hard not only for farmers, but also for natural resources professionals and policymakers, to address things that change over such a slow period of time,” Birgé says. “The risk is that the feedback will be slow, and then suddenly you have these nonlinear responses. Take, for example, the Dust Bowl. There were decades of slow change, then boom—30 years of mismanagement manifested in disaster.”

For farmers who own, rather than rent, their land, a long-term approach to managing their farm’s ecosystem can be guided and encouraged by federal agencies like the Natural Resources Conservation Service, which helps agricultural landowners work sustainably and efficiently. The Conservation Reserve Program, officially established by the 1985 Farm Bill, pays farmers to stop farming ecologically sensitive land for 10 to 15 years. Birgé says farmers jump at the opportunity, with more people signing up than the program can pay.

“The program has been hugely successful,” she says. “Ten years is a long time in the policy world, but it’s the blink of an eye when you think about soil erosion. It’s transformed the landscape in really important ways. But now it’s at the point where it could use more funding and some improvement.”

Cruse agrees that such economic incentive programs are essential to treating soil erosion.

“It’s really challenging to make things happen because we’re a capitalist society, and people make money by farming,” Cruse says. “There can be a resistance in the farming population to manage fields sustainably. We need a government program that would pay farmers not to farm. We need incentives and regulation.”

A dearth of economic incentives to pursue sustainable farming remains one of the main hurdles in agricultural soil conservation. While programs like the Conservation Reserve Program are successful, they are still limited in scope and funding. Other federal agriculture programs can emphasize income over environment. Crop insurance, which was created to protect farmers against sudden financial ruin if a crop fails, guarantees a set payment for a planted crop—whether or not it’s in at-risk soil that may not be able to support a successful crop.

“Most people want to take care of the land,” says Judson, of modern farmers. “But if implementing conservation changes aren’t going to show a positive benefit to them in the near future, they may be less likely to implement practices because they can’t really see value in it.”

Some farmers, though, are motivated to make a change for the better and adopt a long-term mindset. Without a direct economic incentive, Watkins decided to switch from conventional farming practices to conservation-focused ones, like planting a diverse array of native grasses, beginning in the early 1990s. In the early 2000s, he decided to add cover crops, like clover and alfalfa, which decreased soil erosion and increased his soil quality without relying on fertilizers. Even though he was already practicing no-till farming because of how steep his fields were, “My ‘no-till’ never quite worked until I added cover crops,” he says.

Farming practices that decrease erosion and increase crop yields are good for the environment in other ways. Soils store a huge amount of carbon—more than any other part of an ecosystem on land. Implementing conservation practices like cover crops can lower a farmer’s carbon footprint and reduce reliance on chemical additions to soil. “But they don’t really talk about those things in farmer meetings,” Watkins says. “The main message you get as a farmer is that it’s your job to produce and not to worry about those things.”

“The argument is that we’ve got to feed nine billion people by 2050, and that seems to give me carte blanche to do whatever I want with the land, if I’ll produce corn,” Watkins says. “I think it’s more important to build up a bank of healthy, fertile soil for when our population grows, instead of depleting it now.”

Despite the efforts of farmers like Watkins and Judson, the vast majority of the Corn Belt remains conventionally tilled. Economic incentives and risks, as well as social norms, still push many farmers to focus on yearly yield rather than long-term conservation. And as Watkins and Judson noted, simply changing one practice may not be enough to stop soil erosion. No quick, easy fixes exist to solve the problem. But focusing on the long-term and increasing funding for programs like the Conservation Reserve Program are important places to start.

After adding cover crops, Watkins continued converting his conventional farm into a sustainable practice by planting native prairie grasses and trees to improve the soil and biodiversity. He also began using geospatial data tied to financial predictions to decide which parts of a field to plant. “I started doing those things and not only did they improve my bottom line,” he says, “but I’ve also watched them improve the quality of my soil and wildlife.”

But his shadow still hangs over one of the most dramatic corruption stories ever to come out of China – a tale that has now set nerves on edge around the financial world.

At its center is China Huarong Asset Management Co., the state financial company that Lai lorded over until getting ensnared in a sweeping crackdown on corruption by China’s leader, Xi Jinping.

From Hong Kong to London to New York, questions burn. Will the Chinese government stand behind $23.2 billion that Lai borrowed on overseas markets -- or will international bond investors have to swallow losses? Are key state-owned enterprises like Huarong still too big to fail, as global finance has long assumed – or will these companies be allowed to stumble, just like anyone else?

The answers will have huge implications for China and markets across Asia. Should Huarong fail to pay back its debts in full, the development would cast doubt over a core tenet of Chinese investment: the assumed government backing for important state-owned enterprises, or SOEs.

“A default at a central state-owned company like Huarong is unprecedented,” said Owen Gallimore, head of credit strategy at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group. Should one occur, he said, it would mark “a watershed moment” for Chinese and Asian credit markets.

Not since the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s has the issue weighed so heavily. Huarong bonds -- among the most widely held SOE debt worldwide -- recently fell to a record low of about 52 cents on the dollar. That’s not the pennies on a dollar normally associated with deeply troubled companies elsewhere, but it’s practically unheard of for an SOE.

Fears of a near-term default eased on Thursday after the company was said to have prepared funds for full repayment of a S$600 million ($450 million) offshore bond due April 27. Huarong plans to pay on the due date, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named discussing private information.

Story continues

That’s a drop in the ocean and won’t remove investor concerns. All told, Huarong owes bondholders at home and abroad the equivalent of $42 billion. Some $17.1 billion of that falls due by the end of 2022, according to Bloomberg-compiled data.

Bad Bank

It wasn’t supposed to be this way. Huarong was created in the aftermath of the ‘90s Asian collapse to avert another crisis, not cause one. The idea was to contain a swelling wave of bad loans threatening Chinese banks. Huarong was to serve as a “bad bank,” a safe repository for the billions in souring loans made to state companies.

Along with three other bad banks, Huarong swapped delinquent debts for stakes in hundreds of big SOEs and, in the process, helped turn around chronic money-losers like the giant China Petroleum & Chemical Corp.

After Lai took over in 2012, Huarong reached for more, pushing into investment banking, trusts, real estate and positioning itself as a key player in China’s $54 trillion financial industry.

Before long, global banks came knocking. In 2013, for instance, Shane Zhang, co-head of Asia-Pacific investment banking at Morgan Stanley, met with Lai. Zhang said his company was “very optimistic” about the future of Huarong, according to a statement posted on Huarong’s website at the time.

Before Huarong went public in Hong Kong in 2015, it sold a $2.4 billion stake to a group of investors including Warburg Pincus, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and Malaysia’s sovereign wealth fund. BlackRock Inc. and Vanguard Group acquired lots of stock too, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock has collapsed 67% since its listing.

Lai had no trouble financing his grand ambitions. A big reason: Everyone thought Beijing would always stand behind a key company like Huarong. It easily borrowed money in the offshore market at rates as low as 2.1%. It borrowed still more in the domestic interbank market. Along the way Lai transformed Huarong into a powerful shadow lender, extending credit to companies that banks turned away.

The truth was darker. Lai, a former senior official at the nation’s banking regulator, doled out loans with little oversight from his board or risk management committee.

One Huarong credit officer said Lai personally called the shots on most of the offshore corporate loans underwritten by her division.

Money also flowed to projects disguised as parts of China’s push to build railroads, ports and more around the world – the so-called Belt and Road Initiative, according to an executive at a state bank. Huarong didn’t immediately reply to questions on its lending practices.

Given Lai’s fate, both people spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Huarong snapped up more than half of the 510 billion yuan in distressed debts disposed of by Chinese banks in 2016. At its peak, Lai’s sprawling empire had almost 200 units at home and abroad. He boasted in 2017 that Huarong, having reached the Hong Kong stock exchange, would soon go public in mainland China, too.

The IPO never happened. Lai was arrested in 2018 and subsequently confessed to a range of economic crimes in a state TV show. He spoke of trunk-loads of cash being spirited into a Beijing apartment he’d dubbed “the supermarket.” Authorities said they discovered 200 million yuan there. Expensive real estate, luxury watches, art, gold – the list of Lai’s treasure ran on.

This past January, Lai was found guilty by the Secondary Intermediate People’s Court in Tianjin of accepting of $277 million in bribes between 2008 and 2018. He was put to death three weeks later – a rare use of capital punishment for economic crimes. Some took the execution as a message from China’s leader, Xi Jinping: my crackdown on corruption will roll on.

At Huarong, the bottom has fallen out. Net income plummeted 95% from 2017 to 2019, to 1.4 billion yuan, and then sank 92% during the first half of 2020. Assets have shriveled by 165 billion yuan.

The company on April 1 announced that it would delay its 2020 results, saying its auditor needed more time. The influential Caixin magazine this week openly speculated about Huarong’s fate, including the possibility of bankruptcy. Its credit outlook was put on review for a potential downgrade by all three top rating firms.

According to people familiar with the matter, Huarong has proposed a sweeping restructuring. The plan would involve offloading its money-losing, non-core businesses. Huarong is still trying to get a handle on what those businesses might be worth. The proposal, which the government would have to approve, helps explain why the company delayed its 2020 results, the people said.

Company executives have been meeting with peers at state banks to assuage their concerns over the past two weeks, a Huarong official said.

The Chinese finance ministry has raised another possibility: transferring its stake in Huarong to a unit of the nation’s sovereign wealth fund that could then sort out the assorted debt problems. Regulators have held several meetings to discuss the company’s plight, according to people familiar with the matter.

In an emailed response to questions from Bloomberg, Huarong said it has “adequate liquidity” and plans to announce the expected date of its 2020 earnings release after consulting with auditors. China’s banking and insurance regulator didn’t immediately respond to a request seeking comment on Huarong’s situation.

News the company aims to repay a note due this month helped its bonds rebound from record lows on Thursday. It’s not just about cost of funding though, said Thu Ha Chow, a portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles Investments Asia in Singapore. For Huarong to access the market it will need “a clear and definitive commitment,” from China’s finance ministry toward the offshore debt or clarity on a restructuring, she said.

One thing is sure: Huarong is part of a much bigger problem in China. State-owned enterprises are shouldering the equivalent of $4.1 trillion in debt, and a growing number of them are struggling to keep current with creditors. In all, SOEs reneged on a record 79.5 billion yuan of local bonds in 2020, lifting their share of onshore payment failures to 57% from just 8.5% a year earlier, according to Fitch Ratings. The figure jumped to 72% in the first quarter of 2021.

The shockwaves from Huarong and these broader debt problems have only begun to reverberate through Chinese finance. Dismantling all or part of Lai’s old empire would show Beijing is willing to accept short-term pain to instill financial discipline among state-owned enterprises.

The irony is that Huarong was supposed to fix China’s big debt problem, not cause a new one.

“Allowing a state-owned financial institution that undertook the task of resolving troubles of China’s financial system to fail is the worst way to handle risks,” said Feng Jianlin, a Beijing-based chief analyst at research institute FOST. “The authorities must consider the massive risk spillover effects.”

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Chris Lambert would like to get back to making music but he can’t seem to stop chasing a ghost that has haunted him for nearly 25 years.

A billboard on the side of the road on California’s Central Coast led him on a detour three years ago from his career as a singer-songwriter and recording engineer. He created a podcast about the 1996 disappearance of college freshman Kristin Smart and it’s taken over his life.

“I can’t step away from it for more than a few days,” Lambert said. “I just get sucked right back in because I want to be resolving things.”

It was an unlikely turn for someone who refers to himself as a shy, “random boy with a beard” and it has produced results he never imagined.

On Tuesday, as San Luis Obispo County Sheriff Ian Parkinson announced arrests , he credited Lambert with helping draw worldwide attention to the case and bringing forward several key witnesses.

The longtime suspect, Paul Flores, and Smart were fellow freshmen at the California Polytechnic State University campus in San Luis Obispo. Now 44, Flores was charged with murder in the killing of the 19-year-old while trying to rape her in his dorm room, prosecutors said.

His father, Ruben Flores, 80, was charged as an accessory after authorities said he helped hide the body, which has never been located.

Paul Flores’ lawyer has declined to comment on the criminal charge. A lawyer for Ruben Flores said his client is innocent.

Lambert has been thrust into the spotlight with the arrests. His eight-part series, “ Your Own Backyard, ” hit 7.5 million downloads Thursday and it was the No. 2 podcast on iTunes. Lambert’s phone has been blowing up with messages — from fans, tipsters and news reporters. He appreciates the attention but has been overwhelmed.

“It’s driving me insane,” he said, yet he remained focused, patient and polite during a 45-minute interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday.

All the attention isn’t leading to any money — Lambert takes no advertising for the podcast, relying on donations.

His is the latest in a line of true-crime podcasts to play a role in an arrest, a court appeal or even an exoneration.

“Up and Vanished” led a man to confess to killing a Georgia beauty queen, while “Serial” helped a convicted murderer win a new trial in Maryland. “In the Dark” unearthed new evidence in a case prosecutors dropped instead of seeking a seventh trial against a Mississippi man who spent decades on death row.

Lambert, 33, was just 8 when Smart vanished a short drive up the coast from his own home in the small town of Orcutt, about 140 miles (225 kilometers) northwest of Los Angeles. It scared him that someone had gone missing and no one knew what happened.

For more than two decades, a billboard featuring a photo of a grinning Smart advertised a $75,000 reward. It’s located in the town of Arroyo Grande. where Paul Flores grew up and his parents still live.

Lambert passed it many times and it ultimately motivated him to start investigating.

“I thought I’d give it a shot and see if I could get a few people talking,” Lambert said. “All I have to do is get over my shyness and start calling these people out of the blue and start asking really personal questions.”

He bought some high-quality recording equipment and began making calls. He located overlooked or reluctant witnesses who hadn’t spoken with police, he said.

People opened up to Lambert and he encouraged them to contact investigators with relevant information. Deputies started calling him to connect them with people he interviewed.

“What Chris did with the podcast was put it out nationally to bring in new information,” Parkinson said without elaborating on the new evidence. “It did produce some information that I believe was valuable.”

A former colleague of Paul Flores’ mother, Susan Flores, told him Mrs. Flores came into work after Memorial Day weekend 1996 — when Smart went missing — saying she didn’t sleep well because her husband had gotten a phone call in the middle of the night and left in his car.

“The speculation has been all along that Paul called his dad in the middle of the night and his dad came up and helped him get rid of Kristin’s body,” Lambert said.

A tenant who lived for a year at Susan Flores’ home told him she heard a watch alarm every morning at 4:20 a.m. Smart had worked as a lifeguard at 5 a.m. at the Cal Poly pool, so it’s possible she set her watch to wake up at that early hour.

“That seems to be the moment in the podcast series that most people have been just completely shaken,” he said. “This may be the piece of evidence that points to the fact that Kristin was buried in that backyard or that her belongings were buried in that backyard.”

Susan Flores, who hung up when called by the AP, told KSBY-TV in March in the only interview she’s granted that she could “shoot a lot of holes into a lot of (Lambert’s) lies.”

She said Lambert never contacted her. He said he sent an intermediary to her house and Susan Flores threatened to call the police. His efforts to speak with Paul Flores were also fruitless, he said.

Lambert spoke with a former Australian exchange student at Cal Poly who said he saw Flores and Smart struggling near where Smart was last seen. Lambert said investigators had dismissed that account in the early years of the probe.

Lambert has developed a close relationship with the Smart family, who issued a statement after the arrest, praising his skills and “unselfish dedication.”

He is grateful to have grown close to the family. He feels like he’s gotten to know Kristin Smart, but wishes he had the chance to meet her.

“For most of my life, Kristin Smart has been a face on a billboard,” he wrote on Instagram. “I’ve learned about Kristin the daughter, Kristin the big sister, Kristin the friend, the neighbor, the roommate. Kristin the swimmer. Kristin the dreamer. And I’ve learned that you can miss a person you never even got to meet.”",1223,7096,8,54
0,Italy gives timetable for easing COVID-19 restrictions,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/italy-gives-timetable-easing-covid-19-restrictions-2021-04-16/,"Italy will ease coronavirus curbs in many areas from April 26, the government said on Friday, warning caution was still needed to avoid any reversals in the reopening of many long-shuttered activities.

Restrictions on business and movement have been in place for most of this year in Italy, which has the seventh highest death toll in the world and still reports hundreds of fatalities every day.

Current restrictions were set to expire at the start of May, and no decision had been taken on how to replace them.

Prime Minister Mario Draghi set out a broad timetable for reopening after pressure from parties in his national unity administration, particularly the rightist League.

""The government is taking a reasonable risk based on data that is improving, although not dramatically,"" Draghi told a news conference.

Last month, with cases and hospitalisations rising, Italy paused the four-tier, colour-coded system it uses to calibrate the restrictions in place in its 20 regions and enforced the tougher red or orange zones nationwide.

From April 26, the more lenient yellow and white zones will be reinstated where infection levels are low. In these areas restaurants and bars will be able to serve clients at outside tables and cinemas and theatres will reopen with attendance limits.

""Our idea is to allow open-air swimming pools from May 15 and restart some gym activities on June 1,"" Health Minister Roberto Speranza told reporters.

Currently, three regions are red and 17 are orange, with severe restrictions on business and movement. With the number of new cases gradually declining, many of these hope to become yellow when the colour zone is reinstated.

Draghi said it would be crucial that people strictly respected social distancing rules and wore face masks to move forward with the reopenings.

""This is based on a premise, that people and institutions observe the rules so that this reasonable risk is successful,"" he said.

0,France cuts two submarines in half to make one new one,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/14/europe/france-submarines-cut-in-half-intl-hnk-scli-ml/index.html,"(CNN) A French nuclear-powered submarine severely damaged by fire last year has been saved from the scrapyard -- by cutting it in two and welding the salvageable half to part of another decommissioned sub.

An intense 14-hour-long accidental fire on the attack submarine Perle while it was in dry dock for repairs last June left the front section of the boat unusable, according to the French Defense Ministry. It suffered structural damage to steel components that could not be repaired.

But the rear half of the 241-foot-long (73 meters) submarine, which has a displacement of 2,600 tons, was not damaged during the fire at a shipyard in Toulon, southern France.

The French submarine Perle is seen in Portsmouth, UK, in 2004.

Luckily for the French navy, one of the Perle's sister boats, the Saphir, which was retired from service in 2019, was awaiting dismantling at a shipyard in the northwestern port of Cherbourg.

The Saphir's front section was structurally sound, and French officials determined it could be mated with the rear of the Perle to make one serviceable attack submarine.

The damaged Perle was moved from Toulon to Cherbourg on a semi-submersibile ship in December.

Workers cut the Perle in half in February and did the same to the Saphir in March, according to a news release from French shipbuilder Naval Group.

Firefighters spray water on the submarine Perle (right) after a fire broke out on board while it underwent repairs in Toulon, France on June 12, 2020.

At the beginning of this month, the back half of the Perle and the front half of the Saphir were put on ""walkers"" at the Cherbourg shipyard so they could be carefully aligned and then welded together, the Naval Group release said.

Naval Group spokesperson Klara Nadaradjane said the joining work would be completed in the coming months.

The resulting submarine, which will still be called the Perle, will be about four-and-a-half feet (1.4 meters) longer than either of its predecessors to accommodate a ""junction area"" while the miles of cables and pipes that run through the sub will be spliced together, the release said.

The junction area will also provide room for new living quarters, adding a bit of space for the crew of 70 submariners.

Digital modeling

All that work will be rehearsed using a three-dimensional digital model before being attempted aboard the submarine, Naval Group said.

The task involves 100,000 hours of engineering studies and 250,000 hours of industrial work by 300 people, it said.

Nadaradjane said industry regulations did not allow the company to give a cost for the operation.

The Perle, commissioned in 1993, was the newest of what once were six Rubis-class nuclear submarines in the French fleet. The Saphir, the second boat in the class, was commissioned in 1984, serving 35 years before its decommissioning.

The French submarine Saphir is seen in this August 15, 2004, file photo.

The Rubis-class subs are scheduled to be replaced in coming years by the new Barracuda nuclear-powered submarines, the first of which, the Suffren, was delivered to the French navy in November. But the sixth Barracuda sub isn't expected to join the fleet until 2030, so the half-and-half Perle will be needed to keep French attack sub numbers at the required six, according to Naval Group.

Franck Ferrer, programs director for the Services Division of Naval Group, said in January that the new Perle was expected to be moved back to Toulon late this year for more technical work and upgrades to its combat systems before entering the French fleet in early 2023.

""Carrying out this type of project in these circumstances, i.e. repair work that involves joining the fore and aft ends of two sister ships, is of course a first in the modern history of Naval Group,"" Ferrer said.

Modern submarine construction

But it's not the first of its kind.

""The United States Navy did something similar to that when it replaced the bow of the damaged USS San Francisco, which ran aground on a seamount near Guam in 2005, with the bow of USS Honolulu, which was slated to be retired,"" said Thomas Shugart, a retired US Navy attack submarine commander.

And these kind of repairs beat starting from scratch, he said.

""For sure it would be a lot of work, but probably a lot less than building a whole new submarine,"" said Shugart, now a fellow at the Center for a New American Security.

Shugart said current submarine construction essentially does what the French are doing now in the Cherbourg shipyard.

""All new-construction US submarines are now built using modular construction, which is essentially putting pieces of submarine together, though clearly in a more planned-for fashion than in the case of this repaired French submarine,"" he said.

The rebirth of the Perle is certainly a better outcome than that experienced by another fire-damaged submarine, the USS Miami

0,Germany to offer refuge to Afghans who helped military,https://www.dw.com/en/germany-to-offer-refuge-to-afghans-who-helped-military/a-57242960,"German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer wants the country to take in Afghan nationals who helped the German military during the war in Afghanistan, she told the German news agency DPA in remarks published Sunday.

Her comments come as NATO and the United States announced the withdrawal of their troops from Afghanistan this year, prompting fears that some Afghans could now be in danger after helping foreign forces.

German troops are deployed to the country as part of NATO's Resolute Support mission to train the Afghan National Defence forces.

How could Germany help?

A procedure for admitting local Afghan staff who need refuge already exists, although there are a number of disputed cases.

According to the Defense Ministry, 781 people have been approved for residency since 2013.

Kramp-Karrenbauer wants the existing process to be streamlined and accelerated, the news agency said.

The Welt am Sonntag newspaper, citing the Interior Ministry, reported that Germany plans to set up an office in Kabul and probably also one in Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan to help process cases.

'A deep obligation'

""We are talking about people here who have worked alongside us, even at the risk of their own safety, for years in some cases, and have also fought alongside us and made their personal contribution,"" Kramp-Karrenbauer was quoted as saying by DPA.

""I feel it is a deep obligation of the Federal Republic of Germany not to leave these people behind without protection now that we are finally leaving the country.""

Kramp-Karrenbauer added that helping local personnel was also an obligation of all international forces in Afghanistan to ensure the safety of the Afghan staff.

Taliban poses a threat

Since Washington and NATO announced the troop withdrawal decision, rights groups have raised concerns over Afghanistan's destiny.

They fear that the Islamist Taliban would seize more power in the country. While Western powers are aware of the potential chaos that looms over post-withdrawal Afghanistan, they have pledged to support the people.

The Taliban has already been vocal with threats over the withdrawal announcement.

They want foreign troops to pull out by May 1 as per agreement with former US President Donald Trump.

Thomas Silberhorn, a member of the Bundestag and Parliamentary State Secretary at Germany's Ministry of Defense, recently told DW that NATO has done a ""brilliant job"" on preparing Afghan forces to secure the country by themselves.

Germany is set to pull out its NATO's Resolute Support mission by mid-August and the US by September 11.

There are currently around 10,000 NATO troops in Afghanistan, including nearly 1,100 Germans.

OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — A Canadian Parliament member was caught stark naked in a virtual meeting of the House of Commons.

William Amos, who has represented the Quebec district of Pontiac since 2015, appeared on the screens of his fellow lawmakers completely naked Wednesday. The pandemic has meant many Canadian lawmakers participate in sessions via video conference instead of in person.

A screenshot obtained by The Canadian Press shows Amos standing behind a desk between the Quebec and Canadian flags, his private parts hidden by what appears to be a mobile phone in one hand.

“This was an unfortunate error,″ Amos said in a statement sent by email. ”`My video was accidentally turned on as I was changing into my work clothes after going for a jog. I sincerely apologize to my colleagues in the House of Commons for this unintentional distraction. Obviously, it was an honest mistake and it won’t happen again.”

Claude DeBellefeuille, a legislator for the opposition Bloc Quebecois party, raised the incident in a point of order after question period, suggesting that parliamentary decorum requires male Parliament members to wear a jacket and tie — and a shirt, underwear and trousers.

Speaker Anthony Rota later thanked DeBellefeuille for her “observations” and clarified that while he had not seen anything, he checked with technicians and confirmed they saw something. He reminded lawmakers to always be vigilant when they are near a camera and microphone.

Amos, the parliamentary secretary to Industry Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne, was visible only to Parliament members and staffers on an internal video conference feed. Because he was not speaking, his image did not show up on the public feed.

Liberal Party colleague Mark Holland said Amos was “utterly mortified.” Holland said he was satisfied with the explanation from his colleague.

“I don’t think there was any ill intent. It’s certainly an unfortunate circumstance,″ Holland said.

“This is a warning to everybody,” Holland added. “You’ve got to really always assume that camera is on and be very careful any time you wander anywhere near that camera that you’re dressed appropriately.″

0,Sketch mocking Chinese launches racism debate in Italy,https://abcnews.go.com/amp/Entertainment/wireStory/sketch-mocking-chinese-launches-racism-debate-italy-77097638,"MILAN -- A sketch on a popular Italian TV show mocking Chinese people has launched a debate about racism, and satire, in Italy.

While Asian and Black activists took to social media to share their experiences with racism growing up in Italy, including how it can be fomented by satire, the TV hosts at the center of the uproar said Thursday they have been subjected to a “wave of hatred,” including death threats.

Michelle Hunziker and Gerry Scotti, hosts of the satirical show “Striscia la Notizia” (“The News Crawls”) on the private Mediaset network, apologized for the sketch during which they made slanted-eye gestures and mimicked a Chinese accent as they introduced a segment.

“We are pained, deeply,” Hunziker told Corriere della Sera in an interview published a day after she apologized on Instagram. “We were in good faith: we are very sorry knowing that we bumped against the sensitivity of someone. But what is happening is frightening: we received a real wave of hatred that is being spread in an instrumentalized way.”

Hunziker spoke of an organized campaign against the co-hosts, that also targeted the Trussardi fashion house founded by the family of her husband, Tomaso Trussardi. “We are talking about almond-shaped eyes made by Gerry and me, when in China there are unspeakable things happening, on which we should concentrate if we want to speak of human rights.”

The producers of the show, however, refused to apologize, saying that “Striscia la Notizia” is satire, “and like satirical and comic programs all over the world, politically incorrect.”

And they struck back, citing “spurious and fascist initiatives of those who think they are blackmailing international companies and brands.”

It was the second time that the pair were skewered recently on social media, after they replayed an older sketch that used racist language to describe African children. And it comes a week after Black Lives Matter protests outside the Rome studios of RAI state television over on-air racist language and the use of blackface on one show.

The co-hosts had their defenders, who on radio shows decried what they saw as the importation of ‘cancel culture’ from the United States and the death knell of satire.

A representative of the Chinese community in Milan, Francesco Wu, said satire should be aimed at the powerful, not against minorities, especially those easily singled out.

""In this historic context, when there are many episodes of violence against the Asian community around the world, we need to be careful and not convey a message that can generate racism and discrimination,'' Wu told The Associated Press.

Wu said he made the same points in an interview with “Striscia la Notizia” in a bid to calm tensions. He emphasized that the threats against the co-hosts did not come from the Chinese community.

Black Italian activist Maddalena Fadika said shows like “Striscia la Notizia” normalize racism. “Everything is taken as satire, as a joke, stereotypes projected on minorities are taken as normal,’’ she said.

Black Lives Matter protests have grown in Italy in the last year, campaigning for looser citizenship laws for the children of foreign residents and underlining that Italy is already a multicultural society, with more than 1.2 million African-origin residents.

Chinese comprise the third-largest non-EU population in Italy, numbering some 320,000, with a strong business presence in textile-making in Tuscany and in Italy's financial capital Milan. Panic over the coronavirus in the last year has made them increasingly the target of discrimination.

An influencer who goes by the name of Momoka Banana said in a video post that she endured teasing for her Chinese appearance growing up in Rome.

“It didn’t make me feel comfortable,’’ she said. “In fact, it made me ashamed of my origins, so much that I refused for many years to learn Chinese.’’

Even now, Momoka Banana, who frequently shares stories of her life on Instagram and YouTube, said she endures people yelling on the street to make fun of the typical Chinese accent.

“People say, what do you care about the jokes, you are stronger,’’ she said. “Yes, OK, at the threshold of 30 years, I can say they are idiots, those who make fun of me. But I would not like that my nieces and nephews are made fun of at school, perhaps by classmates who saw ‘Striscia la Notizia,’ and found the joke funny.”",726,4397,8,54

Ashkenazi met in person with Cypriot Foreign Minister Nikos Christodoulides, Greek Foreign Minister Nicos Dendias and the Emirati minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash — with Emirati Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed joining them virtually.

The ministers held bilateral meetings before holding a four-way meeting; there are plans for the officials from the four countries to convene regularly, both at the ministerial and professional working levels.

At a joint press conference, Ashkenazi emphasized that Israel will do whatever is needed to ensure that Iran does not acquire nuclear weapons. “We also took time to discuss challenges that Iran and Hezbollah and other extremists pose to the stability of the Middle East and to the regional peace.” He said Israel will do whatever it takes to block malevolent actions and “prevent this regime from having nuclear weapons.”

After the meeting, Ashkenazi tweeted, “It is my pleasure to meet with my friends, the Foreign Ministers, and to discuss issues of great importance to the entire region with them, particularly Iran’s aggressive policy and the destabilization of the Middle East that results from it.”

Ashkenazi added, “Israel is determined to defend itself against any attempt to harm its sovereignty or citizens, and will do whatever it takes to prevent this radical regime from acquiring nuclear weapons and arming its proxies.”

The meeting was held against the backdrop of growing tensions between Israel and Iran, especially on the maritime front, and while discussions are undergoing in Vienna on a possible renewed nuclear agreement between Tehran and Washington. Still, the Iranian threat was just one of a series of issues discussed by the foreign affairs leaders of the four countries. Israel, Greece and Cyprus have been working closely together for several months now in the field of energy, with the Emiratis recently joining this alliance of regional energy cooperation. The leaders also discussed tourism against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic and other key economic issues. Similarly, the subjects of Turkey and Libya were also on the table.

Gargash said the UAE seeks an “ambitious and positive agenda in the region and the Abraham Accords were driven by the necessity of an alternative strategic view the region based on stability, prosperity and opportunity.”

But the greatest importance of the meeting may have been the framework created there, and the evident feeling of trust registered by its participants.

Still, it remains to be seen how Israel’s next foreign minister will take up this newly forged friendship. Ashkenazi did not run in the March 23 elections and is bound to step down from his post in the coming weeks.",459,2887,7,55

MOSCOW (AP) — An American astronaut and two Russians have returned to Earth after six months aboard the International Space Station.

A Soyuz space capsule carrying NASA’s Kate Rubins and Russians Sergey Ryzhikov and Sergey Kud-Sverchkov landed at 0455 GMT (12:55 a.m. EDT) Saturday in the steppes of Kazakhstan.

Dmitry Rogozin, head of the Russian space agency Roskosmos, said all three were feeling well after they were extracted from the capsule and began reacclimating to the pull of gravity.

The three had arrived at the orbiting laboratory complex on Oct. 14.

There now are seven people aboard the ISS: NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei and Russians Oleg Novitskiy and Pyotr Dubrov arrived on April 9; Americans Michael Hopkins, Victor Glover and Shannon Walker, and Japan’s Soichi Noguchi, came aboard in November on the SpaceX Crew Dragon Resilience, the first ISS docking under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program.",282,1821,9,55

CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Alex White thought he was watching a huge worm writhing in plastic-wrapped lettuce he’d just brought home from a Sydney supermarket — until a snake tongue flicked.

“I kind of completely freaked out when I saw this little tongue come out of its mouth and start flicking around and realized it was a snake because worms don’t have tongues,” White said on Thursday.

“I definitely kind of panicked a bit,” he added.

It was a venomous pale-headed snake that authorities say made an 870-kilometer (540-mile) journey to Sydney from a packing plant in the Australian city of Toowoomba wrapped in plastic with two heads of cos lettuce.

The refrigerated supermarket supply chain likely lulled the cold-blooded juvenile into a stupor until White bought the lettuce at an ALDI supermarket on Monday evening and rode his bicycle home with salad and snake in his backpack.

White and his partner Amelia Neate spotted the snake moving as soon as the lettuce was unpacked onto the kitchen table.

They also noticed the plastic wrapping was torn and that the snake could escape, so they quickly stuffed the reptile with the lettuce into a plastic food storage container.

White phoned the WIRES rescue organization and a snake handler took the snake away that night.

Before the handler arrived, White said WIRES had explained to him: “If you get bitten, you’ve got to go to hospital really quickly.”

ALDI is investigating how a snake could have found its way into a supermarket.

“We’ve worked with the customer and the team at WIRES to identify the snake’s natural habitat, which is certainly not an ALDI store!” the German-based supermarket chain said in a statement.

WIRES reptile coordinator Gary Pattinson said while the snake was less than 20 centimeters (8 inches) long, it was “as venomous as it will ever be.”

Pattinson is caring for the snake until it is returned to Queensland state next week, following the WIRES policy of returning rescued wildlife to where it comes from.

“It’s the first snake I’ve ever had in sealed, packed produce,” Pattinson said. “We get frogs in them all the time.”

Neate, a German immigrant, said her brush with a venomous snake in a Sydney kitchen was a setback in her efforts to assure relatives in Europe that Australia’s notoriously deadly Outback wildlife was nothing to worry about.

“For the last 10 years or so, I’ve told my family at home that Australia’s a really safe country,” Neate said.

“I’ve always said I’m just in the city; it’s totally fine here,” she added.",540,3180,9,55
0,8-year-old kidnapped French lady rescued in Switzerland,https://times24x7.com/2021/04/19/8-year-old-kidnapped-french-lady-rescued-in-switzerland-3155.html,"An eight-year-old girl was rescued in Switzerland on Sunday, five days after being kidnapped from her grandmother’s French home in a “military” style operation with the alleged involvement of her mother.

After a massive search, investigators found the girl, Mia, and her mother Lola Montemaggi in a squat inside an abandoned factory in the Swiss municipality of Sainte-Croix, French prosecutors said.

The 28-year-old mother was arrested along with five others accused of helping her.

Three of the men posed as child welfare officials — even using forged identifications — to convince Mia’s maternal grandmother to hand her over at their home in the village of Poulieres near France’s border with Switzerland on Tuesday.

No violence was used in the abduction, but the public prosecutor of Nancy, Francois Perain, said it was like a “military operation,” with the “extremely well-prepared” kidnappers even giving it a code name: “Operation Lima.”

They had walkie-talkies, camping gear, fake licence plates, and a budget of 3,000 euros to cover expenses, the prosecutor said.

The kidnappers were not known to police but were described as part of the same “community of ideas”.

“They are against the state and mobilised against what they call a health dictatorship,” the prosecutor said, adding that for them “children in care are unfairly taken from their parents”.

After the kidnapping, three of the men and her mother walked over the French-Swiss border, taking turns with the child.

Then a man nicknamed Romeo picked up Mia and her mother in a Porsche and drove them to a Swiss hotel.

They then spent a night with a woman who was a “sympathiser of the movement” before arriving in Sainte-Croix.

Five people linked to the kidnapping, aged 23 to 60, were arrested in France from Wednesday to Friday.

Mia is safe and in good health, and a psychologist and social worker would take care of her before she is handed back to her grandmother, the prosecutor said.

But with the story becoming big news in France, intense media pressure meant they would not immediately be reunited in Poulieres, investigators said.

The mother Lola Montemaggi did not resist arrest when Swiss investigators arrived at the abandoned factory in two vans, though Mia screamed, witnesses told an AFP photographer.

Montemaggi was taken into Swiss police custody and was expected to soon be the subject of a European arrest warrant for her extradition to France.

Nearly 200 police officers were mobilised in the search effort.

For her paternal grandparents, her rescue “is a huge relief”, they said through their lawyer.

“It is the end of nights of anguish and fear for the life of our little girl, in particular because of the extremist commitments of the kidnappers,” they added.",452,2767,7,55
0,Iran says suspect behind Natanz plant attack identified,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/17/iran-says-suspect-behind-natanz-plant-attack-identified,"Iranian authorities name 43-year-old Reza Karimi as the perpetrator behind the nuclear plant attack, say he has fled the country.

Iran has said it identified a suspect in connection with a recent explosion and power outage at its main Natanz nuclear plant, as talks got under way in Austria’s capital to try to save the country’s nuclear deal with world powers.

State television said the 43-year-old man named Reza Karimi had fled Iran before last Sunday’s blast that it has blamed on archrival Israel.

It showed what it said was a photograph of the suspected perpetrator on a red card that had “Interpol Wanted” written on it.

“Necessary steps are underway for his arrest and return to the country through legal channels,” the report added.

Israel has not officially accepted responsibility for the attack but has imposed no censorship restrictions on its wide coverage by local media, some of which has explicitly said Israel’s spy agency Mossad was responsible.

The attack at Iran’s main nuclear facilities led to a large blackout and damaged an unknown number of centrifuges.

State television on Saturday also aired footage of rows of what it said were centrifuges that had replaced the ones damaged in the blast at the Natanz uranium enrichment plant.

The report added that “a large number” of centrifuges whose enrichment activity was disrupted by the explosion had been returned to normal service.

Meanwhile, officials from the remaining parties to the 2015 nuclear deal – Iran, China, Russia, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, together with the European Union – concluded a formal meeting in Vienna on a hopeful note, with different parties saying progress was being made.

Representatives from the United States, which unilaterally left the accord in 2018 and imposed sanctions on Iran, were again in a different hotel with Europeans shuttling back and forth between them and other representatives.

The agreement prevented Iran from stockpiling enough high-enriched uranium to be able to pursue a nuclear weapon if it chose in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.

After the talks, Iran’s top negotiator said a “new understanding” appears to be forming between all sides as the results of the job done by two working groups – one to determine what sanctions the US needs to lift, and one to determine what nuclear measures Iran needs to take – were reviewed.

“There is now a shared view of the end goal between all sides and the path that needs to be taken is a bit better known,” said Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s deputy foreign minister and a veteran negotiator.

“Although it won’t be an easy path. There are some serious differences that will need to be resolved,” he added.

Iran’s nuclear chief Ali Akbar Salehi said the country began production of 60 percent enriched uranium on Friday. Iran has said it wants to use it to produce molybdenum to ultimately manufacture radiopharmaceuticals.

Iran had previously boosted its uranium enrichment to 20 percent following the assassination of a top nuclear and military scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, in November. The nuclear deal caps the country’s enrichment at 3.67 percent. Enrichment of 90 percent is required for weapons-grade use.

Iran insists its nuclear programme is peaceful, though Western countries and the UN’s nuclear watchdog say Tehran had an organised military nuclear programme up until the end of 2003. An annual US intelligence report released on Tuesday maintained the longtime US assessment that Iran is not currently trying to build a nuclear bomb.",577,3555,8,55

Tehran, Iran – Another round of talks in Vienna to restore Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers has concluded on a hopeful note as different sides said progress is being made.

The Joint Commission of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) convened on Saturday in the Austrian capital with top negotiators from Iran, China, Russia, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom.

Representatives from the United States, which left the accord in 2018 and unilaterally imposed sanctions on Iran, were again in a different hotel with Europeans shuttling back and forth between them and other representatives.

After the talks, Iran’s top negotiator said a “new understanding” appears to be forming between all sides as the results of the job done by two working groups – one to determine what sanctions the US needs to lift, and one to determine what nuclear measures Iran needs to take – were reviewed.

“Although it won’t be an easy path. There are some serious differences that will need to be resolved,” he added.

Araghchi said the talks have now reached a stage where all sides can work on a joint text. He said Iran has drafted a text, both on sanction-lifting and on nuclear measures, that will act as the basis for a final agreement.

Enrique Mora, the European Union’s deputy foreign policy chief, said in a tweet following the Joint Commission meeting that “progress has been made” in what is a difficult task and more work is needed, but “everyone is committed to the same objective” of the US rejoining the deal.

Russian representative Mikhail Ulyanov also tweeted that progress has been made, and that participants had “expressed determination to continue negotiations with a view to complete the process successfully as soon as possible”.

According to Ulyanov, the expert working groups will continue their work through next week, after which the Joint Commission may reconvene if necessary.

The latest round of talks, which began on Thursday, continued even as Araghchi announced on Wednesday that Iran will soon commence enriching uranium to a purity of 60 percent.

The announcement came days after Iran’s main nuclear facilities at Natanz were targeted in an attack – which Tehran alleges was orchestrated by Israel – that led to a large blackout and damaged an unknown number of centrifuges.

Iran had previously boosted its uranium enrichment to 20 percent following the assassination of a top nuclear and military scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, in November. The JCPOA caps the country’s enrichment at 3.67 percent. Enrichment of 90 percent is required for weapons-grade use.

Iran’s state television on Saturday aired footage from inside the Natanz complex, where centrifuges were shown to be enriching uranium.

Iran’s nuclear chief Ali Akbar Salehi said the country began production of 60 percent enriched uranium on Friday. Iran has said it wants to use it to produce molybdenum to ultimately manufacture radiopharmaceuticals.

0,How China attempts to control the narrative on Xinjiang,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/16/china/beijing-xinjiang-uyghurs-propaganda-intl-hnk-dst/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN) China's Foreign Ministry this month issued the most forceful defense of its policies in Xinjiang to date, calling allegations of ""genocide"" in the region the ""lie of the century.""

The statement -- made in response to ongoing calls for a possible boycott of the 2022 Beijing Olympics -- represents the culmination of a long evolution of China's official narrative regarding its treatment of Uyghurs.

This evolving strategy, from outright denial to hardened public defense, is closely tied to the Chinese government's own increased sense of confidence on the world stage, and its willingness to confront its critics in the West head on, be it over Xinjiang, the South China Sea or Hong Kong, a CNN analysis shows.

In recent months, Xinjiang has become something of a patriotic litmus test, in which those wishing to do business with China must pick a side -- either stand with Beijing in implicit defense of its policies, or face the consequences.

The propaganda campaign has also reached a fever pitch, with state media reporters dispatched to Xinjiang to supposedly ""prove"" there is no oppression there, a ""La La Land""-inspired musical released to make Beijing's case, while critics overseas have faced sanctions and harassment.

While China has always maintained a sophisticated propaganda apparatus at home, its recent campaign over Xinjiang, particularly disinformation and harassment of critics overseas, is more in keeping with similar efforts by Russia, including deploying ""whataboutism"" in claiming any US denouncements are tainted by the legacy of slavery and genocide on the American continent.

Warning signs

After she was ""de-radicalized,"" Amina Hojamet swapped her burqa for a silk dress, put a traditional flower-patterned hat on her head, and sang ""Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China.""

She didn't know it at the time, but Hojamet, along with over a dozen other women from her village in Shufu County, in western Xinjiang -- whose story was recounted in a report by the state-run Xinjiang Daily -- would serve as proof of concept for an ""anti-extremism"" campaign that has engulfed the Chinese region since 2017.

According to reliable scholarly estimates, up to 2 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities have passed through a system of detention camps set up throughout Xinjiang in recent years . In the camps, they have been subjected to intense ""re-education,"" designed to strip them of their Islamic faith and ethnic identity in the name of fighting religious terrorism and separatism.

Survivors of the camps report experiencing or witnessing widespread abuse, and incidents of torture, rape and forced sterilization. The crackdown has been denounced as ""genocide"" by the United States government and the Canadian and Dutch parliaments for its effects on the Uyghur people and their culture.

When reports of the camp system first began to emerge around 2017, China issued staunch denials, or refused to comment altogether. As this has become increasingly impossible in the face of mounting international attention and subsequent condemnation, Beijing has shifted to an angry defense of its ""de-radicalization"" program, which it has even started to tout to like-minded countries as a way of dealing with their own Muslim ""problem.""

Meanwhile, evidence of the camp system, such as early reports in state media like one which gave Hojamet's story in late 2014, have been scrubbed from the internet altogether and are accessible only in archived form, a CNN analysis shows. Other materials researchers relied on to expose the camp system -- such as government tenders and official documents -- have also been deleted.

Multiple foreign journalists who reported on the camp system have been expelled from China, while academics, activists and survivors who sought to expose its reach have been denounced, and harassed. Those who have dared speak out inside of China have been silenced or detained.

The clampdown has been accompanied by a new, coordinated propaganda campaign touting the successes of the ""vocational training"" system, with heavily choreographed media tours for sympathetic outlets, interviews with ""graduates"" praising the system, and disinformation which aims to sow confusion about the scale of the camp system and the abuses experienced by detainees, while painting Beijing as the victim of both violent extremism and Western misinformation.

Early reports in Chinese state media about de-radicalisation programs in Xinjiang have since been scrubbed from the internet.

Crackdown

Located in the far west of the People's Republic of China, Xinjiang is among China's most ethnically diverse regions. It is home to about 11 million Uyghurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic minority, who speak a language closely related to Turkish and have their own distinct culture, as well as significant populations of Kazakhs.

Rich in natural resources, especially oil and gas, the region has seen a large influx of Han Chinese, the country's majority ethnic group, amid recent, concerted efforts by the government to tie Xinjiang closer to the wider economy.

Xinjiang -- the name means ""New Frontier"" in Chinese -- has long been of strategic importance for its rulers in Beijing. The vast region borders Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Afghanistan, as well as Mongolia and Russia in the north and Pakistan and India in the south. Its importance has only increased with the advent of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative, a trade and infrastructure mega project connecting China to markets across Central Asia to Europe and beyond.

In the 1990s and 2000s, as the number of Han migrating to Xinjiang increased and the government ramped up efforts to integrate the region, protests and occasionally violent ethnic unrest became more common

Information about such incidents was often hard to come by, with reports in state media sporadic and sparsely detailed. Few foreign journalists ever visited Xinjiang, both due to the region's remoteness from Beijing and the harassment and surveillance by local authorities of those journalists who did travel there.

Such controls only increased as the situation became more unstable and the authorities cracked down harder. In 2009, following deadly ethnic riots in the Xinjiang capital of Urumqi, the entire region was cut off from the internet for almost a year, and many Uyghur writers and intellectuals were jailed.

In October 2013 , a group of Uyghurs were alleged to have driven a sports-utility vehicle into pedestrians on Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Five people died in the incident, described by authorities as a terror attack, including three in the car. Some 40 people were injured.

Following the incident, Xinjiang's anti-terrorism budget doubled. The regional government, meanwhile, said it was ""determined to curb the spread of religious extremism as well as prevent severe violent terrorist attacks."" As part of this, what was called ""vocational training"" could be provided to those ""more easily manipulated by religious extremism.""

In early 2014, 31 people were killed, and more than 100 were injured , during a knife terror attack in a crowded train station in Kunming, in China's southwestern Yunnan Province. Four people were convicted of plotting the attack, which the government blamed on Uyghur separatists.

During a visit to the region in April 2014 in the aftermath of the Kunming attack, President Xi called for an all-out ""struggle against terrorism, infiltration and separatism,"" according to leaked internal speeches published by the New York Times

Around this time, in a village in Shufu County, near the ancient Silk Road trading stop of Kashgar in western Xinjiang, local officials identified 16 women in need of ""educational transformation,"" according to the Xinjiang Daily article. Their offense? Wearing the burqa.

These women, one of whom was Hojamet, were initially ""very resistant and unwilling,"" but ""gradually realized the essence and harm of religious extremism,"" eventually choosing to abandon conservative Islamic dress for regular clothing.

Another woman also told the paper her husband had been detained by the police for religious extremism and taken for ""de-radicalization"" in an unspecified location. ""I hope that he will receive a good education, transform well, and reunite with us soon,"" she was quoted as saying.

Cover-up

While in 2014 and 2015 the burgeoning ""re-education"" system was still years away from reaching its current scale, or from becoming public knowledge, it was clear the situation in Xinjiang had escalated following the high-profile Kunming attack.

Visiting the region weeks later, Ursula Gauthier, a journalist with the French magazine L'Obs, reported an intense system of surveillance, police checkpoints, and widespread fear of being reported or denounced among any Uyghurs she spoke to.

""In Xinjiang, where the police respect legal procedures even less than in the (rest of China), arrests are not reported to families. They simply disappear,"" Gauthier wrote , adding many Uyghurs reported being constantly afraid, such that fear ""creeps into all parts of life, poisons relationships and paralyzes the most serene minds.""

This experience was at the forefront of her mind when, about seven months later, ISIS-linked terrorists attacked targets across Paris , killing 130 people and wounding hundreds more.

Disgusted by the bloodshed in her home capital, Gauthier was also dismayed by the reaction from the Chinese government, which she felt was attempting to take advantage of the incident to gain international support for its crackdown in Xinjiang.

In expressing sympathy with France, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China was also a victim of terrorism and complained about a ""double standard"" in the West in which media and politicians minimized or sought to justify terrorist incidents against Chinese.

In a column for L'Obs , Gauthier noted the astonishing outpouring of sympathy and solidarity she had experienced in Beijing from ordinary people, while pointing out what she felt were the Chinese government's ""ulterior motives"" in conflating ISIS attacks with violence in Xinjiang.

While other outlets made similar observations -- ""China Responds to Paris Attacks Through a Domestic Lens,"" read a headline in the New York Times -- Gauthier's article struck a nerve.

The Global Times, a nationalist, state-run tabloid, published multiple articles attacking her, and she was summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to explain herself. She was told to apologize but refused, saying she was being accused of saying things -- such as that Chinese victims of terror deserved to die -- she never wrote.

Fanning the controversy, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang accused Gauthier of having ""blatantly championed acts of terrorism and slaughter of innocent civilians, igniting indignation among the Chinese people.""

The authorities refused to renew her press card , and on January 1, 2016, she flew out of Beijing for good.

Exposed

While she was not alone in criticizing or exposing China's policies in Xinjiang, or even in calling out Beijing's attempt to conflate ethnic unrest with global terrorism, Gauthier appears to have been caught up in a shifting policy on Xinjiang, as the government became far more sensitive to outside scrutiny.

""We know today that Xi Jinping had made the decision to change the policies in Xinjiang, so in (late 2014) they were preparing the crackdown,"" she said. ""It was just the fact that we didn't know back then.""

The scale of this transformation would not be known for several years. Even as people began disappearing into the camp system, which was built up between 2014 and 2017, before massively expanding that year, the heavy surveillance in Xinjiang, ongoing intense censorship of Uyghur issues on the Chinese internet, and its relative remoteness compared to the rest of the country, meant the news did not immediately spread.

But as human rights groups and members of the Uyghur diaspora started reporting increased disappearances and people being taken away for ""political education,"" a number of foreign journalists were able to travel to Xinjiang to see if the stories were true.

In late 2017, a series of on the ground reports were published by US outlets, BuzzFeed , the Associated Press , and the Wall Street Journal , all testifying to the intense surveillance all Uyghurs in Xinjiang were subject to, and to the burgeoning camp system.

""Since this spring, thousands of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities have disappeared into so-called political education centers, apparently for offenses from using Western social media apps to studying abroad in Muslim countries, according to relatives of those detained,"" Buzzfeed's Megha Rajagopalan reported.

While officials defended security measures in Xinjiang as necessary for preventing terrorism, at first, Beijing denied reports about the camp system, with a foreign ministry spokesman telling Rajagopalan ""we have never heard about these measures taken by local authorities.""

A similar denial would come from China's representative to Kazakhstan, who told reporters ""we don't have such a concept at all in China"" when asked about a CNN report on Uyghurs being sent to political education camps in early 2018 . More often, the Chinese authorities simply refused to comment for stories about Xinjiang.

According to a CNN review of Chinese government statements from 2015 onwards, officials largely avoided addressing the issue of Xinjiang until around mid-2018, when growing scrutiny made this impossible.

In particular, China appears to have switched strategies in response to a hearing of the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in August of that year, where it was estimated by the Germany-based World Uyghur Congress that as many as 1 million people could have passed through the camps

China's representative to the committee said this was ""completely untrue,"" while acknowledging people had been assigned ""to vocational educational and employment training centers with a view to assisting in their rehabilitation.""

Speaking in mid 2019 , Liu Xiaoming, China's ambassador to the UK, gave a staunch defense of the program in an interview with the BBC, saying ""extremist ideas have easy penetration to the poorer areas. The idea is to help the people, to lift them out of poverty.""

""They can leave freely. They can visit their relatives. It is not a prison. It is not a camp,"" Liu said.

While China has sought, sometimes successfully, to muddy the waters on Xinjiang, attacking individual researchers and think tanks, and trotting out family members of survivors to criticize them in dubious videos, much of the evidence showing the scale of the camp system is in fact open source.

For example, the growth of a camp in Shufu County, around 7 kilometers (4.5 miles) from Amina Hojamet's village, can be tracked via satellite imagery on Google Earth. The installation was first built around 2013, though it may have initially been used for another purpose. In the years since, it has more than doubled in size, and what appear to be watchtowers can be seen on walls around dormitory-like buildings, according to a review of historical satellite imagery.

Other open source data helps confirm this: a tender for business issued by the Xinjiang government in 2017, reviewed by CNN, seeks a $21 million refit and expansion of the camp -- described as a Legal Education Transformation School.

As scrutiny over Xinjiang increased, reports in state media about the ""de-radicalization"" program, as well government announcements about the various camps and tenders for supplying them appear to have been scrubbed from the internet, with only a small proportion surviving in archived form.

This effort appears to have been inconsistent, with some materials surviving online, along with reports in state media that can be used to track the evolution of the ""vocational training"" system, even as similar articles which had been written about by human rights groups, such as that which contains Hojamet's story, were deleted.

begun In the past year, Chinese state media and officials have attacking researcher Adrian Zenz, who was the first to use government documents to expose the camps, and the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, which popularized the use of satellite imagery to track their growth. Zenz was among multiple academics and politicians in the European Union and United Kingdom sanctioned by China in March.

Beijing has also punished those journalists who helped draw attention to Xinjiang early on. Rajagopalan, the Buzzfeed reporter, was forced to leave China in August 2018 , after her visa extension was denied. Two years later, Gerry Shih and Josh Chin, who wrote early reports on Xinjiang for the AP and WSJ respectively, were among a number of American reporters expelled from China in retaliation for Trump administration limits on US-based Chinese state media.

Pivot

While it would continue to officially deny any ""camps"" exist in Xinjiang, with Foreign Ministry officials reprimanding reporters who used those terms, from late 2018 onwards, there has been a concerted shift in China's messaging on this issue.

In October of that year , the Xinjiang government all but acknowledged reports about the ""re-education"" system were correct, calling on local officials to expand the number of ""vocational skill education training centers"" and ""carry out anti-extremist ideological education.""

The following week, Shohrat Zakir, a high-ranking Xinjiang government official, told state media the Chinese government was fighting ""terrorism and extremism"" in its own way, and in accordance with UN resolutions.

Former detainees, he said, had been transformed for the better by their time in the ""training centers."" Instead of being led by religion as in the past, now they ""realized that they are firstly citizens of the nation,"" Zakir said.

In a white paper published by the State Council Information Office in August 2019, China's top administrative body wrote ""Xinjiang is a key battlefield in the fight against terrorism and extremism in China.""

""(The government) has established vocational education and training centers in accordance with the law to prevent the breeding and spread of terrorism and religious extremism, effectively curbing the frequent terrorist incidents and protecting the rights to life, health, and development of the people of all ethnic groups,"" the paper said, adding ""worthwhile results have been achieved.""

A watchtower on a high-security facility near what is believed to be a re-education camp where mostly Muslim ethnic minorities are detained, on the outskirts of Hotan, Xinjiang, on May 31, 2019.

Sean Roberts, an expert on Central Asia at the George Washington University and author of ""The War on the Uyghurs: China's Internal Campaign against a Muslim Minority,"" said many officials in Xinjiang appeared to have internalized Beijing's narrative on the issue.

""People high up know the real extent of the threat and how minor it is, but I think some of the lower level officials really do believe what they are doing is saving Uyghurs from extremism and terrorism,"" he said.

At the international level, Beijing has leaned on its allies to push back on criticism from western countries over Xinjiang. After a representative for the United Kingdom issued a statement at the UN General Assembly in 2019 on behalf of 23 countries raising concerns about human rights abuses, Belarus made its own statement on behalf of 54 countries voicing approval of China's ""counter-terrorism"" program in Xinjiang. Signatories included close allies of China, such as Russia, Egypt, Bolivia and Serbia.

""They have a kind of hubris about this,"" Roberts said of how China's messaging has evolved since then. ""There's a level of confidence in having escaped a lot of criticism from the international community, a sense that nobody is actually going to punish us for this.""

As well as securing international recognition (of sorts) for its efforts in Xinjiang, Beijing has also sought to link its ""de-radicalization"" program with anti-extremism efforts elsewhere, providing a sheen of legitimacy even in practice the comparisons are rather far-fetched.

Foreign Minister Wang Yi, among other officials, has claimed China's system is in keeping with the UN ""Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism.""

""The Plan of Action suggests early engagement and combining counter-extremism actions with preventive measures,"" Wang said in a 2019 speech. ""That is precisely what Xinjiang has been doing. Visible progress has been made: There has not been a single case of violent terrorism in the past three years.""

That same year , Zakir, the region's top Uyghur official, said ""most (detainees) have already gone back to society.""

""I can say 90% of them have found suitable and enjoyable jobs that bring them considerable income,"" he said, adding many Uyghurs were originally lacking employable skills and jobless, though records kept by overseas Uyghur groups suggest many intellectuals and highly-qualified individuals have also been sent to the camps.

Both French and British programs involve individuals convicted of terrorism offences or on watchlists, and are governed by both domestic human rights law and the European Convention on Human Rights. By contrast, many detainees in Xinjiang are locked up for non-terror related offences , such as breaching family planning regulations, or for religious practices deemed to be indicative of alleged ""extremism,"" such as wearing the burqa, growing a beard, or reading the Quran.

For its part, the UN plan also notes ""violations of international human rights law committed in the name of state security can facilitate violent extremism by marginalizing individuals and alienating key constituencies, thus generating community support and sympathy for and complicity in the actions of violent extremists.""

Government tenders for expanding and stocking internment camps in Xinjiang provided early evidence of the system's size and scope.

Propaganda

Months after censors scrubbed stories like Amina Hojamet's from the internet in an apparent attempt to cover-up evidence of what was going on in Xinjiang, a new wave of propaganda was pushed out by Beijing, emphasizing both the supposed terrorist threat and the success of the government's so-called ""anti-extremism"" program in tackling it.

In a video published by state broadcaster CGTN in late 2019 , one prominent interviewee suggests -- over footage of the 9/11 attacks and the Boston Marathon bombings -- that the response to such attacks in the West may ""have actually served to help the purposes of terrorists and their organizations.""

""In their responses, you can see the main reasons why terrorism has failed to be curbed at the root,"" says Li Wei, a research fellow at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, a government think tank.

During an anti-terrorism symposium held on the sidelines of the UN Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva in 2020, co-sponsored by Beijing's mission to the UN, participants heard how ""China is willing to share the 'Chinese experience' with the international community,"" according to an official write up of the event

This shift may have been motivated by a wave of leaks -- largely unheard of in Chinese politics -- which exposed both the scale of the camps and the largely inconsequential ""offences"" which got detainees sent there, as well as the involvement of President Xi and other top officials in putting the system in place.

While China denounced the leaks, secret speeches credited to Xi published by the New York Times appear to line up with coverage in state media from the time they were given. With Xi so publicly identified as one of the architects of what has since been called a genocide in Xinjiang, China's propaganda bureau may have felt obliged to spin the entire situation as a success.

Xi himself said in September 2020 that the policy followed in Xinjiang has been ""completely correct,"" and called on the government to ""tell the story of Xinjiang in a multi-level, all-round, and three-dimensional manner, and confidently propagate the excellent social stability of Xinjiang.""

A facility believed to be a re-education camp where mostly Muslim ethnic minorities are detained, in Artux, north of Kashgar, on June 2, 2019.

Chinese state media, particularly those outlets targeting foreign audiences, have pushed this line hard. While stories such as Hojamet's were scrubbed from the internet in what may have been a kneejerk reaction to international criticism, they have been replaced by a glut of content showcasing happy, successful graduates from the ""vocational training"" system.

""Through the training, I realized that my past beliefs were completely wrong and religious extremism was our enemy. It's a disease which poisons our body and a drug which leads us to death,"" one woman told reporters at a press conference held by the Xinjiang government. ""I must stay away from religious extremism and lead a normal life.""

Foreign diplomats from countries close to China -- including Iran, Pakistan and Russia -- have been invited to tour Xinjiang, even visiting camps, though representatives from the US and other countries have complained of being denied unfettered access to the region.

China's propaganda organs have also organized tightly-controlled press trips to Xinjiang, again mostly for media thought to be sympathetic, though early on, several international press agencies were invited to visit a camp, resulting in embarrassment for Beijing when they reported the situation there largely matched the testimony of survivors

Such visits have been denounced as ""Potemkin-style propaganda tours for unwitting foreigners"" by Amnesty International, producing a stream of positive stories about the situation in the camps and China's success in fighting terrorism which often blindly repeat official propaganda.

One of the few US publications able to send a correspondent to Xinjiang in recent years was International Focus, a tiny Houston-based magazine which caters to the city's diplomatic community.

According to a piece by publisher Val Thompson from May 2019 , she was invited to go to Xinjiang by the State Council Information Office, joining a multinational group of journalists.

Writing of visiting the government-run ""Exhibition of Major Terrorist Attacks and Violent Crimes in Xinjiang,"" Thompson said the experience was ""eye-opening, I had no idea the PRC was dealing with extremist activity.""

At the Kashgar Vocational Skills Educational and Training Center, she said she interviewed ""several"" detainees, who ""were, or could be, victims of extremist teaching.""

""They were treated well by their supervisors,"" Thompson wrote in her article, which has been promoted online by China's State Council. ""For those who want to believe these young people may have been coerced, I say you can't fake happiness; and happiness is exactly what I saw.""

Thompson and International Focus did not respond to a request for comment.

In recent weeks, China's propaganda organs have ramped up their counter narrative, including producing a musical -- ""The Wings of Song"" -- purporting to show the ethnic harmony that exists in modern Xinjiang.

State broadcaster CGTN, which targets foreign audiences, also dispatched a reporter to Kashgar last month, from where she filed live reports , signing off with the line: ""There's definitely no genocide, so to speak. So Michelle, back to you.""

One video released by CGTN may have made the opposite point however: a new documentary about the threat of ""extremism"" that existed prior to the recent crackdown gave as examples textbooks published and approved by China's own propaganda organs, demonstrating how previously innocuous references to Uyghur culture and Islam have become taboo.

Retaliation

This propaganda push appears to have been successful, particularly in convincing many Muslim majority countries to back Beijing , or at least in giving their leaders cover in doing so.

Not all journalists who were taken on government-run tours of Xinjiang were convinced, however. The experience of Olsi Jazexhi since he first wrote about his trip is indicative of how far China will allegedly go to try and control the narrative over Xinjiang, and tear down those who attempt to challenge it.

A Canadian-Albanian writer and historian, Jazexhi said he wanted to visit Xinjiang after reading reports in Western media which he felt were exaggerated. He was highly suspicious of the involvement of the US government, fearing it was attempting to promote extremism among Uyghurs, or fabricate human rights abuses in order to attack China.

""I'm generally skeptical of Western propaganda about the rest of the world,"" Jazexhi said. ""Very often they lie.""

After showing his writing and YouTube channel to the Chinese embassy in Tirana, the Albanian capital, Jazexhi was approved to join a trip to Xinjiang in August 2019, along with 20 other journalists, most of whom were from Muslim countries, he said.

""The desire of the Communist Party was that when we go back to our home countries we would say things are fine in Xinjiang and the Americans and whoever are lying about the Uyghur issue,"" Jazexhi said.

The Xinjiang capital of Urumqi on October 1, 2020.

At first, landing in Urumqi, he was greatly impressed. The Xinjiang capital had undergone significant development in recent years, and was, in Jazexhi's eyes, ""better built and more beautiful than Toronto.""

But then the real propaganda started, with a series of lectures by Chinese historians and local officials, as well as tours of terrorism exhibits such as that described by Thompson.

A historian of Islam and nationalism, and knowledgeable about Central Asia, Jazexhi was appalled by what he heard.

""The narrative was Xinjiang has always been a part of China and these Turks and Islam are latecomers,"" said Jazexhi. ""It shocked not only me but even other Muslim journalists on the tour. It depicted Islam as a primitive religion, and Uyghurs as invaders and newcomers, who were Islamized by less civilized Arabs.""

Similar claims have been made in Chinese government documents , and in interviews given by officials to state media , such as one where the mayor and deputy Party chief of Urumqi described the idea of Uyghurs being native to Xinjiang as a ""ridiculous, ignorant and condemnable"" fallacy.

""The Uyghur people are members of the Chinese family, not descendants of the Turks, let alone anything to do with Turkish people,"" he added.

Jazexhi's experience in the ""vocational training and education centers"" his tour was taken to visit was even more eye-opening.

After ""being brainwashed for two to three days that China is suffering from Islamic extremism,"" Jazexhi said he expected to come face to face with a Chinese version of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the former leader of ISIS.

Instead, the people he spoke to -- via a government interpreter -- were normal men and women, whose ""only mistake to end up in this detention center was that they had read a history of East Turkestan online, or read the Quran with their mother, or prayed with their father.""

While his Chinese minders said the place was not a prison, Jazexhi said they admitted detainees could not leave, nor could they talk to relatives except via tightly-controlled, weekly video calls.

""It was a prison but it was painted in such a way to give us an impression that it was a school,"" he said. ""When we asked (detainees) questions in Turkish or English they did not dare to respond before asking their Chinese minders what to say.""

In one video taken by Jazexhi during his trip, he spoke with a 23-year-old woman in a camp in Aksu. Through a government interpreter, the woman said she had been detained for ""watching unlawful videos,"" wearing a burqa and encouraging other women in her village to do the same.

He said the stories were ""unimaginable,"" adding that two female journalists from the Middle East, both of whom were veiled, were particularly upset to hear from Uyghur detainees that they were there for wearing a hijab or burqa.

""From our visit to two camps, in Kashgar and Aksu, we saw beyond doubt that China is openly eradicating the Islamic identity and Turkish identity of these people,"" Jazexhi said. ""I went to defend China but I found out I could not defend it.""

When he asked his fellow journalists if they planned to write about what they saw, most demurred, saying they would not be allowed to. Jazexhi's minders, meanwhile, had apparently become aware the trip was not having the desired impression, and began shadowing him ever more closely.

""They were really displeased by our attitude when we were inside Xinjiang, because they understood in a way that they had failed with our group,"" he said. ""They even warned us not to dare to report anything negative because that would be unacceptable.""

Upon returning to Albania and publishing his findings, Jazexhi said he has suffered retaliation from China. A university he taught at canceled his courses, which he said was due to Chinese pressure.

A spokesman for the Xinjiang government accused Jazexhi of being unethical and ""spreading false information,"" while China's ambassador to Turkey denounced an article by Jazexhi as one ""in which facts are distorted and basic knowledge is absent."" Chinese state media suggested Jazexhi was driven by ""malice"" and his actions ""went against the basic professional ethics as a reporter.""

The pushback against Jazexhi, however, is nothing compared to how vociferously Chinese officials have gone after some former detainees, attacking the ""inferior character"" of one woman who had spoken to foreign reporters and publicising her alleged medical history.

Another critic, Gulchehra Hoja, a prominent Uyghur journalist who previously spoke to CNN about her family's experiences in the camp system , said she recently discovered she had been placed on a terrorist wanted list, after China's foreign ministry publicly denounced her and claimed she lied about her parents having been detained.

""It's a completely baseless accusation and it's outrageous,"" she told CNN. ""My only crime is being a journalist reporting on what's happening to the Uyghurs.""

This ""with us or against us"" attitude has ramped up considerably in recent months, with new sanctions passed by Beijing against UK and EU lawmakers and think tanks, as well as numerous boycotts of Western companies such as H&M and Nike which have expressed concern about using Xinjiang cotton in their supply lines.

A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Albania said Jazexhi's claims were ""untrue"" and referred questions about his employment to his former university, which did not respond to a request for comment. His former employer also did not respond.

""All my life I have criticized the Americans, but never have I been blacklisted by the American government, had my name condemned,"" Jazexhi said. ""The Chinese are even more angry with me because they invited me, I was their guest.""

He added that he had been told ""that if I shut up, I would have 'opportunities,' but I said I cannot lie about the horror I've seen, I'm a Muslim.""",5693,35888,9,55

Written by Shamil Shams and Masood Saifullah

After almost two decades since the United States invaded Afghanistan and toppled the Taliban regime, Washington is set to exit the country. President Joe Biden has decided to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan by September 11.

The military withdrawal will not depend on the situation on the ground — despite fears that the Taliban could make major gains, many say.

“The president has judged that a conditions-based approach, which has been the approach of the past two decades, is a recipe for staying in Afghanistan forever,” an official told reporters on condition of anonymity on Tuesday.

Germany will match US plans for the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said in an interview on Wednesday. “We have always said we are going in together, and we are going out together,” Kramp-Karrenbauer told German public broadcaster ARD. “I stand for an orderly withdrawal, and I expect us to decide this today (at NATO).”

Former US President Donald Trump’s administration had set the pullout date for May 1, but Biden’s decision will delay the end of withdrawal by another five months. Biden’s complete and unconditional decision to withdraw comes as a surprise for many experts, who had hoped that his administration would reverse Trump’s policies, which many believe have emboldened Islamist militants in Afghanistan.

A victory for the Taliban?

Violent attacks in Afghanistan have spiked since the signing of the US-Taliban agreement in Doha, Qatar, in February 2020 to end the protracted war. The Taliban deny involvement in these attacks, but their refusal to agree to a nationwide ceasefire has raised doubts about their intentions.

The Islamist group, which feels more powerful than ever, also says it would not attend a planned summit in Turkey until all foreign troops leave the country.

“The result of the upcoming Afghan conference in Turkey will determine how the withdrawal of US troops will impact the future of the country,” Mohammad Shafiq Hamdam, a Kabul-based security expert, told DW. If the conference succeeds in forming a government that includes Taliban and other Afghans, then the damage of such a hurried exit from Afghanistan will be manageable, he continued. “But if the conference fails, and the Taliban continue to reject peace, I am afraid Afghanistan could face an all-out civil war.”

The US decision to pull out all troops from Afghanistan would also leave President Ashraf Ghani’s elected government at the mercy of militants. US intelligence has released a report finding that Afghanistan’s government would “struggle” to stand its ground against the “confident” Taliban.

The US national intelligence report states that the Taliban “is confident it can achieve military victory.”

“Afghan forces continue to secure major cities and other government strongholds, but they remain tied down in defensive missions and have struggled to hold recaptured territory or reestablish a presence in areas abandoned in 2020,” it said.

Analyst Hamdam says that Afghan security forces “are financially and militarily dependent on the US, and without its support, they will be in a tough spot.”

The Taliban are not the only threat to Afghan forces; other militant groups, such as “Islamic State” (IS), have also gained a foothold in the war-ravaged country.

“The Taliban are stronger than ever. IS and other terrorist groups have gained a foothold in Afghanistan. Therefore, the consequences of a hasty and irresponsible withdrawal from Afghanistan could be dangerous not only for Afghanistan but also for the region and the world,” Raihana Azad, a member of the Afghan parliament, told DW.

‘No excuse for war’

Concerns is great that gains made over the past two decades, especially in the area of women’s rights, could be lost as the Taliban unleash further violence. It is unclear whether the Taliban would agree to protecting human rights and freedom of speech in Afghanistan.

“The US has made too many concessions to the Taliban. The Afghan people will pay the price for it. They are disheartened and feel abandoned by the international community,” lawmaker Azad said.

Some experts hold the view that the withdrawal announcement could also put the Taliban into a difficult position. “By announcing an unconditional pullout, the US has accepted Taliban’s main demand. Now the international community expects the Taliban to join the political process. There is no excuse to continue the war,” Assadullah Nadim, a Kabul-based military expert, told DW.

Bigger role for Pakistan?

Biden’s decision to pull out troops from Afghanistan will also give an upper hand to regional players, which are vying for a bigger role in the country. Countries like Pakistan, India, China and Russia have their own strategic interests, which are better served without a US presence in Afghanistan.

Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, who held talks with his German counterpart Heiko Maas in Berlin earlier this week, told DW that Islamabad will remain an important player in the Afghan peace process.

“Pakistan will benefit from peace in Afghanistan. It will open the door to increased trade with Kabul, and many pending development projects can be completed,” he said.

Pakistan has been wary of an increased role of its regional rival India in Afghanistan since the US invaded Afghanistan in 2001.

Experts say that the 2020 US-Taliban deal would not have been possible without Islamabad’s backing. Pakistan has a considerable influence over the Taliban, and it played a key role in bringing the insurgents to the negotiating table.

Yet Pakistan wants a strong role for the Taliban in future Afghan governance. Its regional interests are better served with a powerful Taliban presence in its western neighborhood. This, however, would not guarantee peace in Afghanistan.

“The United States will seek to enforce this order through diplomatic channels,” the Eastern District of New York said in a statement following Judge Eric Vitaliano’s ruling.

Caro Quintero is on the list of the FBI’s 10 most wanted fugitives, with a $20 million bounty on his head.

The United States accuses him of ordering the kidnap, torture, and murder of Drug Enforcement Agency special agent Enrique “Kiki” Camarena in 1985.

Caro Quintero was arrested that year, tried in Mexico, and sentenced to 40 years in prison, but in 2013, a judge released him on a legal technicality and he went into hiding.

0,Is China really about to invade Taiwan? | Politics News,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/14/is-there-really-a-risk-that-china-will-go-to-war-with-taiwan,"Analysts say US military’s warnings about rising threat are more a reflection of the deterioration in the US-China relationship rather than any change on the ground.

Taipei, Taiwan – For the first time in more than half a century, the United States and Japan are expected this week to make a joint statement on the security of the Taiwan Strait following a meeting between US President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.

While largely symbolic, the statement would be an indication of increasing concern about the security of the democratically-run island amid dire public warnings from senior US military officials about the threat of an invasion by Beijing, which claims the island as its own.

Admiral John Aquilino recently told a Senate Armed Services committee that taking Taiwan is a “number one” priority for China’s Communist Party, while US Asia Pacific commander Philip Davidson has said publicly that China could invade in the next six years.

Such fears may seem justified by the threatening tone of the Chinese state media and an escalating number of missions by PLA aircraft into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone (ADIZ).

But on the ground in Taiwan, people are neither running for one of the island’s 117,000 working bomb shelters nor enlisting en masse.

Having lived under the threat of Chinese military action for the past 70 years, the island’s 23 million people have come to understand what they consider the strange paradox of Taiwan’s existence: even as China’s military might grows, invasion does not necessarily come any closer.

Some experts believe much of the threat assessment by the US military may actually be more of a reflection of a shift in US perceptions about China amid the deteriorating relationship between the world’s two economic giants.

Taiwan has been modernising its military, including developing new submarines and warships [Ritchie B Tongo/EPA] “The (Chinese Communist Party’s) hopes for unification with Taiwan have been clear for decades, and (President) Xi Jinping has made clear during his term that use of force is on the table,” said Eric Lee, a research associate at the Project 2049 Institute in Arlington, Virginia.

“This challenge is nothing new. Rather, it reflects an updated threat perception of the CCP and PLA in the context of US strategic competition with China.”

Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), agrees.

The assessments, she says, are based not on intelligence but an analysis of the military balance between the US and China.

‘More difficult than D-Day’

China has stepped up its activities around Taiwan since Tsai Ing-wen was first elected president back in 2016.

While Tsai’s politics at home are viewed as largely maintaining the status quo in Taiwan’s complex relationship with China, abroad she is associated with a push for a unique Taiwanese identity that is separate from its historic ties to China.

Her politics and her administration’s close relationship with the US have angered Beijing, which claims Taiwan as its own despite having never ruled the island.

As part of Taiwan’s push for more political space, Tsai has sought to bolster Taiwan’s defences by raising the defence budget, reforming the reserves, improving its image from historical associations with the martial law era, and purchasing billions of dollars in arms from the US since taking office.

President Tsai was first elected in 2016 and has faced an increasingly assertive China, which claims Taiwan as its own [File: Ritchie B Tongo/EPA] Her administration has also seen a push to revive Taiwan’s domestic weapons manufacturing, including locally-made submarines, armoured vehicles, and military aircraft, according to the Ministry of Defense.

“The CCP has not given up on the use of force to invade Taiwan, and the Chinese military has continued to strengthen its combat readiness, and readiness to increase the CCP’s use of force,” the ministry said in a statement to Al Jazeera.

“There is always a risk of seizing Taiwan. Whether it is a sudden attack… or a full-scale invasion, it will seriously impact the country’s survival and development. Therefore, supporting the defense operations of various military building and preparation work is the core task of the national army.”

In late March, the Ministry of Defense said incursions into Taiwan’s ADIZ had become so frequent that it would no longer scramble to meet the aircraft each time and would instead track them with missiles. The Ministry said the decision was made on the assessment that the flights were consuming resources and increasing the risk of a miscalculation or accident.

And while some, particularly in the US, have begun to speculate that an amphibious invasion by the PLA is somewhere on the horizon, most experts take a more measured approach, stressing that an invasion of Taiwan carries significant risks for China.

First, its forces would have to cross the 180km (100-mile) Taiwan Strait with more than 100,000 soldiers and supplies, according to Michael Tsai, who served as Taiwan’s vice minister of defence and then minister of defence between 2004 and 2008.

En route, they would face aerial and naval bombardment and, if they managed to land, strong local resistance.

“If Taiwan was attacked by the PLA, more than two-thirds of young people would take affirmative action to resist Chinese action,” the former defence minister said. “Taiwan is a free and democratic country. We like to live in a peaceful coexistence with China but if we were attacked we have to react for some defences. Of course, will suffer a lot. Many young people will lose their life, but so will the PLA.”

Taiwanese soldiers in action during the National Army Lunar New Year’s Military Exercise for Preparedness Enhancement inside a military base in Hsinchu in January [Ritchie B Tongo/EPA] There would be other issues to contend with as well, including challenging terrain, unpredictable weather patterns and even typhoons.

For Taiwan expert and historian Bill Sharp, a former visiting scholar at National Taiwan University, such a manoeuvre would be “more difficult than a D-Day Landing” due to Taiwan’s geography, rough waters, and unreliable weather patterns. Its coastline also offers few suitable beaches, he said, for landing “armoured personnel carriers, tanks, artillery, or large numbers of invading troops.”

A missile attack, meanwhile, would lead to a far great of a loss of human life and destruction of infrastructure and would fuel opposition to any invading force.

“China would prefer to rule Taiwan as it physically is,” he said. “With their society violently attacked, Taiwanese will to fight will be piqued.”

Unknown ‘unknowns’

An invasion could also draw in Taiwan’s closest allies, such as the United States and Japan, posing too many unknowns for China’s leadership.

While the US is not guaranteed to come to the island’s defence, it has promised to help the island maintain “sufficient self-defence capabilities” as part of the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act.

CSIS’s Glaser says she does not believe China is yet ready to take such drastic action.

“Every Chinese leader has said reunification is inevitable,” she said. “Xi Jinping’s pronouncements on Taiwan aren’t very different from his predecessors,” she said, adding that China’s latest Five-Year-Plan called for the “peaceful development of Cross-Strait relations” with Taiwan.

Some experts believe much of the threat assessment by the US military may actually reflect a domestic shift within the US in perceptions of China. As China’s relationship with the US has soured, the threat perception of the PLA has also risen, said Project 2049’s Lee.

Mechanics repair F-CK-1 Ching-kuo Indigenous Defence Fighters at an air force base in Tainan in January. The island has stopped scrambling for every Chinese incursion, instead tracking the aircraft with missiles [File: Ann Wang/Reuters] Others also warn that the US’s concern is less for the future of the people of Taiwan than reflective of anxiety about its Island Chain Strategy, a defensive strategy incorporating Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines and other islands to contain China’s expansion into the Pacific and close to the US mainland.

“The US knows that if China took the dominant position in the Asia-Pacific, it would have a detrimental effect against US national interests, so the US will try to defend the ‘first island chain’. Taiwan is in a strategic position as part of the first island chain. If Taiwan lost to China, it could become a PLA naval base that would threaten not only Japan but also US national security interests,” former defence minister Tsai said.

However, experts say Taiwan’s outlying islands could still be targeted.

“To seize Taiwan’s outer islands has always been on PLA’s practice agenda. If you take a look at geography, Taiwan’s outer islands are spread out, the ability to support one another is limited,” said James Huang, a retired Taiwanese lieutenant colonel turned military columnist.

China could easily blockade Taiwan’s port in Kaohsiung by taking its 240-hectare (593-acre) Pratas Island off the coast of Hong Kong or strengthen its position in the South China Sea by invading Taiping Island – also known as Ita Abu – in the Spratly Archipelago.

Huang said other relatively easy targets would include islands close to the Chinese coast including Liang Island and Gaodeng Island, which have few military personnel and are difficult to resupply by Taiwan’s main island.

Psychological warfare

Even if Taiwan may not face its doomsday scenario in the near future, it still faces a range of other challenges.

“Taiwan is no longer China’s main target, but the US is,” Huang said. “In terms of the biggest threat to Taiwan from China, it definitely is not the traditional military invasion.”

He believes Beijing’s focus is crippling Taiwan through economics and trade.

Faced with a weak economy and a strong neighbour next door, during non-COVID times, Taiwan faces a significant brain drain to China with hundreds of thousands opting for more competitive opportunities there.

“By increasing Taiwan’s economic dependence on China, it’s like the boiling frog syndrome, Taiwanese people will let their guard down,” he said.

As well as the regular airspace incursions, Taiwan has also been subject to psychological warfare from Chinese influence operations in the business and political world, and the continual push to squeeze Taiwan out of any international space, from the United Nations to the International Civil Aviation Organisation.

Former US Senator Chris Dodd, former US Deputy Secretary of State Jim Steinberg and former US Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage walk with Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu and American Institute in Taiwan Director Brent Christensen as they arrive in Taipei on Wednesday [Central News Agency/Pool via Reuters] Though less-headline grabbing than a flotilla of PLA aircraft carriers, it could still have a powerful impact, warns Tsai.

“To me and many strategists, we sense that China knows that taking actual military action would be the worst scenario for them as well,” he said. “Therefore, they are taking softer power action, including cyber warfare, psychological warfare, media warfare by penetrating Taiwan and getting disinformation into the newspaper to try to influence and mislead the population and also try to divide them.”

Glaser says rather than fixating on the potential for a Chinese invasion, the US would do better to support Taiwan against many of these other threats.

“The correct policy response by the US is not only to bolster military deterrence – we must make credible our ability to intervene and impose high costs on a PLA invading force – but we must also strengthen the US-Taiwan economic relationship, help Taiwan diversify its trade ties, and knit together a coalition of countries that will promote Taiwan’s participation in the international community and speak out in support of its democracy,” she said.

There are already signs that might be happening.

On Wednesday, as China conducted what it said were “combat drills” near Taiwan, Biden dispatched a delegation of trusted former senior officials to Taiwan. They will meet President Tsai on Thursday.

A statement with Japan will be another part of that process.",1979,12411,10,55

(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. warned Russia of “consequences” if jailed opposition leader Alexey Navalny dies, deepening the conflict over the dissident who has already survived an alleged assassination attempt and is now engaged in the third week of a hunger strike.Navalny’s supporters on Sunday called for demonstrations across Russia on April 21, to coincide with President Vladimir Putin’s state-of-the-nation address. Putin’s most outspoken critic has been imprisoned since March 11 at the notorious IK-2 prison camp about 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Moscow for breaking parole rules. He’d gone to Germany to recover from a near-fatal chemical poisoning in Siberia that he and Western governments blamed on the Kremlin. Russian authorities deny any involvement.“We have communicated to the Russian government...they will be held accountable by the international community,” U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.“We are looking at a variety of different costs that we would impose, and I’m not going to telegraph that publicly at this point. But we have communicated that there will be consequences if Mr. Navalny dies,” Sullivan said.Separately, Ned Price, spokesman for the U.S. State Department, called in a tweet for Russian authorities to immediately provide Navalny with access to “necessary medical care,” while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for the prisoner’s “immediate and unconditional release.”Navalny spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh said Saturday that he might die in a “matter of days.” His doctor, Anastasia Vasilieva, posted a copy of his blood-test results showing what she said were “critical” levels of potassium. “This signifies kidney failure, which can lead at any time to a severe disruption to his heartbeat” including the possibility of heart failure, she said on Twitter.After complaining of acute back and leg pain, Navalny began the hunger strike on March 31 to demand specialist care from doctors outside the prison system. In a post on his Instagram account Friday, Navalny’s allies reported that a prison official had warned him that a blood test indicated a “serious deterioration” in his health and that he would be force-fed if he didn’t end the protest.U.S. SanctionsPresident Joe Biden on Thursday ordered a raft of new sanctions against Russia, including restrictions on buying new sovereign debt, in response to allegations that Moscow was behind a hack on SolarWinds Corp. and interfered with last year’s U.S. election.Yet the moves were calibrated to punish the Kremlin for past behavior while keeping relations from deteriorating further, especially as tensions grow over a Russian military build-up near Ukraine. Biden has offered to meet Putin later this year, an invitation Russia said it responded to “positively.”At the same time, Navalny’s accelerating health crisis has sparked growing criticism in Western capitals.Biden was asked about Navalny’s condition on Saturday. “It’s totally, totally unfair,” he told reporters in brief remarks. Navalny’s fate is in Putin’s hands, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Sunday. The Russian opposition leader’s health is a matter of “great concern,” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told the daily Bild, adding that Berlin “urgently” demands he receive adequate medical care. The European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a statement that the 27-nation bloc was “deeply concerned” about reports of Navalny’s deteriorating state.Russia’s Federal Penitentiary Service didn’t respond to requests for comment. Officials have said previously that Navalny has received all necessary medical attention.Biden pressed Putin in a phone call on Tuesday about the poisoning of the opposition leader, which U.S. intelligence has publicly blamed on Russia’s Federal Security Service. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron also quizzed Putin about Navalny in a March 30 phone call.Asked about the Russian threat to Ukraine in an interview with CBS’s Face the Nation, Macron said that warnings of “red lines” have to be followed up with action. “It’s a failure of our collective credibility vis-à-vis Russia,” he said.Dozens of public figures including five Nobel Literature Prize winners urged Putin in an open letter Friday to ensure that Navalny immediately receives medical treatment. So far, Russia has brushed aside all Western criticism of the case and Kremlin officials refuse even to mention Navalny by name.Even as his condition deteriorates, Russian prosecutors stepped up a crackdown Friday by asking a Moscow court to declare Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation and his Moscow campaign headquarters to be extremist organizations. The opposition group warned that the designation could subject all of its staff and volunteers to criminal prosecution and imprisonment.More than 460,000 people have pledged anonymously to take part in new demonstrations calling for his release, according to a tally on Navalny’s website. Organizers on Sunday abandoned their goal of collecting half a million signatures to schedule a new protest, saying they could no longer wait, and called for the nationwide rallies instead.(Updates with Price, von der Leyen in fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",821,5453,9,55

Qamishli (Syria) (AFP)

Kurdish authorities in northeast Syria on Sunday handed over 34 orphaned children, whose parents were suspected of belonging to the Islamic State group, to a Russian delegation to be repatriated.

An AFP correspondent in the city of Qamishli said the children aged between three and 14 were handed over to a delegation headed by the Russian president's envoy for children's rights, Anna Kuznetsova.

Moscow has now repatriated at least 169 such children, Fener al-Kait of the Syrian Kurds' foreign affairs department told AFP on the sidelines of a handover ceremony.

He said other departures to the Russian Federation of orphaned children would follow from northeast Syria.

Moscow has also been repatriating children abandoned in Iraq since the collapse of the jihadists' ""caliphate"" straddling both Arab states.

Syria's Kurds have repeatedly urged the international community to repatriate foreign nationals held in crowded camps in northeast Syria.

Their calls have largely fallen on deaf ears with only limited numbers, mostly children, allowed to return home so far.

Preliminary results are expected April 25.

Deby is viewed in Europe and the U.S. as a key ally in the fight against terrorism in West and Central Africa. Within the country, though, there have been signs of growing discontent over his handling of Chad’s oil wealth.

Opposition leaders had called on supporters to boycott the vote.

In addition, a group of Libya-based rebels, the Front for Change and Concord in Chad, has been launching attacks. The group attacked a Chadian border post in the north on election day.

Chad’s army said Saturday that it had ""completely destroyed"" the convoy of rebels that attacked the country.

The British government said that two of the rebel group’s convoys were approaching the capital, N’Djamena, Saturday.

BEIJING (AP) — A top Chinese diplomat said Friday that U.S. policy toward China is “too negative” and that cooperation could be critically important as the Biden administration focuses on combatting COVID-19 and promoting economic recovery.

The U.S. appears to be highlighting confrontation and playing down cooperation, Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng said in a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press.

“Such an approach, I must say, is too negative,” he said, adding that it lacks “a forward-looking spirit.”

China could be a partner as Biden tackles the coronavirus and the economy, he said.

“To me it is hard to imagine the two priorities can be resolved without a cooperative and healthy China-U.S. relationship,” he said.

Le also signaled that China is unlikely to make any new pledges at a climate change meeting called by President Joe Biden for next week. He spoke as Biden’s climate envoy, John Kerry, was discussing the issue on the second day of closed-door meetings with Chinese counterparts in Shanghai.

Chinese President Xi Jinping announced last year that China would be carbon-neutral by 2060 and aim to reach a peak in its emissions by 2030.

“For a big country with 1.4 billion people, these goals are not easily delivered,” Le said. “Some countries are asking China to achieve the goals earlier. I am afraid this is not very realistic.”

Le said he had no details on the Kerry meetings in Shanghai.

Biden has invited 40 world leaders, including Xi, to an April 22-23 virtual climate summit. The U.S. and other countries are expected to announce more ambitious national targets for cutting emissions and pledge financial help for climate efforts by less wealthy nations.

Le said that China would convey a positive message at the meeting, but added that China is responding to climate change on its own initiative, not because others asked it to. On whether Xi would join the summit, Le said “the Chinese side is actively studying the matter.”

The U.S. and China are increasingly at odds over a range of issues, including human rights in Tibet and the Xinjiang region, a crackdown on protest and political freedom in Hong Kong, China’s assertion of its territorial claims to Taiwan and most of the South China Sea and accusations Beijing was slow to inform the world about the COVID-19 outbreak that became a devastating pandemic.

China hoped for an improvement in relations under Biden, who succeeded President Donald Trump in January, but the new administration has shown no sign of backing down on hardline policies toward China. The two sides traded sharp and unusually public barbs at the start of talks in Alaska last month.

Le said that after the opening of the Alaska talks, the dialogue was constructive and useful and that both sides are following up on the issues discussed.

The two countries could team up on coronavirus response, he said, but any cooperation must be on an equal basis, an apparent reference to the U.S. pressure on China on multiple fronts.

“It is not one side drawing up a laundry list of demands to the other side,” Le said. “In cooperation, one should not be selfish and care only about one’s own interests with no regard for the well-being of the other side.”

On the same day that a number of Hong Kong pro-democracy activists were sentenced , Le defended China’s crackdown on protest in the semi-autonomous territory. He described the convicted as rioters and said “they deserve what they got.”

He added, “I don’t think it is anything strange if Hong Kong somehow becomes more like a Chinese city because after all Hong Kong is part of China.”

The U.K., U.S. and others have accused Beijing of reneging on a commitment to run the former British colony under a so-called “one country, two systems” framework for 50 years after its 1997 handover to Chinese rule.

Le brushed aside such critiques, saying, “Hong Kong is always China’s Hong Kong and this is something that will not change.”

The vice minister also condemned Western sanctions against companies accused of human rights and labor abuses in Xinjiang. The U.S. blocked imports from several companies operating in the region last year, and added a blanket ban on Xinjiang’s cotton and tomato products in January.

Rather than protecting workers, Le said, “the sanctions have damaged human rights in Xinjiang, resulting in forced unemployment and forced poverty in Xinjiang.”

He also repeated warnings against American government contact with Taiwan, after Biden sent a delegation of former U.S. officials to meet the island’s president this week. China claims self-governing Taiwan as its territory and says, like Hong Kong, it should be under Beijing’s control.

“The U.S. should never try to play the Taiwan card,” Le said. “It is very dangerous. This is our red line. The U.S. should never try to cross it.”

American military officials have warned that China may be accelerating its timeframe for capturing control of Taiwan. Asked if China had a deadline, Le said only that it was a “historical process.”",943,5714,9,55

The European Court of Justice dismissed a Dutch challenge arguing that the EU didn’t take the latest scientific evidence into account when it took the decision two years ago.

The decision will specifically hit the Dutch fishing fleet, which has invested strongly in electric pulse fishing. They argue the technique is environmentally friendly because it allows trawlers to use far less diesel and doesn’t damage the seabed.

Over 80 of the Dutch fleet’s 137 trawlers are equipped for pulse fishing.

Opponents characterize the method as industrial fishing that is wiping out fish stocks.

“The court dismisses the action brought by the Netherlands in its entirety,” the ECJ said in a statement.

The Dutch fishing federation said the decision will lead to bankruptcies in a sector already hit hard by Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Because of the ban on pulse fishing, cost will substantially rise. We already see family firms quitting after generations of fishing. More bankruptcies will come,” the federation said.",197,1230,11,56
0,Castro era in Cuba to end as Raul confirms he's retiring,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/castro-says-he-is-retiring-will-keep-defending-cubas-1959-revolution-2021-04-16/,"Cuban First Secretary of Communist Party Raul Castro Ruz gives a speech, on January 01, 2019, during the celebration of 60th Anniversary of Cuban Revolution at Santa Ifigenia Cemetery in Santiago de Cuba. Yamil Lage/Pool via Reuters/File Photo

Raul Castro confirmed he was handing over the leadership of the Cuban Communist Party to a younger generation at its congress that kicked off on Friday, ending six decades of rule by himself and older brother Fidel.

In a speech opening the four-day event, Castro, 89, said the new leadership would be party loyalists with decades of experience working their way up the ranks and were ""full of passion and anti-imperialist spirit.""

Castro had said at the previous party congress in 2016 it would be the last one led by the ""historic generation"" who fought in the Sierra Maestra to topple a U.S.-backed dictator in the 1959 leftist revolution.

He already handed over the presidency in 2018 to protege Miguel Diaz-Canel, 60, who ran the party in two provinces before joining the national government.

The new generation of leaders, which did not forge itself through rebellion, has no easy task. The transition comes as Cuba faces the worst economic crisis since the collapse of former benefactor the Soviet Union, while there are signs of growing frustration, especially among younger Cubans.

""I believe fervently in the strength and exemplary nature and comprehension of my compatriots, and as long as I live I will be ready with my foot in the stirrups to defend the fatherland, the revolution and socialism,"" Castro told hundreds of party delegates gathered at a convention center in Havana.

The congress, the party's most important meeting, held every five years to review policy and fix leadership, is a closed-door event but excerpts are being broadcast on state television.

Castro himself became acting president when Fidel fell ill in 2006 and later in 2011 party leader, launching a raft of social and economic reforms to open up one of the world's last Communist-run countries that later stalled.

On Friday, he hailed Diaz-Canel as one of the new generation of leaders that was picking up where he left off.

Castro's olive green military fatigues contrasted with the civil get-up of his protege, who is widely expected to succeed him as party first secretary, the most powerful position in Cuba's one-party system.

Older Cubans said they would miss having a Castro at the helm, although most acknowledged it was time to pass on the baton.

""It's another stage,"" said Maria del Carmen Jimenez, a 72-year old retired nurse, ""but without a double we will miss him.""

Castro denounced renewed U.S. hostility under former President Donald Trump. Incumbent President Joe Biden has vowed to roll back some of Trump’s sanctions, although the White House said on Friday a shift in Cuba policy was not among his top foreign policy priorities.

Castro said Cuba was ready for a ""new type of relationship with the United States without ... Cuba having to renounce the principles of the revolution and socialism.""

PRESSURE TO REFORM

Cuba's new leaders face pressure to speed up reform, particularly economic change, which is foremost on citizens' minds, especially younger Cubans who have known only crisis, analysts say.

A tightening of the decades-old U.S. trade embargo and the coronavirus pandemic have exacerbated a liquidity crisis in Cuba's ailing centrally planned economy. Shortages of even basic goods mean Cubans spend hours lining up to buy groceries.

And Havana has dollarized parts of the economy, leaving those who do not receive remittances from family abroad or did not earn hard currency from tourism struggling to get by. That has eaten away at equality, a pillar of the party's legitimacy.

Since the expansion of internet access in recent years, Cubans are increasingly using social media as a platform to express criticism, while online non-state media are challenging the state monopoly of mass media.

Tight control of public spaces by the authorities means protests are still relatively rare and small-scale, but they are on the increase nationwide on issues as varied as excessive red tape to curbs on civil liberties.

Castro said on Friday it was important to pursue reform with greater ""dynamism"", denouncing - as he has in the past - ""inertia, conformism, the lack of initiative"" in state companies. The government has resumed a set of economic reforms the party agreed on at its 2011 congress in recent months, in particular eradicating Cuba's dual currency, multiple exchange rate system in January.

Yet Castro said reforms fomenting the non-state sector should not go beyond certain limits that would lead to the ""very destruction of socialism and the end of national sovereignty.""

Party militants like Rogelio Machado, a mathematics teacher, say they were confident the new generation was up to walking that tightrope.

""Our country need changes and the new generation is more scientifically prepared to continue the path of socialism,"" he said.

But government critics like ""artivist"" Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, whom Havana accuses of being part of a U.S.-backed soft coup attempt, say the death knell is sounding for the revolution.

“Raul is passing over the power to someone with little charisma and who does not have much popular support,” he said while staging his latest performance against the government, in which he sits in a garrote for the four days of the congress. “This takes us one step closer to democracy.”

Speculation via several media outlets – including Australian Financial Review – suggests private equity business, Allegro Funds, could snap up Toll’s business unit which is up for sale.

Allegro, a Sydney-based enterprise founded by Chester Moynihan and Adrian Loader in 2004, recently partnered with Euro Garages Australia and opened its second Pizza Hut kiosk in a New South Wales service station. The move was reportedly part of an initial transformation strategy to boost Pizza Hut Australia’s market share back to the top.

The firm, since investing institutional capital, has managed more than $1 billion of total enterprise value in turnaround and special situation investments.

Allegro currently has investments spanning healthcare, retail, industrial, education, food manufacturing, oil and gas, quick service restaurant, mining, flooring and tourism.

This optimistic acquisition would see Australian ownership rather than an alternative deal with US-based private equity company, Platinum Equity.

If such a deal was to proceed the Australian freight forwarding business, comprising 8,000-plus employees, worth an estimated worth of $3.2 billion would be on the table.

November last year, Toll said in a statement it was exploring the potential sale of Toll Global Express.

The Global Logistics and Global Forwarding businesses, Toll clarified at the time, would not be impacted.

Toll also explained there would be no certainty that such a transaction would occur and will make further announcements on the subject as it deems appropriate.

MOSCOW (AP) — A doctor for imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who is in the third week of a hunger strike, says his health is deteriorating rapidly and the 44-year-old Kremlin critic could be on the verge of death.

Physician Yaroslav Ashikhmin said Saturday that test results he received from Navalny’s family show him with sharply elevated levels of potassium, which can bring on cardiac arrest, and heightened creatinine levels that indicate impaired kidneys.

“Our patient could die at any moment,” he said in a Facebook post.

Anastasia Vasilyeva, head of the Navalny-backed Alliance of Doctors union, said on Twitter that “action must be taken immediately.”

Navalny is Russian President Vladimir Putin’s most visible and adamant opponent.

His personal physicians have not been allowed to see him in prison. He went on hunger strike to protest the refusal to let them visit when he began experiencing severe back pain and a loss of feeling in his legs. Russia’s state penitentiary service has said that Navalny is receiving all the medical help he needs.

Navalny was arrested on Jan. 17 when he returned to Russia from Germany, where had spent five months recovering from Soviet nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin. Russian officials have denied any involvement and even questioned whether Navalny was poisoned, which was confirmed by several European laboratories.

Asked about Navalny’s worsening condition, U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters Saturday: “It’s totally totally unfair and totally inappropriate. On the basis of having the poison and then on a hunger strike.”

Navalny was ordered to serve 2 1/2 years in prison on the grounds that his long recovery in Germany violated a suspended sentence he had been given for a fraud conviction in a case that Navalny says was politically motivated.",442,2767,9,56

The United States and NATO have been alarmed by the build-up at the border and in Crimea, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Last weekend Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan called for an end to the ""worrying"" situation in eastern Ukraine's Donbass region and offered Ankara's support. read more

Russia subsequently said Turkey and other nations should not feed ""belligerent sentiment"" in Ukraine.

Speaking in an interview on broadcaster NTV, Cavusoglu said NATO member Turkey had good ties with both Russia and Ukraine.

""We are making the same call to both countries for issues to be resolved peacefully,"" he said. ""We are not picking sides between the countries. Our stance is clear: balanced and constructive.""

Turkey has forged close cooperation with Russia over conflicts in Syria, Libya and Nagorno-Karabakh, as well as in the defence and energy areas. But it criticised the annexation of Crimea and supports Ukraine's territorial integrity. It also sold drones to Kyiv in 2019.

Last week Turkey said the United States would send two warships to the Black Sea, in a move Russia called an unfriendly provocation. On Wednesday Turkish diplomatic sources said Washington had cancelled the deployment. read more

Cavusoglu said Washington had informed Ankara of the decision. He said any future deployment would require a 15-day notice period under the 1936 Montreux Convention, which grants Turkey control over the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits that connect the Black Sea and Mediterranean, and limits warships' access.

Data from Alibaba's online travel agency platform Fliggy showed that flights from second-tier cities to hot destinations are much cheaper than those from large cities, with an economy-class seat going for 2,250 yuan from Shanghai to Sanya but 570 yuan from Ningbo to Sanya.

As far as hotel reservations are concerned, Ctrip data showed that rooms booked for May Day holiday increased by 43 percent from the same period in 2019 and rooms of some top hotels are all booked.

Lan Xiang, Qunar's data research director, said that hotel reservations have increased during this year's Spring Festival period due to the travel demands after the restraints.

""Although many people visited relatives and travel during the Qingming Festival, many are still choosing to travel during the May Day holiday because of the length of the holiday,"" Lan said.

According to the vacation rental provider Airbnb, as of April 5, searches for rooms available from April 30 to May 4 at large cities and hot tourist destinations were about 10 times of that in 2020.

Under the premise of continuous effective epidemic prevention and control, some tourist spots in Shanghai, Zhengzhou of Central China's Henan province and Sichuan province have started to cancel the limits of visitors.

Ctrip data showed that as of April 14, people booking tickets at tourist spots increased by 114 percent from 2019, and the online platform predicted that ticket booking will enter an explosive period in next two weeks.",447,2766,10,56
0,Sputnik V: How Russia's COVID vaccine is dividing Europe,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-56735931,"Sputnik V: How Russia's Covid vaccine is dividing Europe By Kevin Connolly

BBC News, Brussels Published 2 days ago

image copyright EPA image caption Several European countries have shown interest in Sputnik although the EU's medicines agency is yet to approve it

It's no coincidence that Russia has christened its Covid vaccine Sputnik V. The first time the world learned the meaning of the Russian word Sputnik was in 1957 when the Soviet Union launched the first man-made satellite into orbit.

At the height of the Cold War this startling evidence of Moscow's scientific and technical capabilities came as a huge shock to Western powers, which had assumed they enjoyed a comfortable technological lead over the Soviets.

Critics of the Putin administration were sceptical when the vaccine was given regulatory approval in Moscow as early as last August.

That scepticism, though, has faded. Because once again Russian scientists have surprised the West.

A Russian 'tool of soft power'

An Eastern European diplomat, from a country that regards Russia as a clear and present threat, put it to me like this: ""The search for vaccines in 2020 was rather similar to the race for space flight in the 1950s. Once again many outsiders have underestimated Russia. This is potentially the most powerful tool of soft power that Moscow has had in its hands for generations.""

That word ""potentially"" is important here.

Sputnik V has not yet been approved by the EU's European Medicines Agency. But it's already been ordered by many different countries from Argentina and Mexico to Israel and the Philippines, and Russian officials say they have signed deals to produce it in South Korea and India.

image copyright Getty Images image caption Sputnik 1 was the first man-made satellite to orbit Earth, launched by the Soviets in 1957

There has been the odd hiccup in the rollout.

Argentinian President Alberto Fernández tested positive for Covid-19 in April after receiving two doses of Sputnik in January and February. That's a reminder that even if the Gamaleya Institute's claimed efficacy rate of 91.6% turns out to be true, a small statistical risk remains among those who've been vaccinated.

In Europe, though, the Sputnik vaccine has created problems that are more political than epidemiological.

The EU struggles to speak with a single, convincing voice on Russia.

That's partly a matter of history and geography. Lithuania and Poland are naturally more likely to consider Russia a threat than are, say, Portugal and Malta.

And there's also the perennial problem of balancing the EU's status as an importer of Russian gas with the EU's desire to punish Russia over issues like the attempted murder of leading opposition figure Alexei Navalny or the military build-up on the border of Ukraine.

Adding European reliance on Russia for vaccine supplies into that mix is going to make the relationship harder than ever to balance.

Reuters The European Medicines Agency has publicly confirmed it has to date not received any application for a marketing authorisation for Sputnik V, despite reports stating the opposite

And yet Europe, or at least parts of Europe, are beginning to turn to Moscow out of frustration at the EU's painfully slow vaccine rollout.

'You have to think of your own interests'

Hungary has already bought and distributed considerable quantities of Sputnik V. France and Germany, among many others, are at least prepared to consider it, if and when the European Medicines Agency gives its approval. Hungary has used its right as an independent member state to grant emergency authorisation.

EPA The EU Commission said it would not sign contracts [for Sputnik] like for other manufacturers such as BioNTech, for example, so I said... we will hold bilateral talks with Russia

Veteran French diplomat Pierre Vimont, who's now a senior fellow at Carnegie Europe, says it's perfectly rational for member states to think about buying Sputnik.

""Even when you're facing an adversary,"" he told the BBC, ""you have to think of your own interests.""

Mr Vimont, as you'd expect of a man who's held some of his country's most important diplomatic postings, suggests that the European Union's attitude should be one of cautious pragmatism. That means acknowledging the excellence of Russian science but waiting for EMA authorisation as well.

He makes the point that countries using the jab on the basis of their own approval could face political difficulties with their own voters if things go wrong.

How Sputnik row brought down a prime minister

The case of Slovakia offers a salutary warning to others.

Its Prime Minister, Igor Matovic, secretly arranged to import 200,000 doses of the Russian vaccine. He was forced to leave his post late last month because he'd failed to consult his coalition partners.

image copyright EPA image caption Mr Matovic, here tendering his resignation to Slovakia's President Zuzana Caputova, has now become finance minister

Then Slovak scientists claimed the doses sent to Bratislava were different to samples of the vaccine sent elsewhere, prompting the Russians to denounce the claim as fake news and demand the return of the shipment. An offer from Hungary to approve the doses on Slovakia's behalf added a further layer of complexity.

Russia normally has to spend huge amounts of money on computer hacking and disinformation to spread discord and uncertainty in Europe. Now the vaccine appears to be achieving something similar without any effort.

Pierre Vimont of Carnegie says the Putin administration will be pleased. ""I'm sure they are enjoying this,"" he said, ""let's not be fooled. The use of vaccines by Russia and by China is a diplomatic instrument, a tool for soft power. Playing {EU} member states off against each other is naturally important to Russia.""

A notable victory for Russia

There was a similar reaction from our Eastern European diplomat, who fears that European actions over cases like the poisoning of Alexei Navalny are generally too weak.

""What the vaccines episode shows,"" he told me, ""is that we are quite capable of tying ourselves in knots over our dealings with Moscow without any help from the Russians.""

There is a long way to run with all of this.

image copyright EPA image caption Russia says Sputnik vaccines produced in Serbia could be exported around the region ""at a later stage""

Russia still has a lot to do to increase production of its vaccine even as it boldly takes orders all over the world. This week it announced it was starting production of the drug in Serbia, the first European country outside Russia and Belarus.

It may also be planning to license production in Western Europe as well as India. But there's still the need for EMA authorisation: will the Russian data and the way it was collected meet EU standards?

But for now there is no doubt that Russia has scored a notable scientific and political victory.

The original Sputnik changed the world. Sputnik V may not represent an achievement on quite that scale but it is certainly helping to change the way Russia is perceived.

REUTERS/Dan Williams/File Photo

JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Israel and Greece have signed their biggest ever defence procurement deal, which Israel said on Sunday would strengthen political and economic ties between the countries and the two countries’ air forces launched a joint exercise.

The agreement includes a $1.65 billion contract for the establishment and operation of a training centre for the Hellenic Air Force by Israeli defence contractor Elbit Systems over a 22-year period, Israel’s defence ministry said.

The training centre will be modelled on Israel’s own flight academy and will be equipped with 10 M-346 training aircraft produced by Italy’s Leonardo, the ministry said.

Elbit will supply kits to upgrade and operate Greece’s T-6 aircraft and also provide training, simulators and logistical support.

“I am certain that (this programme) will upgrade the capabilities and strengthen the economies of Israel and Greece and thus the partnership between our two countries will deepen on the defence, economic and political levels,” said Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz.

The announcement follows a meeting in Cyprus on Friday between the UAE, Greek, Cypriot and Israeli foreign ministers, who agreed to deepen cooperation.

The Israeli and Greek air forces on Sunday launched a joint exercise in Greece, the Israeli military said.

In at least one past exercise over Greece, Israeli fighter planes practised against an S-300 posted on Crete. The Russian-made air defence system is also deployed in Syria and Iran, Israel’s foes.

A source in the Hellenic National Defence Command said the S-300 had not been activated in the joint exercise that began Sunday.",291,1864,9,56

Pentagon scientists have invented a microchip that once inserted under the skin will detect if the patient develops Covid-19.

And they have also developed a revolutionary filter that can remove the virus from the patient’s blood through a dialysis machine.

Researchers at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) say they have been working for years on ways to prevent and to end pandemics.

Their work on the microchip was revealed on 60 Minutes on CBS on Sunday night.

Retired Colonel Matt Hepburn, an army infectious disease physician leading DARPA’s response to the pandemic, showed off the technology on the show.

The idea for the invention came after 1,271 infections were recorded on board the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier in 2020.

The microchip, which does not track movements, is carried in a tissue-like gel and is designed to continuously test the patient’s blood.

“You put it underneath your skin and what that tells you is that there are chemical reactions going on inside the body, and that signal means you are going to have symptoms tomorrow,” explained Col Hepburn.

And he added: “It’s like a ‘check engine’ light.

“Sailors would get the signal, then self-administer a blood draw and test themselves on site.

“We can have that information in three to five minutes. As you truncate that time, as you diagnose and treat, what you do is you stop the infection in its tracks.”

Col Hepburn also told the show that his team had invented a filter that if placed on a dialysis machine would remove the virus from blood.

He said that the four-day treatment had been given to “Patient 16”, the spouse of a military member, who was in organ failure and septic shock.

“You pass it through, and it takes the virus out, and puts the blood back in,” said Col Hepburn.

And he said that within days of the treatment the patient had made a full recovery.

The treatment has now been approved by the FDA for emergency use and has been used to treat almost 300 sick patients.

Story continues

The body was originally known as the Advanced Research Projects Agency and was created in 1958 by president Dwight Eisenhower in response to the Russian launch of Sputnik the year before.

China, with a population of more than 1.4 billion people, is offering free eggs, coupons and discounts on groceries to get people to receive the vaccine, The Associated Press reported.

China is using five different vaccines in order to vaccinate its population and has just gotten to the point where millions of people are being vaccinated per day.

However, the head of China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention said that two of the Chinese vaccines they are using “don’t have very high protection rates” against the virus.

The low efficacy rates are one reason Chinese citizens could be discouraged from getting the vaccine.

The country’s handling of the virus could be contributing to the lack of urgency among its citizens to get the vaccine as well, since China has been successful in containing the virus and preventing outbreaks, AP noted.

The country’s vaccine rollout has been slow considering they must vaccinate at least a billion people to reach herd immunity.

The country has done such a good job at containing the virus that its economy grew by almost 20 percent in the first quarter of 2021.

Fioramonti, from the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, is the government’s most vocal supporter of green policies and was criticised by the opposition in September for encouraging students to skip school and take part in climate protests.

In an interview in his Rome office on Monday, Fioramonti said all state schools would dedicate 33 hours per year, almost one hour per school week, to climate change issues from the start of the next academic year in September.

Many traditional subjects, such as geography, mathematics and physics, would also be studied from the perspective of sustainable development, said the minister, a former economics professor at South Africa’s Pretoria University.

“The entire ministry is being changed to make sustainability and climate the centre of the education model,” Fioramonti told Reuters in the interview conducted in fluent English.

“I want to make the Italian education system the first education system that puts the environment and society at the core of everything we learn in school.”

Fioramonti, 42, the author of several books arguing gross domestic product should no longer be used as the main measure of countries’ economic success, has been a target of the right-wing opposition since becoming a minister in the two-month-old government of 5-Star and the centre-left Democratic Party.

His proposals for new taxes on airline tickets, plastic and sugary foods to raise funds for education were strongly attacked by critics who said Italians were already over-taxed.

He then sparked fury from conservatives when he suggested crucifixes should be removed from Italian classrooms to create a more inclusive environment for non-Christians.

Despite the criticism, the government’s 2020 budget presented to parliament this week included both the plastic tax and a new tax on sugary drinks.

“I was ridiculed by everyone and treated like a village idiot, and now a few months later the government is using two of those proposals and it seems to me more and more people are convinced it is the way to go,” Fioramonti said.

ANTI-SALVINI

Surveys showed 70-80% of Italians backed taxing sugar and flights, he said, adding that coalition lawmakers had told him they would table budget amendments to introduce his proposal to hike air ticket prices before the budget is approved by end-year.

Fioramonti said targeted taxes of this kind were a way of discouraging types of consumption which were harmful to the environment or individuals, while generating resources for schools, welfare or lowering income tax.

In this vein, he suggested other levies on various types of gambling and on profits from oil drilling.

His progressive positions on the economy and the environment are the antithesis of Matteo Salvini’s hard-right League, which has overtaken 5-Star to become easily Italy’s most popular party, with more than 30% of voter support.

Fioramonti said the new government, which has got off to a shaky start with weeks of bickering over the budget, “will only last if it is brave,” and stops letting Salvini set the news agenda.

“I want to represent the Italy that stands against all the things that Salvini does,” Fioramonti said. “We have to build a different narrative and not be afraid of saying something Salvini may not like, because that’s why we exist.”",588,3728,9,56

WASHINGTON (AP) — The State Department on Saturday ordered non-essential diplomats at the U.S. Embassy in Chad to leave the African nation due to potential insurgent attacks on the capital.

In addition to non-essential embassy staff, the department also ordered the families of American personnel stationed there to leave because armed groups appear to be moving on the capital of N’Djamena.

CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — A woman who served a 10-year sentence in U.S. prison for lying about her role in the 1994 Rwandan genocide to obtain American citizenship, and then lost her bid for a new trial, has been deported to the East African nation and is likely to face prosecution there.

Beatrice Munyenyezi, who a U.S. judge said “was actively involved” in the killing of Tutsis in Rwanda, was convicted and sentenced in 2013 in New Hampshire. It was her second trial; the first jury could not reach a verdict. Munyenyezi served a 10-year sentence in Alabama and had faced deportation.

She lost her latest court battle in March, when the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a federal district judge’s rejection of her petition challenging how the jury was instructed during her trial in federal court in New Hampshire.

ADVERTISEMENT

Her lawyer, Richard Guerriero, confirmed in an email Saturday that Munyenyezi had been deported to Rwanda. She arrived Friday and was handed over to Rwandan authorities, according to state-run media there.

“Her deportation means a lot in terms of justice delivery to genocide victims,” said Thierry Murangira, spokesperson for the Rwanda Investigation Bureau, according to The New Times.

Munyenyezi is accused of seven crimes connected to the genocide, including murder and complicity in rape, according to Rwandan investigators. She will be detained as investigations continue and her case sent to prosecutors, the newspaper reported.

In the United States, Munyenyezi was convicted of lying about her role as a commander of one of the notorious roadblocks where Tutsis were singled out for slaughter. She denied affiliation with any political party, despite the leadership role of her husband, Arsene Shalom Ntahobali, in the extremist Hutu militia party.

She requested a new trial based on a U.S. Supreme Court decision that came in 2017, well after her sentencing, and limited the government’s ability to strip citizenship from immigrants who lied during the naturalization process.

Munyenyezi alleged that the jury was given inaccurate instructions on her criminal liability. A judge denied her request, saying that even if the instruction fell short, the error was harmless.

As part of her appeal, Munyenyezi’s trial lawyers, who are now New Hampshire superior court judges, said in court documents that they would have presented Munyenyezi’s case differently if the U.S. Supreme Court decision had been law during her trial.

They added that they believe if the jury had been instructed based on the court decision, “the verdict may have been different.”

“Having served her sentence and lost her appeal, she was removed from the country,” Guerriero said in a statement. “It is possible a further challenge to her conviction may be filed despite her removal.”

Munyenyezi fled to Nairobi, Kenya, with a young daughter in July 1994 in the waning days of the genocide. She gave birth to twin girls there four months later. She entered the United States as a refugee and settled in Manchester, New Hampshire’s largest city.

She got a $13-an-hour job working for the city housing authority and earned an associate’s degree in college. She financed a comfortable lifestyle through mortgages, loans and credit cards, but filed for bankruptcy in 2008 and had about $400,000 in debt discharged.

Ntahobali and his mother were convicted of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes of violence and are serving life sentences. Both were deemed to be high-ranking members of the Hutu militia party, which orchestrated the attacks on Tutsis.

U.S. District Judge Steven McAuliffe, who sentenced her, said Munyenyezi “was not a mere spectator.”

He added, “I find this defendant was actively involved, actively participated, in the mass killing of men, women and children simply because they were Tutsis.”

McAuliffe acknowledged that Munyenyezi led a crime-free and productive life since her arrival in New Hampshire, but said it was a life lived under false pretenses.",788,4892,10,56
0,How To Cut Your Inheritance Taxes (Best 5 Ways) for 2021,https://wikyi.com/how-to-cut-your-inheritance-taxes-best-5-ways/,"Best Way On How To Cut Your Inheritance Taxes

If you believe that your estate may need you to pay inheritance tax, we’ve gathered for you 5 simple and easy ways to reduce taxes significantly. Here are the best 5 ways to reduce tax without changing anything in your will. Here are 5 ways on How To Cut Your Inheritance Taxes :

You might be able to win against Inheritance Tax by simply giving away your estate, setting up a trust or changing your will. But be careful to pay attention to any legal consequences you may have afterwards.

If you are married or are in a civil partnership, you can give anything you own at the moment to your wife/husband or civil partner, in some states or countries this will not be possible if the other person was not born in the same country or the amount you may be limited to a specific amount. Using this method you will not have to pay Inheritance Tax on the price of the gift/s.

Some of the rules when gifting are complicated so you might need to take some legal advice.

The second advice on How To Cut Your Inheritance Taxes is : When you give anything to one of your friends or a family member that you are not married to, the price of the gift will still be included in your Inheritance Tax for your assets, but only for the next 7 years.

Thus, if giving your children some money and then living more than 7 years, it will not be taken into consideration when calculating the inheritance tax after your death.

The catch is that you can give away only limited amounts of money every single year so that you will not have to pay inheritance tax.

So, you can give away no more than $3000 a year, but you can give to your children and/or grandchildren when they are getting married.

But the thing is that you need to be aware of Capital Gains Tax as sometimes you may need to pay for certain estate.

The safest route is by checking with your lawyer or accountant if you are not sure if you need to pay Capital Gains Tax or not.

The third advice on How To Cut Your Inheritance Taxes is : If you put in a trust a part of your money, property or things that you have invested into out of witch no children of yours or spouse will be able to benefit from, you will no longer need to pay Inheritance Tax for it.

So, you can set up a trust for your legal (over 18) children, pay for your grandchildren education or even pay for a family member’s medical bills.

You can make a trust right now or you can put it in your will. How To Make Your Will – Step By Step Guide

There again can be Capital Gains Tax consequences if you transfer certain estate into a trust during your life, but no Capital Gains Tax will exist if you create a trust in your will

Keep in mind the fact that a few types of trusts can be subjected to their own tax regimes and the trust might be subjected to its own inheritance tax.

Also, persons that benefit from a trust are likely to have to pay 45% on Income Tax and 28% Capital Gains Tax.

Some rules about trusts can be complicated so you should seek advice from an expert.

The forth advice on How To Cut Your Inheritance Taxes is : Everything that you give to a charity will be free of inheritance tax, thus it can be a good way to reduce your inheritance tax, and at the same time do a good cause.

If you are going to leave 10% of your assets to charity, it will cut how much inheritance tax is due on the rest.

That way, the calculation rate for the inheritance tax sill be only 36%, instead of 40%.

The rate is going to be against the balance of the assets that exceed $325 000, but it can be lowered by gifting certain assets.

You may think that this is not a big saving, but it means that your family and your friends are going to receive more stuff than they would otherwise, and at the same time a charity will also benefit.

If you are going to take out the life insurance policy, it will not reduce the amount of inheritance tax to pay on your estate, but the payout may make it easier for your family and/ or friends to pay the taxes.

0,The IMF won’t let Venezuela access its share of new SDRs,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/4/16/venezuela-shunned-out-of-5b-handout-in-imfs-new-reserves,"Venezuela isn’t able to access its existing SDR holdings and won’t be able to use new ones until a government gains official recognition, an IMF spokesman told Bloomberg News.

The International Monetary Fund won’t hand over $5 billion of special drawing rights to Venezuela to bolster its reserves as part of a massive injection of resources to member nations, due to an ongoing dispute over whether President Nicolas Maduro is the legitimate leader of the country.

Venezuela in theory would be among the biggest recipients in terms of percentage of gross domestic product of a proposed $650 billion in special drawing rights that the IMF is planning to give countries to boost global liquidity. This is part of an effort to help emerging and low-income nations deal with mounting debt and Covid-19.

Some Republicans in Congress, including Senators Pat Toomey and John Kennedy, have urged U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to oppose the creation of the reserves, saying they would reward Maduro, among other U.S. adversaries.

But Venezuela won’t be able to access the assets, which most nations will receive via a transfer to their central banks if they are approved as expected by the Fund’s board of governors in the coming months, according to the IMF. That’s because the U.S. and more than 50 other countries regard opposition leader Juan Guaido as the nation’s legitimate leader, following sham presidential elections in 2018.

“The ongoing political crisis in Venezuela has led to a lack of clarity in the international community — as reflected in the IMF’s membership — regarding official government recognition,” IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said in reply to questions from Bloomberg News.

Venezuela isn’t able to access its existing SDR holdings and won’t be able to use new ones “until a government is recognized,” Rice said.

The decision is the latest setback for Maduro’s regime, which has been largely cut off from a global financial network due to U.S. sanctions. After seven years of economic contraction following a collapse in global oil prices, the IMF’s handout of $5.1 billion would have been equivalent to 81% of the nation’s existing international reserves.

Maduro administration officials are considering whether to invite IMF officials to inspect the government’s economic data — a step known as an Article IV evaluation — in an effort to mend the relationship following a 14-year data blackout that left most economists guessing the depths of the nation’s monumental collapse, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.

Yet, because the Maduro government is barred from having contact, discussions or access to financing from the IMF until it’s recognized as the official government, that Article IV evaluation can’t presently take place.

Press officials for Venezuela’s presidency did not respond to requests for comment.

While the IMF suspended Venezuela’s access to SDRs in 2019 citing political chaos, the relationship between the two has long been contentious. In 2007, late President Hugo Chavez pledged to cut ties with the Washington organization, contending that the Fund merely served U.S. interests.

“This is the kind of initiative that a country like Venezuela could really take advantage of in the face of the ongoing crisis,” said Temir Porras, a former senior economic aide to Chavez and Maduro. “It’s time for a more pragmatic approach, not just to immediately attend to urgent health needs, but to contribute to the stabilization of our economy.”

Venezuela SDR holdings had fallen more than 99% from their allocated level as of last month, down to just $12.5 million from $3.6 billion in 2009, when it was a recipient of reserves during the global financial crisis, according to IMF data. More than two-thirds of Venezuela’s foreign reserves are in the form of gold, which has been difficult to sell because of U.S. sanctions.",626,3892,11,56

Over 400 financial firms in Britain have shifted activities, staff and a combined trillion pounds ($1.4 trillion) in assets to hubs in the European Union due to Brexit, with more pain to come, a study from New Financial think tank said on Friday.

""We think it is an underestimate and we expect the numbers to increase over time: we are only at the end of the beginning of Brexit,"" the study said.

The EU has offered Britain little in the way of direct market access for financial services, which were not included in the bloc's trade deal with the United Kingdom from January.

""That access is unlikely to be forthcoming, so it is perhaps better for the industry to take the damage from Brexit on the chin and focus instead on recalibrating the framework in the UK so that it is more tailored to the unique nature of the UK financial services industry,"" the study said.

Some 7,400 jobs have moved from Britain or been created at new hubs in the EU, the study said. Bankers have told Reuters that some staff moves have been delayed due to COVID-19 travel restrictions.

The total of 440 relocations is higher than anticipated and well above the 269 in New Financial's 2019 survey. New Financial believes the real number is well over 500.

DUBLIN WINNER

Dublin has emerged as the biggest beneficiary with 135 relocations, followed by Paris with 102, Luxembourg 95, Frankfurt 63, and Amsterdam 48.

""This redistribution of activity across the EU has wound the clock back by about 20 years,"" the study said.

Banks have moved or are moving over 900 billion pounds in assets from Britain to the EU, while insurers and asset managers have transferred over 100 billion pounds in assets and funds, reducing the UK tax base.

""We expect Frankfurt will be the 'winner' in terms of assets in the longer-term, and that Paris will ultimately be the biggest beneficiary in terms of jobs,"" the study said.

Amsterdam toppling London as Europe's biggest share trading centre since January has been the most visible sign of Brexit in finance.

The study expects that 300 to 500 smaller EU financial firms may open a permanent office in Britain, far fewer than the prevailing forecasts of around 1,000.

The City of London will remain the dominant financial centre in Europe for the foreseeable future, but its influence will be chipped away, risking a reduction in Britain's 26 billion pounds annual trade surplus in financial services with the EU, the study added.

0,Qatar stocks soar on plan to allow full foreign ownership,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/15/qatar-stocks-soar-on-plan-to-allow-full-foreign-ownership,"Qatari stocks jumped the most in a year after the country said it could allow foreign investors to fully own listed firms – a move that could trigger nearly $1.5bn in inflow.

Qatari stocks rose the most in a year after the country said it may allow foreign investors to fully own listed companies, a move that could trigger more than $1 billion of overseas inflows.

The cabinet approved a draft law that will allow overseas investors to own up to 100% of listed companies, according to the state-run Qatar News Agency. If the law is implemented, companies would have to individually approve the increased limit.

While implementation is yet to be confirmed, the decision could trigger inflows of about $1.5 billion into listed companies that would earn bigger representation in global benchmarks, according to estimates by investment bank EFG-Hermes. The QE Index gained 2.8% Thursday, the most in more than a year, to close at the highest level since Jan. 14.

Stocks that could benefit the most include Qatar Islamic Bank SAQ, Masraf Al Rayan QSC and the Commercial Bank of Qatar, the investment bank said. Their shares climbed 8.3%, 5.5% and 10% on Thursday, respectively, leading gains among members of the main gauge.

The gas-rich nation is following similar decisions by other Gulf countries as they seek to attract inflows from abroad. In 2019, the United Arab Emirates said it would allow foreigners to own 100% of businesses across industries and Saudi Arabia removed a cap on ownership of publicly traded companies for foreign strategic investors.

The proposal is “another milestone on the path to liberalising the economy, with Qatar setting the foreign ownership standard for the region,” said Akber Khan, senior director of asset management at Al Rayan Investment in Doha.

The ministers also announced the extension of pandemic-prompted financial support for private businesses, particularly the extension of a guarantee program that allowed some companies to borrow money interest-free to pay salaries and rent through the end of September. Restaurants, salons and other recreational venues closed earlier this month as the country tightened restrictions to combat a second wave of the coronavirus.

“With the loan-deferral program extending further, businesses will have more time to improve cash flow before lenders assess the ability of customers to pay down deferred dues and it allows for more loan restructuring,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Edmond Christou. Qatari banks have relatively low ratios of non-performing loans, but data on first-quarter earnings suggests they’ve edged higher, he added.

(IRIB via AP, File)

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran named a suspect Saturday in the attack on its Natanz nuclear facility that damaged centrifuges there, saying he had fled the country “hours before” the sabotage happened.

While the extent of the damage from the April 11 sabotage remains unclear, it comes as Iran tries to negotiate with world powers over allowing the U.S. to re-enter its tattered nuclear deal and lift the economic sanctions it faces.

Already, Iran has begun enriching uranium up to 60% purity in response — three times higher than ever before, though in small quantities. The sabotage and Iran’s response to it also have further inflamed tensions across the Mideast, where a shadow war between Tehran and Israel, the prime suspect in the sabotage, still rages.

ADVERTISEMENT

State television named the suspect as 43-year-old Reza Karimi. It showed a passport-style photograph of a man it identified as Karimi, saying he was born in the nearby city of Kashan, Iran.

The report also aired what appeared to be an Interpol “red notice” seeking his arrest. The arrest notice was not immediately accessible on Interpol’s public-facing database. Interpol, based in Lyon, France, declined to comment.

The TV report said “necessary actions” are underway to bring Karimi back to Iran through legal channels, without elaborating. The supposed Interpol “red notice” listed his foreign travel history as including Ethiopia, Kenya, the Netherlands, Qatar, Romania, Turkey, Uganda and the United Arab Emirates.

The report did not elaborate how Karimi would have gotten access to one of the most secure facilities in the Islamic Republic. However, it did for the first time show authorities acknowledging an explosion struck the Natanz facility.

There was a “limited explosion of a small part of the electricity-feeding path to the centrifuges’ hall,” the TV report said. “The explosion happened because of the function of explosive materials and there was no cyberattack.”

Initial reports in Israeli media, which maintain close relations to its military and intelligence services, blamed a cyberattack for the damage.

The Iranian state TV report also said there were images that corroborated the account of an explosion rather than cyberattack offered by security services, but it did not broadcast those pictures.

The report also showed centrifuges in a hall, as well as what appeared to be caution tape at the Natanz facility. In one shot, a TV reporter interviewed an unnamed technician, who was shown from behind — likely a safety measure as Iranian nuclear scientists have been assassinated in suspected Israeli-orchestrated attacks in the past.

“The sound that you are hearing is the sound of operating machines that are fortunately undamaged,” he said, the high-pitched whine of the centrifuges heard in the background. “Many of the centrifuge chains that faced defects are now under control. Part of the work that had been disrupted will be back on track with the round-the-clock efforts of my colleagues.”

In Vienna, negotiations continued over the deal Saturday with another meeting of diplomats from Iran and the five powers that remain in the deal, with expert-level working groups on sanctions-lifting and nuclear issues set to continue activities through to next week.

Iran’s negotiator told state TV that the talks had entered a new phase, adding that Iran had proposed draft agreements that could be a basis for negotiation.

“We think that the talks have reached a stage where parties are able to begin to work on a joint draft,” Abbas Araghchi said. “It seems that a new understanding is taking shape, and now there is agreement over final goals.”

Enrique Mora, the European Union official who chaired the talks, tweeted that “progress has been made in a far from easy task. We need now more detailed work.”

The 2015 accord, which former President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from in 2018, prevented Iran from stockpiling enough high-enriched uranium to be able to pursue a nuclear weapon if it chose in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.

Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful, though the West and the IAEA say Tehran had an organized military nuclear program up until the end of 2003. An annual U.S. intelligence report released Tuesday maintained the longtime American assessment that Iran isn’t currently trying to build a nuclear bomb.

Iran previously had said it could use uranium enriched up to 60% for nuclear-powered ships. However, the Islamic Republic currently has no such ships in its navy.

The attack at Natanz was initially described only as a blackout in its electrical grid — but later Iranian officials began calling it an attack.

One Iranian official referred to “several thousand centrifuges damaged and destroyed” in a state TV interview. However, no other official has offered that figure and no images of the aftermath have been released.

Saturday’s attacks hit what the military described as “terror targets” operated by Gaza’s ruling faction Hamas.

The rare remains were discovered in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, according to a statement from Historic England, a public body that looks after the country's historic environment, published Thursday.

Archeologists were drafted in to work on the project because Iron Age and Roman remains had been found at the site, but the findings ""were far more significant than anticipated,"" said Historic England.

They include a circular central room with various rooms built off it, as well as a bath house. Archeologists believe the large complex of buildings could have been a luxury villa, a religious sanctuary or a mixture of both.

The remains will be preserved in an open public space on the new housing development. MAP Archaeological Practice

""These archaeological remains are a fantastic find and are far more than we ever dreamed of discovering at this site,"" said Keith Emerick, inspector of ancient monuments at Historic England. ""They are already giving us a better knowledge and understanding of Roman Britain.""

It took less than two weeks for the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan to vaccinate almost all of its eligible population.

The country's vaccination campaign kicked off on March 27. By April 8, according to the Ministry of Health, 93% of eligible adults had gotten their first dose. Officials said 472,139 people between ages 18 and 104 had been vaccinated as of that date, and they urged other eligible individuals to follow suit.

In a statement, Health Minister Dasho Dechen Wangmo described the campaign as a ""sense of purpose that each of us is embracing to protect our country and the people we love."" She urged individuals to get vaccinated to protect themselves and their communities — as well as King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck.

""His Majesty the King has shared thoughts about taking the vaccine only after every eligible person in the country received their shots safely,"" she said. ""All of us must come forward, so that we make way for His Majesty to receive the vaccine as soon as possible.""

Overall, roughly 64% of Bhutan's 735,553 residents have been vaccinated so far. That puts the nation's rollout just behind that of Seychelles, which has vaccinated 66% of its population of nearly 100,000, according to The Associated Press.

Health officials said second doses will be administered after eight to 12 weeks. The country received 550,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, known locally as Covishield, in two batches in January and March from India, Daily Bhutan reported.

Bhutan launched its vaccination campaign at the end of last month to coincide with ""auspicious dates in Buddhist astrology,"" the AP said. On March 27, a 30-year-old bureaucrat became the country's first COVID-19 vaccine recipient, followed by Prime Minister Lotay Tshering, his family members and various cabinet ministers.

""Given the infection rate of the disease, we need above 70 percent coverage in order to attain the desired herd immunity,"" Tshering said in a statement. ""With the overwhelming support of all Bhutanese, we will be one of the first countries to achieve that.""

The vaccines were distributed to more than 1,200 sites across the country using cold-chain storage that the AP says was used during earlier vaccination drives. Nearly 3,300 health workers and 4,400 citizen volunteers known as desuups were deployed across the country to help with the rollout, the Health Ministry said.

More than 85% of the country's eligible adults had received their first dose within seven days, officials said. While the formal vaccination campaign was set to last only one week, shots were still available at certain health centers for people who had not received them, and individuals with mobility issues can sign up for home-based vaccinations until Tuesday.

State-owned newspaper Kuensel stated in an editorial that the country's efforts to fight the coronavirus pandemic have been ""exemplary right from the beginning,"" thanks to leadership, front-line workers and what the paper describes as a cooperative public.

While noting it's premature to celebrate before people have had their second doses, it said that the country's size had certainly contributed to the vaccine's successful rollout — and that this has implications for tackling other issues related to the economy, unemployment and technology.

""As we realise the advantage of our smallness from the vaccination programme, it is a lesson too valuable to not replicate in our other endeavours,"" it concluded.

As of Monday, the country had recorded 921 cases and one death from COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. Health officials said there will be no changes to public health restrictions until at least two weeks after the country completes a rollout of second-dose vaccinations, in two to three months.",631,3939,10,57

Concerns over Navalny's health have mounted against the background of a new spike in tensions between Moscow and the West over a litany of issues, including Russia's troop build-up on Ukraine's border, interference in U.S. elections and other perceived hostile activities. Navalny's team on Sunday called for massive protests across Russia on Wednesday evening, just hours after Putin is set to deliver his state of nation address. ""It's to time to act. We are talking not just about Navalny's freedom but his life,"" Navalny's right-hand man Leonid Volkov said on Facebook.

Volkov said Wednesday's rally could become a decisive battle against ""absolute evil"" or Russia's last opposition rally for years to come. ""Call on all your acquaintances and take to central squares,"" wrote Volkov, who heads Navalny's regional offices, adding that the protests should be massive. 'Won't be allowed to die' There was no immediate reaction from the Kremlin but the Russian ambassador in London, Andrei Kelin, said Navalny ""will not be allowed to die in prison."" ""But I can say that Mr. Navalny, he behaves like a hooligan,"" Kelin told the BBC. Authorities have ramped up pressure on Navalny's supporters in recent months, detaining more than 10,000 protesters at opposition demonstrations in January and February. On Friday, Russian prosecutors asked a court to label Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation and the network of his regional offices as ""extremist"" organizations, in a move that would outlaw them in Russia and could result in jail time for their members or even supporters.

Navalny was arrested in January on returning to Russia after recovering from a near-fatal poisoning attack he says was orchestrated by the Kremlin. The Kremlin denies the allegation. The Putin critic is serving two and a half years on old embezzlement charges — which he says are politically motivated — in a penal colony in the town of Pokrov around 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Moscow. Navalny began a hunger strike on March 31 to demand proper medical treatment for back pain and numbness in his legs and hands. On Saturday, Navalny's doctors said his health had rapidly deteriorated and demanded prison officials grant them immediate access. ""Our patient can die any minute,"" cardiologist Yaroslav Ashikhmin said, pointing to Navalny's high potassium levels and saying he should be moved to intensive care.

The bill is led by House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry Nadler, subcommittee Chair Hank Johnson, and first-term Rep. Mondaire Jones. In the Senate, the bill is being championed by Ed Markey of Massachusetts.

Congressional Democrats plan to unveil legislation expanding the size of the Supreme Court on Thursday, according to three congressional sources familiar with the closely held measure.

The number of justices on the court, which is set by Congress, has fluctuated throughout the course of the nation’s history, reaching as many as 10 seats before settling on nine in 1869. In 2016, Sen. Ted Cruz suggested that if Hillary Clinton were elected, the Republican Senate should keep Justice Antonin Scalia’s seat empty, effectively bringing the number of justices down to eight.

Republicans currently hold six seats, while Democrats hold just three. Republicans were able to solidify control of the court under former President Donald Trump, after first refusing to advance Merrick Garland’s nomination under former President Barack Obama and then confirming Justice Neil Gorsuch after Trump’s election. Then after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died last September, Republicans threw out the procedures they had previously embraced and confirmed Justice Amy Coney Barrett in a matter of weeks.

After Trump’s nomination of Barrett, then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer faced pressure to stop her confirmation by any means necessary. When those myriad options fell short and Barrett was pushed through, the conversation turned to expanding the court.

“Not only do these extremist judges threaten more than a century of progressive achievements,” read a letter to Schumer by 20 New York elected officials, “they threaten to foreclose the possibility of any future progress under a Democratic administration.”",294,1913,10,57

China said Friday it has expressed “serious concerns” to the United States and Japan over what it calls negative moves and collusion between the two countries against China.

The statement from Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian came just before President Joe Biden welcomed Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to the White House on Friday in his first face-to-face meeting with a foreign leader.

That meeting is seen as reflecting Biden’s emphasis on strengthening alliances to deal with a more assertive China and other global challenges.

Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing that Japan and the United States should “take China’s concerns and demands seriously, avoid words and actions that interfere in China’s internal affairs and harm China’s interests.”

“China has no objection to the development of normal bilateral relations between Japan and the United States, but such relations should help enhance mutual understanding and trust among regional countries and contribute to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, and should not target or harm the interests of third parties,"" Zhao said.

China would “make necessary responses as appropriate,"" he said.

Biden and Suga see their meeting as a chance to counter messaging from Chinese President Xi Jinping that America and democracies in general are on the decline, after the political turmoil and backing away from global leadership that marked Donald Trump’s presidency.

Japan remains China's traditional rival dating from Tokyo's brutal WWII occupation of much of the country. Relations between Washington and Beijing are tenser than ever over trade, technology, Hong Kong, Taiwan and human rights, particularly China's policies toward Turkic Muslims in the northwestern region of Xinjiang.

U.S. and Chinese naval movements in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea, which China claims virtually in its entirety, have added to tensions in recent days, following statements from U.S. officials that Beijing may be accelerating its schedule to annex Taiwan by force.

The Biden administration says the primary challenge for the United States lies in managing U.S. policies toward the Indo-Pacific, the main theater in which China is flexing its growing economic and military power. That helped guide Biden’s decision, announced this week, to pull U.S. troops out of Afghanistan and free the administration to focus more on East Asia.

According to a BBC report and a Facebook post, a woman in Krakow, Poland, called her local animal help center, asking for help with something caught in a tree earlier this week:

The full story in the caption gets a bit long, but apparently the woman told officials that ""this creature … he's been sitting in a tree across the block for two days! People don't open windows because they're afraid it's going to enter their house!""

After some description, she suggested it might be an iguana (""legwan"" in Polish).

The officials had to confirm that it wasn't an April Fool's Day prank.

The woman then needed to know they were kneaded on site to fix things immediately. After all, as the storyteller (the post is on the Facebook page for the Krakow Animal Welfare Society, which was reporting from Inspector Adam's ""Inspector's Diary"") explained, maybe someone threw an animal out and it landed in the tree. Perhaps it really was a legwan.

So experts came out, did a search of the neighborhood and there it was, the creature.

A croissant.

D'ough!

Inspector Adam suggested that the pastry was probably tossed out a window to feed the birds, ""and the poor guy got stuck in the fork of lilac twigs (He was sitting there and looked pretty good, releasing his imagination, taking on reptilians, he was almost moving, he was already preparing for the invasion, he was already beginning to look like a dragon child, the surrounding virgins were already trembling....""

Seems like Inspector Adam has a vivid imagination.

So do fans of the agency; one artist, Rynn Rysuje, even created a croissant-creature-legwan drawing that perfectly sums up the hilarity of the situation:

That said, the post did wrap up on a serious note, urging citizens to call when something seems concerning: ""It's better to check and be pleasantly disappointed, sometimes (unfortunately very rarely) laugh, than not react, which can sometimes lead to a tragedy.""

Alas, we have no idea what happened to the creepy croissant. Perhaps it was given to the birds. Perhaps Inspector Adam ate it. We hope someday that there will be a follow-up.

It's the yeast they could do.

0,Researchers integrate human stem cells into monkey embryo,https://www.dw.com/en/researchers-integrate-human-stem-cells-into-monkey-embryo/a-57224980,"A team of scientists from China and the United States has reached a breakthrough in the field of stem cell research. The scientists injected human stem cells into monkey blastocytes, an early structure in embryonic development in mammals. The team around lead researcher Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte then managed to keep some of the embryos made up of two different genetic materials alive for up to 20 days. A ""mixed"" organism like this is also known as chimeric, or an interspecies chimera.

Izpisua Belmonte and his team at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in California cooperated with a group of Chinese researchers led by Weizhi Ji at Kunming University of Science and Technology in Yunnan. Their study on chimeric human-primate embryos was published on Thursday in the renowned natural science journal Cell.

Chimeras in mammals have been made since the 1970s to study early developmental processes. The difference: Back then, scientists used rodents, and the interspecies organisms usually didn't survive for very long. The big step that made the new study possible came last year when the Chinese team at Kunming University developed technology that allowed monkey embryos to stay alive and grow outside the body for an extended period of time.

""Historically, the generation of human-animal chimeras has suffered from low efficiency and integration of human cells into the host species,"" Izpisua Belmonte said. The advances now published in Cell will help scientists understand better how chimeras work and in turn, how to improve them for further research.

The macaque's blastocyst, an early stage of embryonic develpment, after researchers inserted human stem cells

That's how it's done ― but what about the why?

Mixing human stem cells with animals' genetic material is a significant intervention into nature's course, but the researchers say they have good reason for it.

""As we are unable to conduct certain types of experiments in humans, it is essential that we have better models to more accurately study and understand human biology and disease,"" Izpisu Belmonte explained.

In Cell, the study's authors further explain that their work generating chimera with human stem cells ""might constitute a promising strategy for various regenerative medicine applications, including the generation of organs and tissues for transplantation.""

The work of Izpisu Belmonte and his colleagues has been harshly criticized, too, though.

""I think the research is of very low quality,"" Alfonso Martinez Arias, an affiliated lecturer in the department of genetics at the University of Cambridge, said in a comment on the study provided to the independent Science Media Centre in the UK. From looking at the researchers' data, Martinez Arias said, ""it is impossible to see what they say is there.""

Cell is a peer-reviewed journal, meaning that each study that is published undergoes a rigorous process in which a panel of scientists reviews the material and results provided by the study's authors. The fact that Izpisu Belmonte's work was published in Cell means that none of the experts reviewing it shared Martinez Arias' concerns.

With science's progress, more and more things become possible ― but ethical concerns remain.

What is a human being?

That still leaves ethical questions. In the current study, the embryos didn't survive past 20 days. But what happens when science eventually gets to the point that chimeras like these turn into fully formed beings?

""This research opens Pandora's box to human-nonhuman chimeras,"" Julian Savulescu, Director of the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics at the University of Oxford, said in his comment to the Science Media Centre. To him, the key ethical question relates to what kind of creatures these chimeras would be ― to what extent can they think and feel? Would it be acceptable to take organs from them that were grown for transplant purposes?

""What is the moral status of these novel creatures?"" Savulescu wrote. ""Before any experiments are performed on live-born chimeras, or their organs extracted, it is essential that their mental capacities and lives are properly assessed.""

Anna Smajdor, associate professor of practical philosophy at the University of Oslo, even went a step further.

""This breakthrough reinforces an increasingly inescapable fact: biological categories are not fixed ― they are fluid,"" she said in her comment to the Science Media Centre. ""The scientists behind this research state that these chimeric embryos offer new opportunities, because 'we are unable to conduct certain types of experiments in humans'. But whether these embryos are human or not is open to question.""",739,4684,8,57

Four people were killed and 20 wounded in a car bomb attack on Thursday in the Sadr City neighbourhood of Baghdad, Iraqi police and medical workers said.

The car was parked at a busy second-hand equipment market in the mainly Shi'ite Muslim district, police said.

An Iraqi military statement said the blast had killed one civilian, wounded 12 others and set several vehicles on fire. A second statement by the military said only one person, the driver, had died. Medics in Sadr City put the death toll at four.

Black smoke rose from the market place after the blast and ambulances rushed to save the wounded, Reuters witnesses said. Police cordoned off the site of the blast shortly afterwards.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. It was the second big deadly bombing to hit Baghdad this year after a suicide attack claimed by Islamic State militants killed at least 32 people in a crowded market in January.

Large bomb attacks, once an almost daily occurrence in the Iraqi capital, have halted in recent years since Islamic State fighters were defeated in 2017, part of an overall improvement in security that has brought normal life back to Baghdad.

The January blast was the most deadly in three years.

Thursday's attack comes during an election year, a time when tension between rival Iraqi political groups has often caused violence.

The populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, after whom Sadr city is named and who commands a following of millions of Iraqis, counts among his enemies both Islamic State and rival Shi'ite parties with militias backed by Iran.

On Wednesday, separate violence linked to regional rivalries saw an explosives-laden drone target U.S. forces at Iraq's Erbil airport in northern Iraq and a separate rocket attack kill a Turkish soldier at a military base nearby. read more

BEIJING (AP) — China said Friday it has expressed “serious concerns” to the United States and Japan over what it calls negative moves and collusion between the two countries against China.

The statement from Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian came just before President Joe Biden welcomes Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to the White House on Friday in his first face-to-face meeting with a foreign leader.

That meeting is seen as reflecting Biden’s emphasis on strengthening alliances to deal with a more assertive China and other global challenges.

Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing that Japan and the United States should “take China’s concerns and demands seriously, avoid words and actions that interfere in China’s internal affairs and harm China’s interests.”

“China has no objection to the development of normal bilateral relations between Japan and the United States, but such relations should help enhance mutual understanding and trust among regional countries and contribute to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, and should not target or harm the interests of third parties,” Zhao said.

China would “make necessary responses as appropriate,” he said.

Biden and Suga see their meeting as a chance to counter messaging from Chinese President Xi Jinping that America and democracies in general are on the decline, after the political turmoil and backing away from global leadership that marked Donald Trump’s presidency.

Japan remains China’s traditional rival dating from Tokyo’s brutal WWII occupation of much of the country. Relations between Washington and Beijing are tenser than ever over trade, technology, Hong Kong, Taiwan and human rights, particularly China’s policies toward Turkic Muslims in the northwestern region of Xinjiang.

U.S. and Chinese naval movements in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea, which China claims virtually in its entirety, have added to tensions in recent days, following statements from U.S. officials that Beijing may be accelerating its schedule to annex Taiwan by force.

The Biden administration says the primary challenge for the United States lies in managing U.S. policies toward the Indo-Pacific, the main theater in which China is flexing its growing economic and military power. That helped guide Biden’s decision, announced this week, to pull U.S. troops out of Afghanistan and free the administration to focus more on East Asia.",569,3594,9,57
0,Hong Kong Court Sentences Pro-Democracy Leaders to Prison,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/world/asia/hong-kong-martin-lee-jimmy-lai.html,"HONG KONG — Jimmy Lai has skewered the Chinese Communist Party for decades. The 73-year-old founder of a fiercely pro-democracy newspaper in Hong Kong, Mr. Lai helped give voice to critics of the city’s leaders and their bosses in Beijing, winning friends in Washington and other places along the way.

Now, for one of his acts of defiance, Mr. Lai is going to prison.

A Hong Kong court on Friday sentenced Mr. Lai to 12 months in prison for his role in a peaceful demonstration in 2019 against Beijing’s encroachment over the semiautonomous territory. Three activists and a labor leader were given sentences of eight to 18 months for their role in the protest.

Other prominent opposition figures received suspended sentences, meaning they would avoid being put behind bars if they are not convicted of another crime in the next two years. They included Martin Lee, an 82-year-old lawyer who is often called Hong Kong’s “father of democracy,” who was given an 11-month suspended term.

The sentences fell short of the maximum of five years in prison the defendants had faced. Still, they sent an unmistakable message that activism carries severe risks for even the most internationally prominent opposition figures. Supporters of the defendants say the sentences are the latest sign of the fundamental transformation that Beijing has sought to impose on Hong Kong, once a bastion of free speech, to silence dissent.",233,1417,8,57

Concern is mounting that the long-simmering conflict in east Ukraine could spiral back into wider fighting after reports of major Russian troop movements and an intensification of clashes with Moscow-backed separatists.

The troop build-up along Ukraine's northern and eastern borders, as well as on the Crimean peninsula annexed by Moscow in 2014, comes amid a spike in violence along the front line between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces in the east of the country.

Zelensky is expected to travel to Paris on Friday to discuss the rising tensions with French President Emmanuel Macron.

The two leaders will be joined by German Chancellor Angela Merkel by video link, Macron's office said.

Ahead of the trip Zelensky urged NATO and the European Union to speed up Ukaine's membership process.

""We cannot stay indefinitely in the EU and NATO waiting room,"" the Ukrainian leader told the French daily Le Figaro.

""The time has come to step up a gear, to invite us to join the EU and NATO,"" he added, denouncing Russia's ""violent aggression"" against his country, in comments run on the newspaper's French language website.

The foreign ministers of EU members Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania arrived in Kiev on Thursday and European Council President Charles Michel spoke with the Ukrainian leader in a show of support.

Speaking alongside the visiting diplomats, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told reporters that rhetoric in Moscow had reached a fever pitch with pundits and officials issuing ""dehumanising"" statements aimed at intimidating Kiev.

""They are openly threatening Ukraine with war and the destruction of Ukrainian statehood,"" Kuleba said.

""The red line of Ukraine is the state border. If Russia crosses the red line, then it will have to suffer,"" Kuleba said in English.

Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told reporters: ""Ukraine will never be on its own.""

The United States has reiterated its backing and on Thursday European Council President Michel ""conveyed the EU's unwavering support"" in phone talks with Zelensky, according to a readout of the call.

The foreign ministers of the EU will discuss Ukraine on Monday, Brussels said.

On Friday, Macron will receive Zelensky for lunch in Paris, the Elysee said.

""It's an important meeting,"" the 43-year-old Ukrainian leader said after a meeting of the country's security council. He said the situation in the east was ""under control.""

""The army is ready, that's the most important thing,"" he added.

Together with Russia, France, Germany and Ukraine form the Normandy format of countries that have sought and failed to resolve the conflict since 2015.

On Wednesday, US President Joe Biden and Merkel agreed to call on Russia to reduce its troops on the border with Ukraine.

Russia dismissed the pressure.

Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that Western countries including Germany and France should ""stop participating in the propaganda campaign surrounding Russian activity on Russian territory that does not threaten anybody"".

Kuleba's warning on Russia came after international observers to the conflict said late Wednesday that there had been a dramatic increase in recent violations that was hindering their work.

""The number of violations recorded over the past two weeks has reached its highest level this year,"" monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe said in a statement.

An uptick in fighting since the start of the year has seen Moscow and Kiev blame each other for the rise in violence between government forces and separatists in eastern Ukraine.

Ukraine says the spate of clashes has cost the lives of nearly 30 Ukrainian servicemen and left at least another 68 wounded since January.

Kiev warned this week that 28,000 separatist fighters and more than 2,000 Russian military instructors and advisers are currently stationed in eastern Ukraine, while nearly 33,000 soldiers are deployed in Crimea.

Russia's defence ministry, however, said those troops were merely responding to ""threatening"" NATO actions by participating in military drills that would conclude in three weeks.

The renewed fighting has left in tatters a ceasefire brokered last July that had brought relative calm to the conflict.

""We are not afraid. Ukraine itself is strong enough and has reliable friends to defend its statehood,"" Kuleba said.",731,4697,8,57
0,"Multiple rockets hit Iraqi airbase, wounding two soldiers",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/18/multiple-rockets-hit-iraqi-airbase-wounding-two-soldiers,"At least five rockets target Balad airbase, north of Baghdad, which hosts US contractors and Iraqi security forces.

At least five rockets hit the Iraqi military airbase at Balad north of Baghdad, wounding two Iraqi soldiers, the Iraqi military said in a statement.

Security officials had said earlier that the Katyusha rockets had fallen on the area of the base that houses US contractors, and that no casualties had been reported.

No group immediately claimed the attack on Sunday, but armed groups that some Iraqi officials say are backed by Iran have claimed similar incidents in the past.

US officials have blamed Iranian-backed militias for regular rocket attacks aimed at US facilities in Iraq, including the US Embassy in Baghdad.

The last attack on the Balad airbase was on April 4, when at least two rockets fell in the sparsely populated surrounding area.

F-16 aircraft are stationed at the airbase and several maintenance companies are present there, employing Iraqi and foreign staff.

The attack comes few days after an explosives-laden drone targeted US-led coalition forces near a northern Iraq airport, causing a large fire and damage to a building.

The incident was the latest in a string of attacks targeting mostly US installations in Iraq in recent weeks.

There have been about 20 bomb or rocket attacks against American interests, including bases hosting US soldiers, since US President Joe Biden took office in January.

Dozens of others took place from the autumn of 2019 under the administration of Donald Trump.

American forces withdrew from Iraq in 2011 but returned in 2014 at the invitation of Iraq to help battle ISIL (ISIS) after the group seized vast areas in the north and west of the country.

In late 2020, US troop levels in Iraq were reduced to 2,500 after withdrawals based on orders from the Trump administration.

Calls grew for further American troop withdrawals after a US-directed drone strike killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and an Iraqi militia leader in Baghdad in January 2020.

Last month, a base in western Iraq housing US-led coalition troops and contractors was hit by 10 rockets. One contractor was killed.

The US last week committed to withdrawing all remaining combat forces from Iraq, although the two countries did not set a timeline for what would be a second US withdrawal since the 2003 invasion which toppled Saddam Hussein.

The announcement came as the Biden administration resumed a “strategic dialogue” with the government of Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, who is seen as too close to Washington by pro-Iranian groups.",423,2603,8,57

RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — The global death toll from the coronavirus topped a staggering 3 million people Saturday amid repeated setbacks in the worldwide vaccination campaign and a deepening crisis in places such as Brazil, India and France.

The number of lives lost, as compiled by Johns Hopkins University, is about equal to the population of Kyiv, Ukraine; Caracas, Venezuela; or metropolitan Lisbon, Portugal. It is bigger than Chicago (2.7 million) and equivalent to Philadelphia and Dallas combined.

And the true number is believed to be significantly higher because of possible government concealment and the many cases overlooked in the early stages of the outbreak that began in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019.

When the world back in January passed the bleak threshold of 2 million deaths, immunization drives had just started in Europe and the United States. Today, they are underway in more than 190 countries, though progress in bringing the virus under control varies widely.

While the campaigns in the U.S. and Britain have hit their stride and people and businesses there are beginning to contemplate life after the pandemic, other places, mostly poorer countries but some rich ones as well, are lagging behind in putting shots in arms and have imposed new lockdowns and other restrictions as virus cases soar.

Worldwide, deaths are on the rise again, running at around 12,000 per day on average, and new cases are climbing too, eclipsing 700,000 a day.

“This is not the situation we want to be in 16 months into a pandemic, where we have proven control measures,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, one of the World Health Organization’s leaders on COVID-19.

In Brazil, where deaths are running at about 3,000 per day, accounting for one-quarter of the lives lost worldwide in recent weeks, the crisis has been likened to a “raging inferno” by one WHO official. A more contagious variant of the virus has been rampaging across the country.

As cases surge, hospitals are running out of critical sedatives. As a result, there have been reports of some doctors diluting what supplies remain and even tying patients to their beds while breathing tubes are pushed down their throats.

The slow vaccine rollout has crushed Brazilians’ pride in their own history of carrying out huge immunization campaigns that were the envy of the developing world.

Taking cues from President Jair Bolsonaro, who has likened the virus to little more than a flu, his Health Ministry for months bet big on a single vaccine, ignoring other producers. When bottlenecks emerged, it was too late to get large quantities in time.

Watching so many patients suffer and die alone at her Rio de Janeiro hospital impelled nurse Lidiane Melo to take desperate measures.

In the early days of the pandemic, as sufferers were calling out for comfort that she was too busy to provide, Melo filled two rubber gloves with warm water, knotted them shut, and sandwiched them around a patient’s hand to simulate a loving touch.

Some have christened the practice the “hand of God,” and it is now the searing image of a nation roiled by a medical emergency with no end in sight.

“Patients can’t receive visitors. Sadly, there’s no way. So it’s a way to provide psychological support, to be there together with the patient holding their hand,” Melo said. She added: “And this year it’s worse, the seriousness of patients is 1,000 times greater.”

This situation is similarly dire in India, where cases spiked in February after weeks of steady decline, taking authorities by surprise. In a surge driven by variants of the virus, India saw over 180,000 new infections in one 24-hour span during the past week, bringing the total number of cases to over 13.9 million.

Problems that India had overcome last year are coming back to haunt health officials. Only 178 ventilators were free Wednesday afternoon in New Delhi, a city of 29 million, where 13,000 new infections were reported the previous day.

The challenges facing India reverberate beyond its borders since the country is the biggest supplier of shots to COVAX, the U.N.-sponsored program to distribute vaccines to poorer parts of the world. Last month, India said it would suspend vaccine exports until the virus’s spread inside the country slows.

The WHO recently described the supply situation as precarious. Up to 60 countries might not receive any more shots until June, by one estimate. To date, COVAX has delivered about 40 million doses to more than 100 countries, enough to cover barely 0.25% of the world’s population.

Globally, about 87% of the 700 million doses dispensed have been given out in rich countries. While 1 in 4 people in wealthy nations have received a vaccine, in poor countries the figure is 1 in more than 500.

In recent days, the U.S. and some European countries put the use of Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine on hold while authorities investigate extremely rare but dangerous blood clots. AstraZeneca’s vaccine has likewise been hit with delays and restrictions because of a clotting scare.

Another concern: Poorer countries are relying on vaccines made by China and Russia, which some scientists believe provide less protection than those made by Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca.

Last week, the director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention acknowledged the country’s vaccines offer low protection and said officials are considering mixing them with other shots to improve their effectiveness.

In the U.S., where over 560,000 lives have been lost, accounting for more than 1 in 6 of the world’s COVID-19 deaths, hospitalizations and deaths have dropped, businesses are reopening, and life is beginning to return to something approaching normalcy in several states. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits tumbled last week to 576,000, a post-COVID-19 low.

But progress has been patchy, and new hot spots — most notably Michigan — have flared up in recent weeks. Still, deaths in the U.S. are down to about 700 per day on average, plummeting from a mid-January peak of about 3,400.

In Europe, countries are feeling the brunt of a more contagious variant that first ravaged Britain and has pushed the continent’s COVID-19-related death toll beyond 1 million.

Close to 6,000 gravely ill patients are being treated in French critical care units, numbers not seen since the first wave a year ago.

Full Coverage: Coronavirus pandemic

Dr. Marc Leone, head of intensive care at the North Hospital in Marseille, said exhausted front-line staff members who were feted as heroes at the start of the pandemic now feel alone and are clinging to hope that renewed school closings and other restrictions will help curb the virus in the coming weeks.

“There’s exhaustion, more bad tempers. You have to tread carefully because there are a lot of conflicts,” he said. “We’ll give everything we have to get through these 15 days as best we can.”

Enlarge this image toggle caption Orvil Samuel/AP Orvil Samuel/AP

The volcano La Soufrière began to explosively erupt on the Caribbean island of St. Vincent last Friday. For nearly a week, periodic eruptions have covered the island in ash and volcanic flows of molten rock and gas have gushed down the mountainside. Residents have been displaced and are left without clean water or electricity, adding a humanitarian emergency into the mix.

La Soufrière's eruption forced approximately 30 villages on the northern portion of the island to evacuate. A report by the World Health Organization and The Pan American Health Organization said 16,000 to 20,000 people are affected. More than 4,000 people are occupying 89 public shelters. Two thousand others confirmed they are staying with friends or family.

Despite mandatory evacuation orders by Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves early last week, 127 people were rescued from Owia, a town on the northeastern side of the island and well within the volcano's danger zone.

The United States has been working to get Americans off the island. In collaboration with Royal Caribbean Cruises, the U.S. Embassy will transport American citizens from St. Vincent to Dutch Sint Maarten Friday free of charge.

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported Monday that the volcano's eruption has left the entire population of St. Vincent, 110,000 people, without clean drinking water or electricity. Access to St. Vincent and the Grenadines has been restricted since the eruption began. Airports are shut down and maritime travel is limited, hindering support efforts.

The biggest issue is clean water, U.N. Resident Coordinator for Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean Didier Trebucq said in a briefing Wednesday. The water system has been shut down so any drinking water is coming from outside the country. ""We are facing a situation with a great deal of uncertainty and also a humanitarian crisis that is growing and may continue for weeks and months,"" he said.

The U.N. said it has pre-positioned water and hygiene supplies, in nearby Barbados, including 60,000 masks and medical gowns. Additionally, PAHO will purchase 50 water tanks and pumps, chlorine testing kits and other necessities for health clinics.

The dome of the volcano has been completely destroyed during the periodic eruptions. More than 460 million cubic tons of rock and earth has been propelled into the atmosphere. Winds have carried the ash to neighboring islands of Barbados, Grenada and Saint Lucia.

Experts predict La Soufrière will continue to erupt. The University of the West Indies Seismic Research Centre said explosions and ashfall are expected to continue over the next few days. The volcano is showing a pattern of episodic explosions with long pauses. The UWI expects more explosions of similar or larger magnitude.

Pyroclastic flows continue to threaten the areas immediately surrounding the volcano. These flows of super-heated gas, rock and debris shoot down the face of the mountain, destroying everything in their path. They also move at incredible speeds, averaging 60 mph, but capable of reaching speeds of over 400 mph. These flows appear to have traveled along valleys on the Eastern side of the island toward the Rabacca River. However, these pyroclastic currents can take place anywhere in the immediate area of the volcano.

Trebucq said the crisis on St. Vincent will not be short lived. Even when the volcano stops erupting, which could be weeks from now, he expects the challenges to last more than six months.

0,U.S. has been wracked with several mass shootings in 2021,https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/u-s-has-been-wracked-with-several-mass-shootings-in-2021-1.5389930,"After a significant drop in mass shootings in the United States during a pandemic-hit 2020, this year has already seen several deadly cases.

Police in Indianapolis say eight people were shot and killed in a shooting late Thursday at a FedEx facility. The shooter also killed himself.

It follows a lull in mass killings during the pandemic in 2020, which had the smallest number of such attacks in more than a decade, according to a database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University. That database tracks mass killings defined as four or more dead, not including the shooter.

President Joe Biden last week announced a half-dozen executive actions to combat what he called an ""epidemic and an international embarrassment"" of gun violence in America. But he said much more is needed.

Here are a few recent mass shootings.

ATLANTA

Eight people were killed by a gunman at three Atlanta-area massage businesses in attacks that began the evening of March 16. Seven of the slain were women, and six were of Asian descent. Police charged a 21-year-old white man with the killings. There was deep skepticism over the shooter's claim his motive was sex addiction. There was public clamouring for hate crime charges, especially among the Asian American community, which has faced rising numbers of attacks since the coronavirus pandemic took hold.

BOULDER, COLORADO

About a week later, on March 22, a shooter at a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado, killed 10 people, including a police officer who was the first to respond to the scene. The suspect bought a firearm at a local gun store after passing a background check. Investigators are working to determine the motive for the shooting and why the suspect chose the King Soopers grocery store.

ORANGE, CALIFORNIA

On March 31, a gunman killed four people and critically wounded a fifth at a Southern California office building. He knew all the victims. Apparently before opening fire, he chained shut the gates to two entrances, delaying police from getting inside. Among the victims was a 9-year-old boy who was found cradled in the arms of a woman believed to be his mother. The woman was the only survivor among those shot. The others killed were a man and two women.

ROCK HILL, SOUTH CAROLINA

A week later, on April 7, former NFL player Phillip Adams shot six people. Robert Lesslie, a prominent doctor, was killed along with his wife, two of their grandchildren and two air conditioning technicians who were working at their home. Adams also killed himself. His brain is now being examined for possible degenerative disease that has been shown to cause violent mood swings and other cognitive disorders in some athletes and members of the military.",457,2758,10,57
0,Saudi university catches fire near Yemen border in attack,https://apnews.com/article/yemen-saudi-arabia-895b00bdd38af091b9c3609a8ff45596,"JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — A Saudi university near the country’s border with Yemen caught fire early Thursday after the kingdom’s air defenses intercepted a barrage of ballistic missiles and bomb-laden drones.

The interception scattered debris on Jizan University’s campus, which caused a fire that has been contained, the Saudi-led coalition at war in Yemen said in a statement. It said no one was killed, and there were no immediate reports of injuries.

Video on social media purportedly showed a Patriot missile flying low across Jizan to intercept a missile or drone, with it detonating over the city.

The barrage came just hours after Saudi Arabia warned Iran its recent decision to push its nuclear enrichment to its highest level ever risked raising tensions in the Mideast.

The Saudi statement blamed the Iran-backed Houthi group for the attack, saying the five ballistic missiles and four bomb-laden drones specifically targeted civilian areas and had been launched from the rebels’ stronghold of Saada in Yemen.

Houthi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yehia Sarie tweeted Thursday that his group had launched 11 missiles and drones at Saudi Arabia, targeting the kingdom’s Patriot defense system, oil sites and other “critical” areas in Jizan. Sarie did not mention the university.

The conflict in Yemen was sparked by the Houthis takeover of the capital, Sanaa, in 2014, which forced the internationally recognized government to flee the city. A Saudi-led coalition, which until recently was supported by the U.S., has been fighting the Houthis nearly ever since.

The U.N. humanitarian office says the war has caused an estimated 233,000 deaths, including 131,000 from indirect causes such as lack of food, health services and infrastructure. The conflict came on the heels of years of unrest and protests in Yemen against endemic corruption and government mismanagement.

Political deadlock and conflict in Yemen have created the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Aid groups report more than 20 million people in the impoverished Arab nation are experiencing food insecurity and half of them are at risk of famine.

Rights groups have criticized all sides in the conflict, but note that Saudi-led airstrikes have often been disproportionate and killed thousands of civilians.

Since the war began, the Houthis have launched over 550 bomb-laden drones and more than 350 ballistic missiles toward Saudi Arabia, the kingdom told The Associated Press in April .

On Wednesday, the U.S. State Department issued a warning to Americans to reconsider travel to the kingdom over the missile and drone attacks, as well as the coronavirus pandemic.

“Missile and drone attacks perpetrated by Iran and Iran-supported militant groups represent a significant threat,” the warning said. “U.S. citizens living and working near military bases and critical civilian infrastructure, particularly near the border with Yemen, are at heightened risk of missile, drone and rocket attacks.",465,3013,9,57
0,UN: 40 civilian casualties in central Yemen in March alone,https://www.thestar.com/news/world/middleeast/2021/04/16/un-40-civilian-casualties-in-central-yemen-in-march-alone.html,"CAIRO - The ongoing battle between Yemen’s Houthi rebels and government forces in the central province of Marib has caused 40 civilian casualties in March alone, the U.N. refugee agency said Friday.

At least 70 incidents of armed violence including shelling, crossfire, and air strikes have caused injuries and deaths among civilians during the first quarter of 2021, said the UNHCR in a statement. The UNHCR did not provide the breakdown of the killed and wounded but said that the tally was the highest in the oil-rich province since 2018.

Since February, Iran-backed Houthi rebels have been pushing to capture the province from the internationally recognized government to try to complete their control over the northern half of Yemen. If they succeed, the Houthis could claim a strategic win after a largely stalemated battle in almost seven years of fighting.

Among the civilian casualties were 13 people residing in makeshift settlements for displaced families, added the UNHCR.

The escalation in violence has so far displaced over 13,600 Yemenis in Marib, which already hosts a nearly one million of Yemen’s internally displaced people, said the statement. Almost 80 per cent of the newly-displaced are women and children who live in extreme poverty, said the UNHCR.

“UNHCR is renewing its call on all parties to the conflict to take measures to protect civilians, as well as civilian infrastructure, including sites hosting the displaced,” read the statement.

The UNHCR pleaded for urgent support from the international community to alleviate “the desperate situation” of the displaced Yemenis, deploring the decline in funding allocated to humanitarian efforts in the Arab world’s poorest country.

Yemen has been convulsed by civil war since 2014 when the Houthis took control of the capital of Sanaa and much of the northern part of the country, forcing the government of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi to flee to the south, then to Saudi Arabia.

The Saudi-led coalition, backed at the time by the U.S., entered the war months later to try restore Hadi to power. Despite a relentless air campaign and ground fighting, the war has deteriorated into a stalemate, killing about 130,000 people and spawning the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. The Biden administration last month officially withdrew its backing for the coalition but said the U.S. would continue to offer support to Saudi Arabia as it defends itself against Houthi attacks.

The Saudis have recently offered a ceasefire deal, but Houthis turned them down.

Police in the Southeast Asian nation said late Thursday that text messages were sent to 20 million Americans, pointing them to more than a dozen fake US government websites.

“Some 30,000 US citizens were scammed and the government’s financial loss is up to $60 million,” said East Java police chief Nico Afinta.

0,Russia expels US diplomats in retaliation for US sanctions,https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/304509,"Russia on Friday announced it would expel 10 US diplomats and take other retaliatory moves in response to sanctions imposed on Russia by US President Joe Biden a day earlier, The Associated Press reports.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also said Moscow will add eight US officials to its sanctions list and move to restrict and stop the activities of US nongovernment organizations from interfering in Russia’s politics.

He said the Kremlin suggested that US Ambassador John Sullivan follow the example of his Russian counterpart and head home for consultations.

The moves follow the sanctions on Russia announced this week by the Biden administration.

Lavrov noted that while Russia could take “painful measures” against American business interests in Russia, it wouldn’t immediately move to do that

The US on Thursday ordered 10 Russian diplomats expelled, targeted dozens of companies and people, and imposed new curbs on Russia’s ability to borrow money.

Biden later said that he is “prepared to take further actions” if Russia continues to interfere in US democracy.

“I was clear with President Putin that we could have gone further, but I chose not to do so, I chose to be proportionate,” Biden said of the measures, adding that he did not want to “kick off a cycle of escalation and conflict with Russia.”

The US intelligence community said in a landmark report last month that the Russian government meddled in the 2020 election with an influence campaign ""denigrating"" President Joe Biden and ""supporting"" former President Donald Trump.

In mid-December it was reported that a group of hackers backed by a “foreign government” stole information from the US Treasury Department and the Commerce Department’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).

Subsequently it was revealed that the attack also targeted the US Department of Homeland Security.

US intelligence later said that Russia was likely behind those hacking attacks.

Russia has long brushed off allegations of meddling in US elections, human rights abuses, cyberattacks as well as reports of placing bounties on US troops serving in Afghanistan.

Moscow described Biden’s moves on Thursday as a blow to bilateral relations and vowed to impose swift retaliatory measures.

The Kremlin also blamed the United States for weakening the diplomatic relations between Washington and Moscow.

0,Facebook and fear in Manila: Maria Ressa’s fight for facts,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/18/facebook-and-fear-in-manila-maria-ressas-fight-for-facts,"As terrible as the events were that played out on Capitol Hill on 6 January, Maria Ressa admits to feeling “a small amount of relief” about them. An ex-CNN bureau chief, and now the founder of her own news organisation, Rappler, she had spent the past two years sounding a warning about what she’d seen happen in her native country, the Philippines.

There, a Facebook-fuelled tsunami of lies had assisted an authoritarian into power. And she had seen where that had led: to opponents of the state being killed in their homes or turning up dead in ditches. As a Filipino American with a foot in both countries – she calls herself “the first of the CNN hybrids” – she was perfectly positioned to warn America about what happens when a populist president is allowed to spread out-of-control lies across a vast, unregulated tech platform. “A lie told a million times becomes a fact,” she repeated again and again.

So how did it feel to watch the lies become an actual insurrection? “I mean, it was Silicon Valley’s sins coming home to roost.” But it also meant that there now might finally be action. “I know this working for CNN for as long as I did, right? Until it’s picked up in the west, it doesn’t get attention. At least now everyone’s motivated to fight.”

Ressa has had no choice: she has had to fight. Because she’s not observing the tech dystopia from afar: she’s living it. When President Rodrigo Duterte came to power in 2016, he declared journalists criminals – a message that was taken at face value when Ressa found herself under sustained assault. First on Facebook, then in the courts when she was accused of tax evasion in 2017, and then, in 2019, “cyberlibel” – a criminal offence that carries a penalty of up to six years in jail.

When I last saw Ressa, on a fleeting visit to London in February last year, she was having to decide whether to return to Manila or not. She’d come to see her lawyers. She has a team in Manila but she is now also represented by two high-profile human rights barristers in Britain, Amal Clooney and Caoilfhionn Gallagher. This is because while the case is being heard in the Philippines, Ressa has come to represent the increasing assault on journalism everywhere.

On the evening we met, she was struggling to decide. She knew that if she returned home, she risked being trapped and tried in a country where journalism had become a crime and the rule of law has all but collapsed. We met for dinner and I told her not to go back. “I think I have to,” she said. “I just have to.” Ressa routinely brushes off the gravity of her situation but even she seemed worried. She returned and was detained days later. In June last year, she was found guilty – convicted on the basis of an article she didn’t write, published before Duterte’s cyberlibel offence came into existence. She is facing a sentence of between six months and six years, though she is now appealing against it in the supreme court.

You’d never know this from a casual encounter, though. She beams in via Zoom from her apartment in Manila, shooing her visiting niece away from her screen, and she is as smiley and upbeat and warm and solicitous and welcoming as ever. We’ve crossed paths a number of times and whenever I see her, in whatever circumstances, she always radiates the same positive energy. Even now, with nine criminal cases outstanding and 10 arrest warrants, she’s almost ridiculously upbeat.

However, the situation in the Philippines is still ominous. Duterte continues to flout the rule of law. When I ask Ressa how things are, she tells me about the recent “Bloody Sunday” in which seven activists were killed in their homes after police came knocking at 5.30 in the morning. Her legal appeal is being heard in what Amnesty calls “a climate of impunity” which has seen at least 61 lawyers killed.

It’s because of Facebook that Ressa and I came into contact. For two years, she was almost constantly on the road, because for her, telling the world about the dangers of Facebook has also been about survival. She knows her best chance of protection is the attention of the world. And it’s why on 23 April, English PEN is bringing her to speak at the Bristol Festival of Ideas.

Almost the first words Ressa said to me were: “We have to talk about Brexit.” Because the election that brought Duterte to power took place just weeks before the EU referendum and, she said, foreshadowed it in striking ways, not least in the troubling role that Facebook played.

My years on air with CNN taught me to step back and tamp down your emotions Maria Ressa

The Philippines was, she says, “the first of the dominoes to fall”: the first election of 2016 in which Facebook helped facilitate a corruption of the democratic process.

For years, Ressa hopped between big news organisations: from being the head of news at the biggest broadcaster in the Philippines to a bureau chief and investigative reporter for CNN. But in 2012, she set up her own online news outlet, Rappler, a young upstart that deployed all the tricks of social media to engage its audience.

And in the summer of 2016, it was her team who carefully studied data and traffic and began to notice a network of fake accounts in the news landscape. At first, they didn’t understand what they were seeing. And then they realised: it was a massive, online propaganda operation being run by the Philippines state, fake accounts spreading fake news about fake incidents. “I saw the data as we gathered it in and I was like, oh my God, it was like seeing the heart of darkness.”

Her first thought was to tell the tech giant. “We had a good relationship with Facebook and so I showed it to them because we didn’t really understand it at first. But we realised that Facebook didn’t understand it either. And then by about September 2016, we realised that the people being attacked on Facebook were the ones who were questioning Duterte’s drug war. It was an information operation being run by the government.”

Bodies had begun to be found on the streets. A programme of systematic killings had started as part of Duterte’s war on drugs, which Ressa and her team realised was being mirrored online. Critics were being attacked on Facebook by coordinated, government-run accounts. There were zero degrees of separation between online violence and the real world. “And we still didn’t publish it. I went back to Facebook and there was radio silence. So eventually we published.”

What happened next was as predictable as it was devastating: it was Ressa who came under attack. She was swamped by an onslaught of online threats. “It was so intense. I just didn’t know what was happening.” When her younger staff started getting them too, she got security and counselling. “You have to. It screws with your head.” Her CNN training abruptly kicked in. “My heroes are Captain Kirk and Mr Spock and my years on air with CNN taught me to step back and tamp down your emotions so you can understand what’s going on. And then be ready with three bullet points.”

For Ressa, the answers lay in the data. It’s part of her process. She found swarms of government supporters flooding Facebook with #UnfollowRappler. And she could see the effect. How the fake accounts reduced their followers and throttled their traffic. She could quantify it.

Context is everything, but social media is breaking down context Maria Ressa

For almost a year, Ressa tried to lobby Facebook to action behind the scenes. In spring 2017, she was invited to lunch with Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook’s annual developers’ conference in San Jose. She explained to him how powerful his platform was in her country. Facebook’s “Free Basics” – the programme that allows mobile phone users to access Facebook (and the internet) for free – means that for many Filipinos, Facebook is the internet: 97% of Filipinos, she told Zuckerberg, are on it. “‘What happened to the other 3%?’ he said. And he was serious! He wasn’t joking!”

Eventually, she gave up asking nicely and started to speak out publicly. “Do you blame Facebook for what’s happened?” I texted her in February last year. “I do,” she texted back. “It’s the same messages that were seeded on Facebook in 2016, #ArrestMariaRessa – Maria is not a journalist, she’s a criminal … a lie told a million times becomes a fact.”

The seriousness of her situation has forced Ressa to action. In the time I’ve known her, the language she uses to describe herself has changed. She is still a journalist but she now also considers herself an activist, traditionally a dirty word in US journalism, which is dominated by the idea of “objectivity”.

“You know the phrase I always use is that when it’s a battle for facts, journalism is activism. But actually I went back over history, and journalism has always been activism. Our goal is to hold power to account. That’s always been part of the mission.

“And when I was at CNN, I would always say that objectivity is a myth. Because it depends on who you are. I replaced a guy who was six foot two, and he was white, Anglo-Saxon, protestant, male. So that’s very different. I’m a five foot two Filipino American.

“The line between journalism and activism, to me, shifted on 13 February, when I was arrested. They wanted me to feel their power. They wanted me to be afraid, whatever. Right? But I was just so angry.”

The first time she came out and called herself the a-word was at a journalism conference in the US.

“And you could hear a pin drop. Because these are my peers. These are people running news organisations. But this is how it has to be now. We have to call a spade a spade. Context is everything, but social media is breaking down context. And we have to bring meaning. That is our job.”

Ressa has always belonged in two worlds. Her father died when she was one and her mother left her in the Philippines while she went to the US and settled down with a new husband, before coming back for the kids. Aged 10, Ressa was air-dropped into a New Jersey suburb, barely speaking English. “I was the shortest and only brown kid in my class, four foot two surrounded by giants.” She was the outsider. And then the overachiever. She went to Princeton and then back to the Philippines on a Fulbright scholarship. She has always understood both worlds but not quite belonged to either, a role she has used to advantage in her journalism.

What I hadn’t realised until now is how Ressa’s experience of the internet has come full circle. It was as an investigative reporter for CNN that she began digging into al-Qaida’s use of social media, an assignment that gave her the idea for Rappler. “I was looking at how this virulent ideology spread, I could see how networks can be used for evil. But then I began to realise that we can actually use information cascades as journalists for good.”

For a time, she says, she “drank the Kool-Aid”. She believed social media could connect the world in the ways Zuckerberg said it would. And she still thinks it didn’t have to turn out this way. “I think they got too greedy. They’ve completely screwed the information ecosystem.”

What comes next is anyone’s guess. Ressa’s legal troubles grind on. And the world has woken up to the dangers of social media but it hasn’t yet come up with a plan to fix it. As for Facebook, Ressa despairs. “They’re never going to be able to fix it if they can’t even acknowledge it’s broken.”

Israel will lift the requirement to wear masks outdoors starting on Sunday, Health Minister Yuli Edelstein announced on Thursday. The requirement will remain for indoor spaces.“The masks are intended to protect us from the coronavirus,” said Edelstein. “After our health professionals came to the conclusion that they are no longer needed outdoors, I decided to allow it according to their recommendation. The level of morbidity in Israel is very low thanks to our successful vaccination campaign, and thus we can ease up further restrictions for you, citizens of Israel. I ask you to still carry a mask in order to enter closed buildings. Together we will keep the morbidity low .”The move had been under discussion for several weeks, but authorities decided to wait until the end of Remembrance Day and Independence Day, fearing that mask-less celebrations might lead to a spike in cases.The majority of experts agree that the risk of contracting the coronavirus outdoors is very limited.“We know that wearing masks outdoors is not as effective as doing it indoors,” Dr. Eyal Leshem, the director of the Center for Travel Medicine and Tropical Diseases at Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, said last week. “Moreover, we see that many people don’t actually wear masks anymore anyway. Therefore at this point, with a low number of cases and a majority of the population vaccinated or recovered, it would make sense from epidemiological and public health perspectives to lift the requirement.”Also on Sunday, the education system will resume functioning in full after a year, with all children returning to study in their classrooms without capsules.",277,1947,10,58

SANTIAGO, Chile -- A real-world study of millions of Chileans who had received the Chinese-developed CoronaVac vaccine has found it 67% effective against symptoms and 80% against death from COVID-19, the South American country's Health Ministry said Friday.

Ministry adviser Rafael Araos said the study covered 10.5 million people, including 2.5 million who had received both doses of the vaccine and 1.5 million who had received a single dose between Feb. 2 and April 1.

It counted cases starting 14 days after application of the second dose of the vaccine, which in Chile was given 28 days after the first.

The vaccine has been widely used across the world, though not in the United States or Europe.

Araos said it had reduced hospitalizations by 85%, intensive care visits by 89% and deaths by 80%.

It is one of the broadest studies so far published of any of the vaccines used against the new coronavirus. Most previous studies were based on clinical studies of limited groups of thousands of people given the vaccines to test efficacy and safety prior to general use.

Chile has led the region with a vaccination campaign that has reached 40% of its 19 million people overall — and 27% of those have so far received both doses. It began in large part among the elderly and health workers, but has expanded to include essential workers and recently people as young as 48.

It has contracted for 60 million doses of the CoronaVac vaccine produced by Sinovac over three years, and also has been using vaccines produced by Pfizer. About 90% of vaccines used so far in Chile have been CoronaVac.

Authorities reported Thursday that Chile had been a sharp reduction in hospitalization of people 70 or older, something credited to the vaccination campaign among the elderly. But it has also seen “a sustained rise” in hospitalizations of people 59 and younger.

The country has reported 1.1 million confirmed infections of the new virus and nearly 25,000 deaths.",357,2136,9,58
0,"US expels Russian diplomats, imposes sanctions for hacking",https://apnews.com/article/us-expel-russia-diplomats-sanctions-6a8a54c7932ee8cbe51b0ce505121995,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration announced Thursday the U.S. is expelling 10 Russian diplomats and imposing sanctions against several dozen people and companies, holding the Kremlin accountable for interference in last year’s presidential election and the hacking of federal agencies.

The sweeping measures are meant to punish Russia for actions that U.S. officials say cut to the core of American democracy and to deter future acts by imposing economic costs on Moscow, including by targeting its ability to borrow money. The sanctions are certain to exacerbate tensions with Russia, which promised a response, even as President Joe Biden said the administration could have taken even more punitive measures but chose not to in the interests of maintaining stability.

“We cannot allow a foreign power to interfere in our democratic process with impunity,” Biden said at the White House.

Sanctions against six Russian companies that support the country’s cyber efforts represent the first retaliatory measures against the Kremlin for the hack familiarly known as the SolarWinds breach, with the U.S. explicitly linking the intrusion to the SVR, a Russian intelligence agency. Though such intelligence-gathering missions are not uncommon, officials said they were determined to respond because of the operation’s broad scope and the high cost of the intrusion on private companies.

The U.S. also announced sanctions on 32 individuals and entities accused of attempting to influence last year’s presidential election, including by spreading disinformation. U.S. officials alleged in a declassified report last month that Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized influence operations to help Donald Trump in his unsuccessful bid for reelection as president, though there’s no evidence Russia or anyone else changed votes or manipulated the outcome.

The actions, foreshadowed by the administration for weeks, signal a harder line against Putin, whom Trump was reluctant to criticize even as his administration pursued sanctions against Moscow. They are the administration’s second major foreign policy move in two days, following the announcement of troop withdrawals from Afghanistan. Until now, Biden has largely focused on the coronavirus pandemic and economy in his first months in office.

Biden said that when he advised Putin days earlier of the forthcoming measures — which included expulsion of the 10 diplomats, some of them representatives of Russian intelligence services — he told the Russian leader “that we could have gone further but I chose not to do so. I chose to be proportionate.”

ADVERTISEMENT

“We want,” he said, “a stable, predictable relationship.”

Even so, Russian officials spoke of a swift response, with Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov warning that “a series of retaliatory measures will come in the nearest time.”

Other American measures are expected, though the administration is not likely to announce them. Officials have advised that their response to Russia would be in ways both seen and unseen.

The sanctions are the latest in a series of actions that successive presidential administrations have taken to counter Russian behavior seen as antagonistic. It is unclear whether the new U.S. actions will result in changed behavior, especially since past measures — both Trump and Barack Obama expelled individual diplomats during their presidencies — have failed to bring an end to Russian hacking.

But experts suggest this latest round, even while not guaranteed to curb cyberattacks, might have more resonance because of its financial impact: The order makes it more difficult for Russia to borrow money by barring U.S. banks from buying Russian bonds directly from the Russian Central Bank, Russian National Wealth Fund and Finance Ministry. It could complicate Russian efforts to raise capital and give companies pause about doing business in Russia.

The impact of the sanctions and the U.S. willingness to impose costs will be weighed by Putin, though he is unlikely to make “a 180” degree pivot in his behavior, said Daniel Fried, a former assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs.

“The issue is, how can we push back against Putin’s aggression, while at the same time keeping open channels of communication and continuing to cooperate with Russia in areas of mutual interest,” Fried said. “And it seems to me the Biden administration has done a pretty good job framing up the relationship in exactly this way.”

Eric Lorber, a former Treasury Department official now with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the administration, is “surely trying to balance putting pressure on Russia, pushing back on Russia, while at the same time, not engaging in full-fledged economic warfare.”

The White House did not impose sanctions related to separate reports that Russia encouraged the Taliban to attack U.S. and allied troops in Afghanistan, saying instead that Biden was using diplomatic, military and intelligence channels to respond.

Reports of alleged “bounties” surfaced last year, with the Trump administration drawing criticism for not raising the issue directly with Russia. Administration officials said Thursday they had only low to moderate confidence in that intelligence, in part because of the ways in which the information was obtained, including from interrogations of Afghan detainees.

Among the companies sanctioned are websites U.S. officials say operate as fronts for Russian intelligence agencies and spread disinformation, including articles alleging widespread voter fraud in 2020. The individuals who were targeted include Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian and Ukrainian political consultant who worked with former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and who was indicted in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.

The Treasury Department said Thursday that Kilimnik had provided “sensitive information on polling and campaign strategy” to Russian intelligence services. That went further than Mueller’s office, which said in 2019 that it had been unable to determine what Kilimnik had done with the polling data after getting it from the Trump campaign.

Also sanctioned were the Kremlin’s first deputy chief of staff, Alexei Gromov, several individuals linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman with close ties to Russia’s president, nicknamed “Putin’s chef” for serving Kremlin functions, and several front companies the U.S. says helped Prigozhin evade sanctions imposed earlier.

The U.S. also sanctioned eight individuals and entities tied to Russia’s occupation in Crimea.

Biden informed Putin that the sanctions were coming earlier this week. Administration officials have made clear in their contacts with the Russia side that they are hoping to avoid a “downward spiral” in the relationship, according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity following the sanctions announcement.

The two leaders had a tense call in which Biden told Putin to “de-escalate tensions” following a Russian military buildup on Ukraine’s border, and said the U.S. would “act firmly in defense of its national interests” regarding Russian intrusions and election interference.

In a television interview last month, Biden replied “I do” when asked if he thought Putin was a “killer.” He said the days of the U.S. “rolling over” to Putin were done. Putin later recalled his ambassador to the U.S. and pointed at the U.S. history of slavery and slaughtering Native Americans and the atomic bombing of Japan in World War II.

Matteo Salvini, leader of Italy's right-wing League party, must stand trial on charges of kidnapping over his decision to prevent more than 100 migrants from landing in the country in 2019, a judge ordered on Saturday.

Salvini, who was interior minister at that time, left the migrants stranded at sea until prosecutors ordered the seizure of the ship and the evacuation of the people on board.

The trial will begin in the Sicilian capital of Palermo on September 15.

Salvini, who has built much of his political fortune on an anti-immigration campaign, could face up to 15 years in prison if found guilty at the end of a tortuous, three-stage judicial process.

A definitive conviction could bar him from government office.

""I am going to trial with my head held high, in your name as well as mine. Italy first, always,"" Salvini tweeted immediately after the ruling. ""Defending our country is a citizen's sacred duty ... that is what I am being tried for.""

During his 14 months as interior minister, Salvini stopped several boats from docking in Italy in an effort to halt migrant flows, and regularly accused the charities that operated them of effectively encouraging people smuggling.

Proactiva Open Arms, the Spanish NGO which operated the migrant rescue ship at the heart of the case, welcomed the judge's ruling.

""Violating a fundamental right such as the protection of human beings at sea for the sake of political propaganda is shameful,"" said its founder Oscar Camps, adding that the trial would be ""an opportunity to judge a period of European history.""

Salvini withdrew the League from the coalition government in the summer of 2019 in a failed bid to trigger an election when his party was riding high in the polls.

The League, now part of Mario Draghi's two-month-old national unity government, has lost more than 10 points of voter support but remains the most popular party in Italy on about 23%, according to most opinion polls.

0,Raul Castro to step down as head of Cuba’s Communist party,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/4/16/raul-castro-to-step-down-as-head-of-cubas-comminist-party,"Move marks a changing of the guard and the first time in 62 years that Cuba will not have a leader that is named Castro.

Havana, Cuba – By Monday, Cuba looks set to be without a Castro at the helm for the first time since Raúl and his brother Fidel swept down from the Sierra Maestra mountains in 1959, forcing the dictator Fulgencio Batista into exile.

One of the last surviving members of that “historic generation”, Raúl has said he will relinquish his post as the supremely powerful first secretary during the 8th Congress of the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC), which begins in Havana Friday.

The 89-year-old leaves a country queueing for food, wracked by the economic effects of coronavirus and US sanctions, and showing increasing signs of dissent.

A new song, Patria y Vida (Homeland and Life) plays off the old slogan Patria o Muerte (Homeland or Death) and can be heard in taxis and on the streets, the rap: “It’s over, it’s 62 [years] hurting.” Its message – enough is enough – infuriated the authorities enough that they responded with their own, using the original slogan. It wasn’t as popular.

And yet, Raúl leaves on his own terms, in the middle of a Congress that comes together under the banner “continuity and unity”. He leaves having initiated economic and political reforms that – until the catastrophe of coronavirus – had begun, at least according to local economists, to turn the rusting ship of state around.

Cuban President Raul Castro waves at a tribute to his brother and late former Cuban leader Fidel Castro (shown in image on wall) in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba, December 3, 2016 [File: Carlos Garcia Rawlins/Reuters] It’s widely believed he will be replaced by 60-year-old Miguel Díaz-Canel, who in 2018 succeeded him into the slightly lesser role of president.

“No one knows what is coming,” says the Cuban-born historian Ada Ferrer, author of the forthcoming Cuba: An American History. “No one knows what it will be like not to have this Castro family dynamic at the heart of Cuba after 60 years.”

Raúl Castro assumed power in 2008 as his brother Fidel’s health failed, first as president, and then in 2011 as first secretary of the communist party. Until then, he had led the army, his brother’s most loyal and trusted enforcer and advisor.

Surprisingly for a man who, in the words of Jorge Duany, director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University, “first moved to radicalise the Cuban revolution, perhaps even to influence Fidel to embrace Marxist Leninism”, he was reportedly far keener on market reforms than his brother.

As far back as the 1980s, according to defector Jesus Renzoli, Raúl’s secretary of 20 years, Raúl was pushing pro-market reforms in arguments with Fidel. Those beliefs came to fruition at the 6th party Congress in 2011, when 311 economic reforms were introduced, creating a new class of self-employed to fill the void as Raul began to shrink the state.

Raúl also said in 2011 it was time for a new generation to take the revolution forward, introducing a two-term limit for the leadership. A new constitution was drafted and voted through in 2019. At first it seemed liberalising – introducing equal marriage – before that measure was beaten back under pressure from a newly empowered church.

The inauguration of Donald Trump in 2017 undermined Raúl’s most significant achievement, a detente with the Obama administration that brought a flood of US visitors. Trump retightened the 60-year-old American sanctions, before COVID-19 finished the job, effectively ending any tourism to the island.

According to the Cuban state’s own figures, the economy shrank by 11 percent in 2020, while imports fell by 40 percent.

Cuba’s failing farms can’t feed its population of 11 million, so queues of six hours and more have formed to buy chicken, medicines and other essentials. After Cuba’s health system managed to all but keep the virus out in 2020, numbers are now rising as COVID gained a foothold over Christmas.

[Alexandre Meneghini/Reuters] It is into this crisis that Miguel Díaz-Canel will step, if confirmed as party head. “It seems to me his position is not an enviable one, given the problems he has inherited and the challenges that have fallen on his lap,” says Michael Bustamante, author of Cuban Memory Wars.

At first sight, Díaz-Canel appears underwhelming, a departure from the Castros. While much of the rest of the world has turned to populists, Cuba will be led by a nervous-looking electrical engineer in a guayabera, a traditional men’s shirt – the epitome of a bureaucrat.

Yet those who knew him in his previous roles as regional party chief, first in his home province of Villa Clara, then in Holguin in the east, say he was witty, engaging and quick to laugh. There has been little sign of that exuberance since.

“There has been so much emphasis on continuity, on his trying to telegraph clearly to the outside world that, you know, ‘I am not Mikhail Gorbachev’, that he has not projected much of his own vision,” says Bustamante, pointing out a vision of the future is exactly what a hurting country wants.

It remains to be seen whether new ideas emerge at the April 15-18 Congress. Certainly there will be much celebration of the country having created two vaccines of its own, Soberana 2 and Abdala, both now in late-stage trials. There will be praise of Cuba’s foreign medical brigades and the work they have been doing in the world’s poorer parts.

People queue to buy chicken in the Vedado neighbourhood of Havana, Cuba, April 16, 2021 [Ruaridh Nicoll/Al Jazeera] Rafael Hernández, the Havana-based editor of social science journal Temas, says he hopes for three main changes under a new party leader: extending private business beyond mom and pop restaurants and self-employed taxi drivers, giving Cuban state industries more autonomy, and a decentralisation of power to the provinces.

“It is particularly challenging because we are in the middle of an economic crisis, a pandemic, a political transition,” he says. “But that is no reason to slow down.” I mention this to a friend who laughs at the idea that it’s possible to go slower.

Raúl Castro has made it clear, he wishes to depart with others from the historic generation. He has said allowing the leadership to age has been a mistake.

As Raul heads to his retirement in the city of Santiago, it looks like his deputy, the 90-year-old second secretary José Ramón Machado, will also head to his. As to the other octogenarians and nonagenarians in the leadership structure, their political futures are unclear.

Of course, Raúl will not be judged just on the past 10 years but on the whole sweep of the revolution. Duany points out baleful aspects – that Raúl, along with Che Guevara, was widely credited with the “execution of political enemies” at the start. He also says Raúl can be credited with the “creation of the military and police state”.

As small but significant protests continue in both Havana and Santiago, the question is whether Díaz-Canel will resort further to state security to maintain the “continuity” he espouses. As for Raúl, he made his plans clear in 2018: “I will be just another soldier defending this revolution.”",1262,7500,11,58

European soccer's governing body UEFA has warned clubs linked to a breakaway Super League that they face being banned from domestic and international competitions if they set up a rival to the Champions League.

In a joint statement with Spanish, English and Italian leagues and federations, UEFA said it will consider ""all measures"", including the courts and bans from domestic leagues, in opposition to plans for a breakaway competition.

UEFA said it had learnt that clubs from those countries ""may be planning to announce their creation of a closed, so-called Super League"".

""If this were to happen, we wish to reiterate that we....(and) also FIFA and all our member associations - will remain united in our efforts to stop this cynical project, a project that is founded on the self-interest of a few clubs at a time when society needs solidarity more than ever,"" UEFA said.

""We will consider all measures available to us, at all levels, both judicial and sporting in order to prevent this happening. Football is based on open competitions and sporting merit; it cannot be any other way,"" the statement added.

In January, FIFA had said that a breakaway league would not be recognised and that ""any club or player involved in such a competition would as a consequence not be allowed to participate in any competition organised by FIFA or their respective confederation"" - meaning players would be banned from the World Cup.

Sunday's UEFA statement said: ""The clubs concerned will be banned from playing in any other competition at domestic, European or world level, and their players could be denied the opportunity to represent their national teams.

""We thank those clubs in other countries, especially the French and German clubs, who have refused to sign up to this. We call on all lovers of football, supporters and politicians, to join us in fighting against such a project if it were to be announced. This persistent self-interest of a few has been going on for too long. Enough is enough.""

0,Human cells grown in monkey embryos reignite ethics debate,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/apr/15/human-cells-grown-monkey-embryos-reignite-ethics-debate,"Monkey embryos containing human cells have been produced in a laboratory, a study has confirmed, spurring fresh debate into the ethics of such experiments.

The embryos are known as chimeras, organisms whose cells come from two or more “individuals”, and in this case, different species: a long-tailed macaque and a human.

In recent years researchers have produced pig embryos and sheep embryos that contain human cells – research they say is important as it could one day allow them to grow human organs inside other animals, increasing the number of organs available for transplant.

Now scientists have confirmed they have produced macaque embryos that contain human cells, revealing the cells could survive and even multiply.

In addition, the researchers, led by Prof Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte from the Salk Institute in the US, said the results offer new insight into communications pathways between cells of different species: work that could help them with their efforts to make chimeras with species that are less closely related to our own.

“These results may help to better understand early human development and primate evolution and develop effective strategies to improve human chimerism in evolutionarily distant species,” the authors wrote.

The study confirms rumours reported in the Spanish newspaper El País in 2019 that a team of researchers led by Belmonte had produced monkey-human chimeras. The word chimera comes from a beast in Greek mythology that was said to be part lion, part goat and part snake.

The study, published in the journal Cell, reveals how the scientists took specific human foetal cells called fibroblasts and reprogrammed them to become stem cells. These were then introduced into 132 embryos of long-tailed macaques, six days after fertilisation.

“Twenty-five human cells were injected and on average we observed around 4% of human cells in the monkey epiblast,” said Dr Jun Wu, a co-author of the research now at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.

The embryos were allowed to develop in petri dishes and were terminated 19 days after the stem cells were injected. In order to check whether the embryos contained human cells, the team engineered the human stem cells to produce a fluorescent protein.

Among other findings, the results reveal all 132 embryos contained human cells on day seven after fertilisation, although as they developed, the proportion containing human cells fell over time.

“We demonstrated that the human stem cells survived and generated additional cells, as would happen normally as primate embryos develop and form the layers of cells that eventually lead to all of an animal’s organs,” Belmonte said.

The team also reported that they found some differences in cell-cell interactions between human and monkey cells within chimeric embryos, compared with embryos of the monkeys without human cells.

Wu said they hoped the research would help develop “transplantable human tissues and organs in pigs to help overcome the shortages of donor organs worldwide”.

Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, a developmental biologist from the Francis Crick Institute in London, said at the time of the El País report he was not concerned about the ethics of the experiment, noting the team had only produced a ball of cells. But he noted conundrums could arise in the future should the embryos be allowed to develop further.

While not the first attempt at making human-monkey chimeras – another group reported such experiments last year – the new study has reignited such concerns. Prof Julian Savulescu, the director of the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics and co-director of the Wellcome Centre for Ethics and Humanities at the University of Oxford, said the research had opened a Pandora’s box to human-nonhuman chimeras.

“These embryos were destroyed at 20 days of development but it is only a matter of time before human-nonhuman chimeras are successfully developed, perhaps as a source of organs for humans,” he said, adding that a key ethical question is over the moral status of such creatures.

“Before any experiments are performed on live-born chimeras, or their organs extracted, it is essential that their mental capacities and lives are properly assessed. What looks like a nonhuman animal may mentally be close to a human,” he said. “We will need new ways to understand animals, their mental lives and relationships before they are used for human benefit.”

Others raised concerns about the quality of the study. Dr Alfonso Martinez Arias, an affiliated lecturer in the department of genetics at the University of Cambridge, said: “I do not think that the conclusions are backed up by solid data. The results, in so far as they can be interpreted, show that these chimeras do not work and that all experimental animals are very sick.

“Importantly, there are many systems based on human embryonic stem cells to study human development that are ethically acceptable and in the end, we shall use this rather than chimeras of the kind suggested here.”",810,5048,9,58
0,"Greek, Turkish foreign ministers clash at press conference",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/15/greek-turkish-ministers-clash-at-press-conference,"The Greek foreign minister used his opening remarks to rattle off a series of longstanding complaints about Turkey.

The foreign ministers of Greece and Turkey have exchanged accusations on a wide range of issues during a volatile press conference at the end of their first meeting in over a year.

The meeting between Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and his Greek counterpart Nikos Dendias was ostensibly designed to show the two uneasy NATO neighbours trying to put aside their differences after a year of complex disputes.

The two countries teetered on the edge of all-out war when their gunboats collided while shadowing each other during a Turkish push into disputed eastern Mediterranean waters last August.

The press conference opened with conciliatory remarks from Cavusoglu in which he praised “the very positive dialogue” they just held in the Turkish capital.

Cavusoglu said he believes the disputes with Greece can be resolved through constructive dialogue, and that faits accomplis and provocative rhetoric should be avoided in relations between the two countries.

“It is in our interests that minorities in both countries live in peace, it will have a positive impact on our relations,” he said.

“Greece’s position is clear and this is not the first time you have heard it,” Dendias told Cavusoglu during a particularly heated moment in the 35-minute press conference.

“If you heavily accuse my country and people before the press, I have to be in a position to respond to that,” Cavusoglu replied.

“If you want to continue our tensions, we can,” he added.

Dendias also expressed support for Turkey’s bid to join the European Union but said any violations of Greece’s sovereignty would be sanctioned.

His comments prompted an angry response from Cavusoglu who described them as “unacceptable”, prompting Dendias to say he was surprised Cavusoglu had expected him to act as if nothing had happened in the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean.

Tensions between neighbours

Dendias’s visit to Ankara is the first from a high-profile Greek minister in more than two years.

The continued threat of armed conflict between the two NATO allies has alarmed the European Union.

Tensions had flared last year as Turkish research ships explored for oil and gas reserves in waters claimed by Greece and its close ally Cyprus.

Other issues include competing claims over their respective continental shelves, maritime rights, air space in the Mediterranean, energy, the Cyprus issue and the status of some islands in the Aegean Sea.

Turkey has also accused the Greek coastguard of putting lives at risk by forcing migrants trying to reach the Greek islands back into Turkish waters. Meanwhile, Greece has claimed Turkey is facilitating such crossings in breach of a 2016 refugee deal between Ankara and the EU.",526,3305,8,58

PRAGUE (AP) — The Czech Republic announced Saturday that it was expelling 18 Russian diplomats who it has identified as spies in a case related to a huge ammunition depot explosion in 2014.

Prime Minister Andrej Babis said the move is based on “unequivocal evidence” provided by the Czech intelligence and security services that points to the involvement of Russian military agents in the massive explosion in an eastern town that killed “two innocent fathers.”

“The Czech Republic is a sovereign state and must adequately react to those unprecedented findings,” Babis said.

Interior Minister Jan Hamacek, who is also serving as the country’s foreign minister, said the 18 Russian embassy staffers were clearly identified as spies from the Russian intelligence services known as GRU and SVR and were ordered to leave the country within 48 hours.

The explosion, which took place on Oct. 16, 2014 in a depot in the town of Vrbetice where 50 metric tons of ammunition was stored, claimed two victims. Another explosion of 13 tons of ammunition occurred in the depot on Dec. 3 of that same year.

Hundreds had to be evacuated from nearby villages after those explosions.

“The United States stands with its steadfast ally, the Czech Republic,” Jennifer Bachus, chargé d’affaires at the U.S. embassy in Prague, said. “We appreciate their significant action to impose costs on Russia for its dangerous actions on Czech soil.”

The Czech announcement came two days after the U.S. said it was expelling 10 Russian diplomats and imposing sanctions against several dozen people and companies, holding the Kremlin accountable for interference in last year’s presidential election and the hacking of federal agencies.

Babis said President Milos Zeman, who is known for his pro-Russian views, has been informed about the development and has “expressed absolute support for us.”

He said the investigation into the case has not yet been completed but thanked the country’s security forces for their “professional job.”

The announcement sent a shockwave across the country, with the politicians from the government parties and opposition united in condemning the Russian move.

“It’s an act of state terrorism,” said Petr Fiala, the head of the opposition Civic Democratic Party.

Jiri Sedivy, former chief the Czech military’s general staff, said the Czechs have to response “resolutely” to the Russian action.

“”It was an obvious military attack on our sovereign territory,” Sedivy told the Czech public television.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said her country would answer the Czech move.

“Prague is well aware of what will follow such tricks,” Zakharova was quoted by the RIA Novosti news agency.

Hamacek said the the case will significantly harm Czech-Russian relations. He said the country’s allies in NATO and the European Union have been informed about the findings and “we’ve asked for their support.”

“We’re in a similar situation like Britain in the attempted poisoning case in Salisbury in 2018,” Hamacek said, without elaborating.

Britain expelled dozens of Russian diplomats after Russian agents used a Soviet-era nerve agent to poison a former Russian spy and his daughter who were living in the English city of Salisbury.

At the same time, the Czech police’s organized crime unit on Saturday published photos of two foreign citizens who visited the country, including the Zlin region where Vrbetice is located, between Oct. 11 and Oct. 16 in 2014 and asked the public for any information about them.

The two were using Russian passports and were identified as Alexander Petrov, 41, and Ruslan Boshirov, 43. Petrov and Boshirov were charged in absentia by Britain in 2018 for trying to kill former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, with the Soviet nerve agent Novichok.

The Czech police said the two men were also using passports issued by Moldova for Nicolai Popa and a passport issued by Tajikistan for Ruslan Tabarov.

They said the two also visited the capital of Prague and another northeastern Czech region.",823,5210,10,58
0,Surprise! Mask Wearing Substantially Lowers COVID-19 Rates,https://interestingengineering.com/mask-wearing-lowers-covid-19-rates,"Researchers found a statistical link between high adherence to mask-wearing and lower rates of COVID-19 throughout the United States, according to a study recently published in the journal PLOS ONE.

Mask-wearing is a major factor in lowering COVID-19 rates

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, different states in the U.S. executed disparate policies on mask-wearing, some of which didn't mandate masks at all, while others made them necessary in every public space. Studying the link between mask adherence and COVID-19 rates might help policymakers effectively mitigate stress on healthcare systems, assuage economic instability, and even prevent death.

Charlie Fischer and colleagues at the Boston University School of Public Health in Massachusetts wrote the recent study — which aims to clarify the effects of mask-wearing via analyzing publicly available data on policies related to mask-wearing. The data also included people's self-reported mask-wearing habits, in addition to COVID-19 rates throughout all 50 U.S. States and Washington, D.C.

States showing the lowest adherence rates saw the greatest likelihood of surging COVID-19 rates the following month — an unmistakable pattern. The eight states with at least 75% adherence to mask-wearing guidance saw an average COVID-19 rate of 109.26 per 100,000 residents the following month — but the average COVID-19 rate more than doubled for states with less than 75% adherence, to 239.99 per 100,000.

This latest analysis lends new evidence to the idea of mask-wearing as a major factor in reducing COVID-19 rates. This also means top-down policies and public health moves to lower the spread of COVID-19 infections should always center on improved mask-wearing adherence in every state.

mask-wearing is crucial amid COVID-19 variants

This comes on the heels of an earlier finding from the CDC — which said wearing an additional cloth mask over a surgical mask to form a second layer substantially increases the protective capacities for both wearers and bystanders. The study was first announced during a White House briefing on the coronavirus — where officials emphasized a need for people in the U.S. to wear ""a well-fitting mask"" with at least two layers, according to a report from the New York Times.

With the mounting threat of some coronavirus variants — especially in light of some vaccines' potential ineffectiveness — masks are the only tried-and-true way of lowering the risk of infection with certainty. ""With cases, hospitalizations and deaths still very high, now is not the time to roll back mask requirements,"" said Director CDC Rochelle P. Walensky, in the Times report. ""The bottom line is this: Masks work, and they work when they have a good fit and are worn correctly.""

We're in year two of a global pandemic, and it's unclear if or when the COVID-19 coronavirus will subside this year. Even with the vaccine rollout, it's important, as always, to keep vigilant in closed, public spaces — follow mask-wearing guidelines, and consider doubling-up on masks. Because even if you've received a vaccine, there's no guarantee you've immunity to an already existing or novel mutation of the virus.",500,3186,7,58

“Nothing, nothing, nothing is forcing me to make this decision,” said Castro, part of whose speech to the closed Congress was aired on state television. “As long as I live I will be ready with my foot in the stirrup to defend the homeland, the revolution and socialism with more force than ever.”

Castro didn’t say who he would endorse as his successor as first secretary of the Communist Party. But he previously indicated he favors yielding control to 60-year-old Miguel Díaz-Canel, who succeeded him as president in 2018 and is the standard bearer of a younger generation of loyalists who have been pushing an economic opening without touching Cuba’s one-party system.

Photographs released by the official Cuban News Agency showed Castro, dressed in an olive green uniform, entering the congress with Díaz-Canel by his side.

Castro’s retirement means that for the first time in more than six decades Cubans won’t have a Castro formally guiding their affairs, and it comes at a difficult time, with many on the island anxious about what lies ahead.

The coronavirus pandemic, painful financial reforms and restrictions imposed by the Trump administration have battered the economy, which shrank 11% last year as a result of a collapse in tourism and remittances. Long food lines and shortages have brought back echoes of the “special period” that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s.

Discontent has been fueled by the spread of the Internet and growing inequality.

Much of the debate inside Cuba is focused on the pace of reform, with many complaining that the so-called “historic generation” represented by Castro has been too slow to open the economy.

In January, Díaz-Canel finally pulled the trigger on a plan approved two congresses ago to unify the island’s dual currency system, giving rise to fears of inflation. He also threw the doors open to a broader range of private enterprise — a category long banned or tightly restricted — permitting Cubans to legally operate many sorts of self-run businesses from their homes.

This year’s congress is expected to focus on unfinished reforms to overhaul state-run enterprises, attract foreign investment and provide more legal protection to private business activities.

The Communist Party is made up of 700,000 activists and is tasked in Cuba’s constitution with directing the affairs of the nation and society.

Fidel Castro, who led the revolution that drove dictator Fulgencio Batista from power in 1959, formally became head of the party in 1965, about four years after officially embracing socialism.

He quickly absorbed the old party under his control and was the country’s unquestioned leader until falling ill in 2006 and in 2008 handing over the presidency to his younger brother Raul, who had fought alongside him during the revolution.

Raul succeeded him as head of the party in 2011. Fidel Castro died in 2016

For most of his life, Raul played second-string to his brother Fidel — first as a guerrilla commander, later as a senior figure in their socialist government. But for the past decade, it’s Raul who has been the face of communist Cuba and its defiance of US efforts to oust its socialist system.

The fourth of seven children of a Spanish immigrant in eastern Cuba, Raul had joined his charismatic older brother in a nearly suicidal attack on the Moncada military barracks in the eastern city of Santiago in 1953 and survived the crackdown that followed from the forces of dictator Fulgencio Batista.

He led a major front in the ensuing guerrilla war led by Fidel that toppled Batista. And he served for the following generation or two as head of the armed forces and eventually as Fidel’s designated successor. For many years, he was considered a more orthodox communist than his brother.

But it was Raul who reached accords with US President Barack Obama in 2014 that created the most extensive US opening to Cuba since the early 1960s — creating a surge in contacts with the United States that was largely reversed under Obama’s successor, Donald Trump.",751,4527,10,58
0,Three Iranians to go on trial in Denmark on terror charges,https://www.timesofisrael.com/three-iranians-to-go-on-trial-in-denmark-on-terror-charges/,"Three leaders of an Iranian Arab separatist group will go on trial in Denmark on April 29 accused of financing and promoting terrorism in Iran with Saudi Arabia’s backing, prosecutors said Thursday.

“Three leaders of the ASMLA (Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahvaz) are accused of financing and promoting terrorism in Iran in cooperation with a Saudi intelligence service,” the Danish prosecution service said in a statement.

The case is to be heard at the Roskilde court, near Copenhagen, and the Iranians risk 12 years in prison if found guilty.

The trio have been in custody since February 2020, but the case dates back to 2018 when one of them was the target of a planned attack on Danish soil believed to be sponsored by the Iranian regime in retaliation for the killing of 24 people in Ahvaz, southwestern Iran, in September 2018.

Tehran formally denied the attack plan in Denmark, but a Danish court last year jailed a Norwegian-Iranian for seven years for his role in the plot.

Meanwhile, the attack put Danish authorities on the trail of the trio’s ASMLA activities.

Police then arrested the three, suspecting them of collecting information on people and companies in Denmark and abroad, in cooperation with Saudi intelligence services.

Sunni Saudi Arabia is the Shia Islamic Republic’s main rival in the Middle East.

In addition to promoting and financing terrorism, the three men, whose identities have not been disclosed, are also accused of assisting Saudi intelligence on military issues, among other things.

Their alleged crimes took place between 2012 and 2020, prosecutors said.

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. humanitarian chief warned Thursday that the grave humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia’s embattled Tigray region is deteriorating, with no sign of Eritrean troops withdrawing and alarmingly widespread reports of systematic rape and other sexual violence mainly by men in uniform.

Mark Lowcock told a closed Security Council meeting that the U.N. knows that 4.5 million of Tigray’s nearly 6 million people need humanitarian aid and the government estimates 91% of the population needs emergency food.

He said his office received the first report earlier this week of four displaced people dying from hunger, and Thursday morning he received reports of 150 people in the Ofla district just south of Tigray’s capital Mekelle dying from hunger.

“This should alarm us all,” Lowcock said in his briefing, obtained by The Associated Press. “It is a sign of what lies ahead if more action is not taken. Starvation as a weapon of war is a violation.”

No one knows how many thousands of civilians or combatants have been killed since months of political tensions between Ethiopian President Abiy Ahmed’s government and the Tigray leaders who once dominated Ethiopia’s government exploded in November into war. Eritrea, a longtime Tigray enemy, teamed up with neighboring Ethiopia in the conflict.

Lowcock said humanitarian organizations had hoped things would improve after Abiy announced in late March that Eritrean troops would leave Tigray, but he said neither the U.N. nor the aid groups it works with have seen any proof of withdrawal.

“We have, however, heard some reports of Eritrean soldiers now wearing Ethiopian Defense Force uniforms,” he said. “And regardless of uniform or insignia, humanitarian staff continue to report new atrocities which they say are being committed by Eritrean Defense Forces.”

As an example, Lowcock cited an Amnesty International report that Eritrean troops killed three people and wounded 19 Monday “in an unprovoked, indiscriminate shooting attack on civilians in Adwa town.”

There are also reports of militias from neighboring Amhara attacking civilians in western Tigray and driving them from their home while Amhara authorities restrict access to those who fled, he said.

As for reports of sexual violence, Lowcock said one unnamed agency reported that 30% of all incidents against civilians involved some sort of sexual violence and nearly 25% of reports received by another involved gang rape, “with multiple men assaulting the victim,” sometimes repeatedly over a period of days, and with girls as young as 8 years old being targeted.

“Cases reported have involved Ethiopian National Defense Forces, Eritrean Defense Forces, Amhara Special Forces and other irregular armed groups or aligned militia,” he said.

Lowcock said he is left to conclude “that there is no doubt that sexual violence is being used in this conflict as a weapon of war, as a means to humiliate, terrorize and traumatize an entire population today and into the next generation.”

He said humanitarian needs are still growing because “since the conflict began, civilians have endured indiscriminate shelling of towns, targeted violence, mass killings and executions and systematic sexual violence as a weapon of war.”

“Improvements in access and a reduction in conflict and atrocities have often proved temporary and sporadic,” Lowcock said. “So they are getting hungrier and sicker.”

“To be very clear: The conflict is not over and things are not improving,” he said.

Without a cease-fire, Lowcock said, the humanitarian crisis “is only going to get a lot worse.”

Despite these difficulties, humanitarian organizations have reached more than 1.7 million people with some form of aid, but he said more funding is needed.

Lowcock said agencies have allocated about $280 million of what the U.N. thinks will be more than $400 million needed to respond to Tigray’s humanitarian crisis, and he thanked the United States for announcing about $300 million for the region.

0,"Saudi, Iranian officials held direct talks in Iraq: Report",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/18/saudi-iranian-officials-held-talks-to-patch-up-relations-report,"Media report says first round of talks held in Baghdad earlier this month with the Iraqi PM facilitating the process.

Senior Saudi and Iranian officials held direct talks in a bid to repair relations between the two regional rivals, according to a report in the Financial Times which quoted officials briefed on the discussions.

The first round of the reported talks, held four years after both sides cut off diplomatic ties, took place in Baghdad on April 9 and included discussions about attacks on Saudi Arabia by Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi group.

The unnamed official quoted in the report said the Saudi delegation was led by Khalid bin Ali al-Humaidan, the kingdom’s intelligence chief, and another round of talks was also scheduled.

There has been no comment from either side following the publishing of the report.

The FT also said that a senior Saudi official denied there had been any talks with Iran.

Lebanon’s pro-Iran Al Mayadeen television channel and Unews news agency on Sunday both cited an Iranian source denying talks with Saudi Arabia.

In recent weeks, Houthi fighters have stepped up missile and drone attacks, often targeting Saudi oil facilities and military points across the kingdom, saying they are in response to deadly Saudi air raids in Yemen.

Saudi Arabia accuses Iran of smuggling weapons to the Houthis, who have control the Yemeni capital Sanaa since 2015.

The news comes as US and Iran try to revive a 2015 nuclear deal which Saudi Arabia has opposed.

Riyadh has called for a nuclear deal with stronger parameters and said Gulf states should join any negotiations on the accord to ensure that this time it addresses Iran’s missiles programme and its support for regional proxies.

The US has also pressed for an end to the Yemen conflict, seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

The report added that Iraq’s Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi visited Saudi Arabia late last month and has been facilitating the “process”.

Citing an Iraqi official, FT reported that Baghdad also facilitated “communication channels” for Iran with Egypt and Jordan.

“The [Iraqi] prime minister is very keen to personally play a role in turning Iraq into a bridge between these antagonistic powers in the region,” the official said. “It’s in Iraq’s interest that it can play this role. The more confrontation you have in the region, the more they play out here… and these talks have been taking place.”

Iraq is also home to powerful Iranian-backed militia groups, as well as US troops, and has often been used as a battleground.

In January 2020, a US drone strike killed Iran’s revered general Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi militia commander, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, pushing Washington and Tehran to the brink of war.

Iran retaliated by targeting an Iraqi military airbase where US troops were stationed.

Another official briefed on the latest talks said Kadhimi has “good links into the Iranian system”, FT reported.

“The new thing is Kadhimi playing this role with Saudi Arabia… It’s a good thing Iraq is playing this role, but it’s very early days.”",514,3102,9,58
0,Chad army claims it has stopped rebel drive toward capital,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/chadian-military-advancing-rebel-column-decimated-77149694,"The Chadian military says it has stopped a rebel advance in the country's north but the rebels are vowing to press ahead

N'DJAMENA, Chad -- The Chadian military said it had halted an advance by rebels coming from neighboring Libya, but the rebel group said Sunday that it was pressing ahead after the American and British embassies warned of a possible assault on the capital in the coming days.

Army spokesman Azim Bermandoa Agouna said that clashes had taken place late Saturday in the northern province of Kanem and that the rebel column from Libya was “totally decimated.”

“Congratulations to our valiant defense and security forces,” government spokesman Cherif Mahamat Zene tweeted, describing the rebel forces as “mercenaries coming from Libya.”

It was not immediately possible to independently corroborate the claims given the remote location where the fighting took place. A warning issued to British citizens, though, said there were believed to be two rebel convoys — one moving from the town of Faya toward the capital, N'Djamena, and another seen headed toward the town of Mao.

The rebel group known as the Front for Change and Concord in Chad issued a statement Sunday on its Facebook page stating that its forces had begun “the liberation of Kanem region.""

“We assure all residents of the city of N'Djamena, including diplomatic staff, United Nations agents, organizations, partners, and expats working in Chad to stay calm and avoid unnecessary travel outside the city of N'Djamena,” said the statement issued by spokesman Kingabe Ogouzeimi de Tabul.

The rebels are believed to have crossed over into Chad a week ago on election day as President Idriss Deby sought to extend his three-decade-long grip on power. While the incumbent was all but certain to win another term, official results have not yet been released.

The U.S. State Department on Saturday ordered non-essential diplomats at the U.S. Embassy in Chad to leave along with the families of American personnel stationed there, saying armed groups appear to be moving on the capital.

“Due to their growing proximity to N’Djamena, and the possibility for violence in the city, non-essential U.S. government employees have been ordered to leave Chad by commercial airline,"" the department said in a travel alert.

The central African nation has had a long history of rebellions during the 30-year reign of Deby. In 2019, French armed forces intervened in northern Chad and launched airstrikes at an armed group coming in from Libya.

In 2008, clashes reached the gate of the presidential palace before Chad’s army repelled rebel forces and pursued them eastward toward the Sudanese border.

Chad, a former French colony, is home to France's military Operation Barkhane, which deploys troops across the continent to fight Islamic extremism. The Chadian military also has played a major role in that effort, contributing troops to the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Mali.

Chadian soldiers also have long battled militants from the extremist group Boko Haram which started in northeastern Nigeria and spread to neighboring countries. Some 330,000 Chadians are internally displaced, the majority in the volatile Lake Chad region where Boko Haram fighters are most active.

WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Elation marked the opening Monday of a long-anticipated travel bubble between Australia and New Zealand.

The start of quarantine-free travel was a relief for families who have been separated by the coronavirus pandemic as well as to struggling tourist operators. It marked the first, tentative steps toward what both countries hope will become a gradual reopening to the rest of the world.

The idea of a bubble between Australia and New Zealand had been talked about for months but faced setbacks because of several small virus outbreaks in both countries, which were eventually stamped out.

To mark the occasion, Wellington International Airport painted an enormous welcome sign near its main runway and Air New Zealand ordered some 24,000 bottles of sparkling wine, offering a complimentary glass to adult passengers.

Air New Zealand’s Chief Operating Officer Carrie Hurihanganui said the carrier had previously been running just two or three flights a day between the two countries but that jumped to 30 flights on Monday carrying 5,200 passengers.

She said the day marked a turning point and people were excited.

“You can feel it at the airport and see it on people’s faces,” she said.

The leaders of both countries welcomed the bubble, saying it was a world-leading arrangement because it aimed to both open borders and keep the virus from spreading.

“Today’s milestone is a win-win for Australians and New Zealanders, boosting our economies while keeping our people safe,” Australian Prime Scott Morrison said.

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said her country was welcoming new arrivals.

“The bubble marks a significant step in both countries’ reconnection with the world and it’s one we should all take a moment to be very proud of,” she said.

Travelers who lined up at Sydney and Melbourne airports early Monday said they were excited or relieved to finally fly to New Zealand after more than a year. Some were visiting family and friends, while others were attending funerals.

Both countries have managed to keep out the virus by putting up barriers to the outside world, including strict quarantine requirements for travelers returning from other countries where the virus is rampant.

Australia had previously allowed New Zealanders to arrive without going into quarantine but New Zealand had taken a more cautious approach, requiring travelers from Australia complete a quarantine.

The start of the bubble comes ahead of the New Zealand ski season and is welcome news for many tourist towns, including the ski resort of Queenstown.",485,3058,7,58
0,Iran rejects claim Ukraine’s plane shot down intentionally,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/17/iran-rejects-claim-ukraines-plane-was-shot-down-intentionally,"Ukraine is trying to gain political points by making assertions over its downed plane in Tehran, Iran says.

Tehran, Iran – Iran’s foreign ministry has “strongly rejected” the Ukrainian security chief’s assertion that the shooting down of a passenger plane last year was intentional, accusing him of politicising the issue.

Foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said on Saturday it is unfortunate that Ukrainian officials continue to publicly air “personal and bespoke hypotheses” despite technical reports offered by Iran.

He said it appears Ukraine is not after resolving the case of Flight PS752, whose downing killed all 176 people on board, and wishes to make political gains by “linking this painful accident with its local issues or foreign affairs with other countries”.

The comments come after Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, said the incident was a “conscious attack” that may have been aimed at preventing the United States from attacking Iran.

The Ukraine International Airlines flight was shot down with two missiles fired from an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp air defence system in early January 2020, hours after Iran fired missiles at two US bases in neighbouring Iraq.

The attack on US interests was in response to the assassination of Qassem Soleimani, Iran’s top general, in a drone strike ordered days earlier by then-President Donald Trump.

Iran’s final technical report on the downing of the plane said last month “human error” was responsible as a surface-to-air missile defence system near the Imam Khomeini International Airport had not been recalibrated after being moved shortly before the incident, so it mistook the plane for a “hostile object”.

Even as all flights to Iraq and those scheduled to fly over the western parts of the country had been cancelled, the report said, the risk of misidentification of commercial flights, and flights from the Tehran airport was deemed to be low.

Ukraine at the time called the report a “cynical attempt to hide the true reasons for the downing of our plane”.

Tehran ready for talks

The Iranian foreign ministry spokesman also said in his statement Iran is ready to hold more talks with all aggrieved sides within the framework of international law and called on them to refrain from “exiting the framework of logic and law” in their remarks.

A spokesman of Iran’s National Security Council also rejected Danilov’s claim, saying he met Iran’s security chief Ali Shamkhani shortly after the incident and was presented with “comprehensive technical explanations”.

Keyvan Khosravi said several investigations conducted by Iranian authorities have since “decisively refuted any other possibilities or theories” except the accidental shooting down of the plane.

Iran’s government in January set a compensation of $150,000 for each victim’s family.

Earlier this month, a military prosecutor said 10 unnamed officials who were involved in the incident have been indicted and will head to court soon.",474,3032,8,58
0,"In a Russia-NATO War, Missiles Would Destory All of Europe",https://nationalinterest.org/blog/reboot/russia-nato-war-missiles-would-destory-all-europe-183030,"In the event of a military conflict over the Baltic States, Russian missiles in Kaliningrad could target NATO troops heading from Poland.

Here's What You Need to Remember: Air defenses ring Russia’s Western periphery. S-300 and S-400 anti-aircraft missiles cover half of Poland and overlap in concentric circles over the Baltic States — requiring NATO to neutralize these sites during a conflict before its aircraft could provide cover for Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.

The first of 3,500 American troops began rolling into Poland for a nine-month-long mission starting on Jan. 8, 2017. It was an unprecedented length of time for a U.S. armored unit to stay in Eastern Europe. The U.S. Army’s 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division were heading to Zagan and Pomorskie, with the unit’s 87 M-1 Abrams tanks following on trains.

It’s the beginning of a bulked-up and continuous NATO troop rotation to counter a resurgent Russia. In addition to the tanks, the unit is bringing with it 18 self-propelled Paladin howitzers, hundreds of Humvees, and 144 Bradley fighting vehicles which will spread out across Eastern Europe.

At the time, there hadn’t been a U.S. military deployment in Europe this big since the Cold War.

But as the troops moved beyond Zagan, they fell under the shadow of Russia’s land-based strike missiles in Kaliningrad, the Connecticut-sized enclave squeezed between Poland, Lithuania, and the Baltic Sea. Russia has invested heavily in building up its military presence there in recent years.

In the event of a military conflict over the Baltic States, Russian missiles in Kaliningrad could target NATO troops heading from Poland. That could slow reinforcements were Russia to invade Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.

The Baltics would need those NATO reinforcements to have a chance, slim as it would be, to stop a vastly more numerous Russian army. Indeed, Russia’s army is smaller than it once was, but it is “more than adequate … to overwhelm whatever defense the Baltic armies might be able to present,” a RAND Corporation study noted in 2016.

Kaliningrad’s missiles pose a serious complication to NATO. The enclave is practically loaded with them.

Russia/NATO A2AD

For a visual illustration, here’s an interactive map — larger version here — showing these missile “bubbles” indicating the range of various weapons in Europe. The map was produced by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank.

The map can display the ranges of various Russian land attack, air defense, and naval strike weapons near its borders. It’s not comprehensive and there are fixed points of reference for naval weapons — which, of course, would vary in location during an actual conflict.

For NATO, you can select options to show the range of the alliance’s land-attack naval weapons and its air defenses, along with the location of key PODS — or ports of debarkations — where the alliance could land reinforcements by air and sea.

While none of this information is new, it is humbling when displayed graphically. Russian Iskander M ballistic missiles, packing 1,500-pound high-explosive warheads, can reach hundreds of miles into Poland. The entirety of the Baltic States, of course, are within range.

The NATO base at Zagan is just on the edge of the Iskander M’s envelope.

On multiple occasions in 2015 and 2016, Russian warships launched SS-N-30 Kalibr cruise missiles from the Caspian Sea into Syria, requiring the missiles to travel from 1,000 miles away. Similar to the U.S. Tomahawk cruise missile, the Kalibrs could likewise reach most of Europe from ships in the Black Sea, the Baltic or from beyond the Arctic Circle.

Russia’s navy has declined since the Soviet era and is best suited today for coastal defense and regional power projection, but the Kremlin doesn’t need a large navy to fulfill these objectives. In the Caspian, Russia relied on small, Buyan-class missile boats to fire the Kalibrs, which Russia also keeps in its Baltic Sea Fleet.

Air defenses ring Russia’s Western periphery. S-300 and S-400 anti-aircraft missiles cover half of Poland and overlap in concentric circles over the Baltic States — requiring NATO to neutralize these sites during a conflict before its aircraft could provide cover for Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.

But the map also displays Russia’s clear vulnerabilities.

NATO warships with Tomahawk missiles could easily reach Russia’s biggest cities — and strike the center of government power — from a considerable distance away.

In short — war would be chaotic, brutal, and terrible.

Oslo (AFP)

Norway's main opposition Labour Party on Friday rejected a government plan to decriminalise the personal use of drugs in small quantities, saying the measure could incite young people to experiment with narcotics.

Under the centre-right coalition government's proposal submitted in February, both the possession and use of small quantities of drugs, including heroin, cocaine and cannabis, would no longer have been punishable under the criminal code, but users would still have had to seek help.

The ruling party however needed backing from the opposition in parliament in order for the bill to be approved.

Although the Labour Party is in principal in favour of doing away with penalties for heavy drug users, it is against decriminalising drug use for the wider population.

Proponents of the bill argued that criminal prosecution of drug users can be counterproductive as it deters those with abuse problems from seeking help, makes it more difficult for relatives to detect problems and stigmatises an already vulnerable demographic.

Although the bill was rejected on Friday, negotiations could still lead to a different text decriminalising heavy drug use being adopted.

Despite having one of the highest living standards in Europe, Norway -- and other Nordic countries -- have seen higher numbers of drug-related deaths per capita than the rest of Europe.

In recent years, 260 people have died annually from a drug overdose in Norway, according to a report published last year by the Norwegian Directorate of Health.

The United Nations Security Council is expected to meet Thursday on the situation in Tigray, where thousands of people have been killed and the United States has alleged ethnic cleansing in the western part of the region of 6 million people. The term refers to forcing a population from a region through expulsions and other violence, often including killings and rapes.

Citing several witnesses, Amnesty International said in a statement on Wednesday that Eritrean soldiers passing through the town of Adwa on Monday started shooting “unprovoked” at passers-by, killing at least three people and wounding at least 19.

Six of the wounded were in critical condition, a medical worker at the local referral hospital told the human rights group.

Amnesty’s regional director, Sarah Jackson, called the shooting “yet another unlawful attack by Eritrean troops on civilians in Tigray.”

The spokeswoman for Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, Billene Seyoum, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Abiy last month for the first time acknowledged publicly, after months of denials, that Eritrean soldiers were in Tigray. The United Nations secretary-general once said Abiy had “guaranteed” the Eritreans were not there.

Ethiopia early this month said the Eritrean soldiers had begun to leave.

But witnesses have told The Associated Press that the soldiers roamed freely in parts of Tigray, looting and killing, as they supported Ethiopian security forces and other allied fighters in pursuing the now-fugitive Tigray leaders. Eritrea’s government has long been an enemy of the Tigray leaders.

Deadly fighting continues in several parts of Tigray, as what began as a political dispute between Abiy’s government and the Tigray leaders who once dominated Ethiopia’s government for nearly three decades turned into war.",311,2045,8,59

Russia accused a Ukrainian diplomat on Saturday of trying to obtain classified information and ordered him to leave the country by April 22, prompting a like-for-like response from Ukraine as border tensions simmer.

Russia's FSB security service said Oleksandr Sosoniuk had been detained when he tried to access information from Russian law enforcement databases during a meeting with a Russian citizen.

The foreign ministry gave Sosoniuk 72 hours to leave, and Ukraine then did likewise to a Russian diplomat in Kyiv.

Ukraine's foreign ministry said Sosoniuk had been held for several hours before being allowed to return to his consulate in St Petersburg, and called the detention a provocation.

""We fully deny the accusations levelled against the consular officer,"" it said in a statement.

Tensions between Moscow and Kyiv have been rising amid a build-up of Russian troops along the border and clashes in eastern Ukraine between the army and pro-Russian separatists.

0,China dollar issuers face pressure on Huarong debt concerns,https://www.reuters.com/article/china-huarong-bonds/china-dollar-issuers-face-pressure-on-huarong-debt-concerns-idUSL1N2M809G,"SHANGHAI, April 15 (Reuters) - An index of China dollar issuers fell to a 10-month low this week as concerns increase over Chinese issuers’ creditworthiness after asset management giant China Huarong Asset Management Co delayed the release of its annual results.

The delay by a company that counts China’s Ministry of Finance as its biggest shareholder has prompted worries that any restructuring could leave holders of its U.S. dollar bonds unprotected, raising doubts about the creditworthiness of Chinese issuers even as foreign investors have flocked to the market.

The ICE Bank of America Asian Dollar Investment Grade Corporate China Issuers Index was last at 212.756, its lowest level since June 15, 2020, and down 2.5% from a record high in February.

Huarong, a manager of non-performing loans set up by the government two decades ago and one of China’s four biggest asset management companies (AMCs), has had its Hong Kong shares suspended since March 31 after it announced a delay in its earnings report due to a “relevant transaction” yet to be finalised.

The yield on a February 2030 dollar bond of Huarong’s subsidiary’s Huarong Finance 2019 Co was last quoted at 10.154%, up from 3.775% on March 31.

The company and its subsidiaries currently have outstanding bonds worth $51.72 billion, of which $16.59 billion is due to mature this year, according to Refinitiv data.

“The offshore bond price continues to slide as there are no rumours, or proposals, or anything about how to deal with (Huarong’s) offshore debts,” said a fund manager in Hong Kong.

Calls to Huarong went unanswered on Thursday.

Global rating agencies Moody’s and Fitch this week placed Huarong’s ratings on review for possible downgrades, citing uncertainty following the company’s delayed results.

Worries have spilled into the broader market, lifting the cost of insurance against a default in China’s dollar debt to its highest since October.

The ITRAXX credit default swap index for Asia has widened to 80 basis points (bps), from 63 a week ago.

Onshore investors have displayed more faith in Huarong’s ability to meet its obligations, with the spread of one-year AA rated corporate debt over the government benchmark rising less than 3 basis points over the past month.

Analysts also see little risk of a major debt restructuring.

“We see poor risk-reward for a major debt restructuring, particularly given no urgent need ... Our recent channel check with banks also shows a clear signal of no major debt restructuring from policymakers. Hence, we expect a manageable impact on the system,” analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note.

Huarong faced financing challenges and a sell-off in its stock in 2018 after then-chairman Lai Xiaomin was targeted in an anti-corruption investigation.

It has been under a spotlight this year since Lai was executed in January following his conviction on bribery charges.

A Tianjin court found Lai guilty of taking a record 1.79 billion yuan in bribes, colluding with others to embezzle 25.1 million yuan of public funds, and bigamy, in the country’s biggest financial corruption case since the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949.

Under Lai’s tenure, Huarong expanded rapidly to become a broader financial holding company, and created a massive pile of distressed debt through its investments during the period.

As of mid-2020, Huarong had 160 billion yuan in net assets, and more than 30 billion yuan in loan-loss provisions. ($1 = 6.5387 Chinese yuan) (Reporting by Andrew Galbraith in Shanghai; Additional reporting by Cheng Leng in Beijing; Editing by Kim Coghill)",583,3623,9,59
0,Salvini ordered to stand trial on migrant kidnapping charge,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/17/italys-salvini-sent-to-trial-on-migrant-kidnapping-charge,"Rescue group hails decision to put far-right Italian politician on trial, which will begin in September.

An Italian judge has ordered that Matteo Salvini, leader of the far-right League party, must stand trial on charges of kidnapping over his decision to prevent more than 100 refugees and migrants on a rescue ship from landing in the country in 2019.

Salvini, who was interior minister and deputy prime minister at that time, left the people stranded at sea until prosecutors ordered the seizure of the ship and the evacuation of the people on board.

The trial will begin in the southern city of Palermo on September 15.

Proactiva Open Arms, the Spanish NGO which operated the Open Arms rescue ship at the heart of the case, welcomed the judge’s ruling.

“Violating a fundamental right such as the protection of human beings at sea for the sake of political propaganda is shameful,” said its founder Oscar Camps, adding that the trial would be “an opportunity to judge a period of European history”.

During the standoff, some of the people threw themselves overboard in desperation as the captain pleaded for a safe, close port. Eventually after a 19-day ordeal, the remaining 83 people still on board were allowed to disembark in Lampedusa.

Salvini, who has built much of his political fortune on an anti-immigration campaign, could face up to 15 years in prison if found guilty at the end of a tortuous, three-stage judicial process.

A definitive conviction could bar him from government office.

“I am going to trial with my head held high, in your name as well as mine. Italy first, always,” Salvini tweeted immediately after the ruling.

“Defending our country is a citizen’s sacred duty … that is what I am being tried for.”

During his 14 months as interior minister, Salvini stopped several boats from docking in Italy in an effort to halt migrant flows, and regularly accused the charities that operated them of effectively encouraging people smuggling.

He withdrew the League from the coalition government in the summer of 2019 in a failed bid to trigger an election when his party was riding high in the polls.

The League, now part of Mario Draghi’s two-month-old national unity government, has lost more than 10 points of voter support but remains the most popular party in Italy on about 23 percent, according to most opinion polls.

Salvini is also under investigation for another, similar standoff involving the Italian coastguard ship Gregoretti that Salvini refused to let dock in the summer of 2019.

The prosecutor in that case, Catania, Sicily prosecutor Andrea Bonomo, recommended last week that Salvini not be put on trial, arguing that he was carrying out government policy when he kept the 116 migrants at sea for five days.",461,2760,9,59
0,Woman who coughed on Bay Area Uber driver pleads not guilty,https://apnews.com/3795c3b2f3e43f348924b969e7b89f33,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A woman who was caught on video coughing on and grabbing an Uber driver in San Francisco who ended the ride because she wasn’t wearing a mask has pleaded not guilty to assault and other charges, authorities said.

Arna Kimiai, 24, entered pleas Monday to felonies of assault and attempted first-degree robbery along with misdemeanor charges of battery on a transit employee and violating a local health ordinance. She remains free on bail pending a May 3 hearing.

Kimiai is accused of attacking Subhakar Khadka, 32, on March 7 after he had picked up three passengers in the Portola district but then stopped the car because he noticed she wasn’t wearing a face mask, which was required under anti-COVID-19 health orders.

Video provided by the driver showed a maskless woman, later identified as Kimiai, coughing on him, grabbing his cellphone and ripping off his face mask.

Police also said that as three women exited the vehicle, one sprayed what was believed to be pepper spray toward the driver.

Kimiai surrendered to police a week after the attack and also apologized on social media.

LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) — Pakistan briefly blocked access to all social media on Friday after days of violent anti-French protests across the country by radical Islamists opposed to cartoons they consider blasphemous.

Sites including Twitter and Facebook were blocked for four hours on orders from the country’s interior ministry, said Khurram Mehran, a spokesman for Pakistan’s media regulatory agency. He gave no further details.

The move comes as police officials prepare to clear a large demonstration in the eastern city of Lahore, and just hours after the government said the now-detained leader of the outlawed Islamist political party at the forefront of the protests had urged his supporters to stand down.

By releasing a note they say was handwritten by Saad Rizvi, the government hopes to calm tensions after his Tehreek-e-Labiak Pakistan party stirred up the violent protests — in which four police officers were killed and 600 injured. France urged its citizens to leave the country.

Three demonstrators also died in the clashes with security agencies, and the government has imposed a ban on the party with Prime Minister Imran Khan’s approval. Khan took to Twitter on Friday to pay tributes to policemen killed or injured in the violence. He said the violence was aimed at creating chaos and blackmailing his government.

Khan’s government also banned coverage of Rizvi’s party by the local media, while police registered cases against Rizvi for inciting violence that resulted in the killing of policemen.

A photo of the statement was released earlier by an advisor to the prime minister on Twitter, but neither Rizvi himself or any of his party leadership was immediately available for comment. Some of his followers insisted they hear or see the words come from Rizvi himself before stopping, and the Lahore protest continued after Friday prayers.

On Thursday, the French embassy in Pakistan advised all of its nationals and companies to temporarily leave the Islamic country, after violence erupted over Rizvi’s arrest.

Violent protests have ongoing in Lahore since Monday, damaging private and public property and disrupting the much-need supply of oxygen to hospitals. Some of the affected included COVID-19 patients, who were on oxygen support.

In the statement, Rizvi asked his supporters to peacefully disperse for the good of the country and end their main sit-in that began Monday, when police arrested the radical cleric for threatening protests if the government did not expel the French ambassador before April 20.

Rizvi’s arrest sparked violent protests by his followers, who disrupted traffic by staging sit-ins across the country. Although security forces cleared almost all of the rallies, thousands of Rizvi’s followers are still assembled in Lahore, vowing to die in order to protect the honor of Islam’s Prophet Muhammad.

Rizvi became the leader of the outlawed Tehreek-e-Labiak Pakistan party in November after the sudden death of his father, Khadim Hussein Rizvi. His party also wants the government to boycott French products.

ADVERTISEMENT

Rizvi’s party has denounced French President Emmanuel Macron since October last year, saying he tried to defend blasphemous caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad as freedom of expression. Macron had spoken after a young Muslim beheaded a French school teacher who had shown caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad in class.

The images had been republished by the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo to mark the opening of the trial over the deadly 2015 attack against the publication for the original caricatures.

That enraged many Muslims in Pakistan and elsewhere who believe those depictions were blasphemous. Rizvi’s group in recent years became known for opposing any change to the country’s harsh blasphemy laws, under which anyone accused of insulting Islam or other religious figures can be sentenced to death if found guilty.

0,Senate Democrats urge Biden to deny funds for Brazil Amazon,https://www.thestar.com/news/world/americas/2021/04/16/senate-democrats-urge-biden-to-deny-funds-for-brazil-amazon.html,"RIO DE JANEIRO - More than a dozen Senate Democrats sent a letter to U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday complaining of a woeful environmental track record by his Brazilian counterpart, Jair Bolsonaro, and urging him to condition any support for Amazon preservation on significant progress reducing deforestation.

The letter was signed by senators including Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and Bob Menendez, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. It comes just days before Biden is expected to meet with Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders at a U.S.-organized climate summit that was a major plank of his campaign pledge to more aggressively fight climate change.

The letter seems aimed at curtailing a fledgling bid by Bolsonaro, a far-right climate skeptic who was a staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, to refashion himself as a willing partner of Biden on the environment in the hopes of securing billions of dollars in foreign aid to promote sustainable development in the Amazon.

The senators warn that failure to slow deforestation will also affect their willingness to support Brazil’s bid to join the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development — a long-sought goal of Bolsonaro.

The 15 senators, who also include former presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, said they support co-operation on the Amazon between the U.S. and Brazilian governments, but questioned Bolsonaro’s credibility.

“President Bolsonaro’s rhetoric and policies have effectively given a green light to the dangerous criminals operating in the Amazon, allowing them to dramatically expand their activities, ” the senators wrote in the letter obtained by The Associated Press, citing recent reporting on abuses by Human Rights Watch.

A U.S.-Brazil partnership “can only be possible if the Bolsonaro administration begins to take Brazil’s climate commitments seriously — and only if it protects, supports, and engages meaningfully with the many Brazilians who can help the country fulfil them,” the lawmakers add.

Bolsonaro has sided with powerful agribusiness interests, cast aspersions on environmental activists and snarled at European leaders who decried deforestation in the Amazon as destruction of the world’s largest rainforest has surged toward its worst level since 2008.

On the campaign trail, Biden proposed countries provide Brazil with $20 billion to fight deforestation and said the country should face repercussions if it fails. At the time, Bolsonaro labeled Biden’s comments as “regrettable” and “disastrous.”

Bilateral talks on the environment with Brazil began on Feb. 17, led by Biden’s special climate envoy, John Kerry, The two sides have held regular technical meetings in the run-up to the April 22-23 climate summit, which is taking place online due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Brazil is striving to show its shift in rhetoric amounts to more than empty talk.

In a seven-page letter addressed to Biden on April 14, Bolsonaro recognized that his government needs to boost its performance curtailing illegal logging. He also said he supports sustainable development with economic alternatives for the region’s impoverished residents and that he is committed to eliminating illegal deforestation by 2030.

To accomplish those goals, he said Brazil will require outside resources, adding that aid from the U.S. government would be “very welcome.”

Rubens Barbosa, a former Brazilian ambassador to the U.S., said it remains to be seen whether the tone of Bolsonaro’s letter will match his speech at the summit.

Brazil’s Environment Minister Ricardo Salles recently told reporters he is seeking $1 billion in foreign assistance to support efforts to reduce deforestation by 30% to 40% in 12 months and that, without that sum, he would be unable to set a target. Brazilian spending to protect the environment has been sliding for years, and under Bolsonaro the ministry’s budget outlook plunged another 25% this year, the lowest level in two decades.

The ministry didn’t respond to an AP request for comment about its proposals.

The U.S. senators argue Biden must see success before writing a check. They argue Bolsonaro has derided the environmental regulator and sabotaged its enforcement capabilities, sought to weaken protections for Indigenous territories, exhibited contempt for environmentalists and been reluctant to curb lawlessness that fuels destruction and violence.

“Any U.S. assistance to Brazil related to the Amazon should be conditioned on the Brazilian government making significant and sustained progress in two critical areas: reducing deforestation and ending impunity for environmental crimes and acts of intimidation and violence against forest defenders,” the senators wrote.

Climatologists have warned that continued deforestation will push the Amazon beyond a tipping point, and its subsequent decomposition would release hundreds of billions of tons of carbon dioxide, making the Paris Agreement’s climate goals even harder to achieve.

However, Brazil has shown itself capable of driving down Amazon deforestation in the past, having reached all-time low in 2012. That started ticking upwards in the years thereafter, then exploded in the first year of Bolsonaro’s administration and rose again last year.

Amid outcry from European governments and threats of divestment by institutional investors, Bolsonaro in 2019 placed the army in charge of tamping down deforestation, despite experts’ criticism that soldiers are both costly and untrained for such missions.

Preliminary data indicates deforestation has started declining from its record level, though it remains well above the average of the preceding decade. Vice-President Hamilton Mourão, a general who leads the program, announced earlier that the army-led program will end at the end of April, returning enforcement duties to environmental agencies.

“Brazilian officials have been scrambling to present Bolsonaro as a committed ally of the Biden administration on climate issues,” said Daniel Wilkinson, who runs Human Rights Watch’s environmental program. “His new climate-friendly rhetoric simply cannot — and should not — be taken seriously in the absence of actual results.”

The senators’ rebuke comes amid a flurry of domestic efforts in Brazil to cast Bolsonaro’s administration as a bad-faith negotiator.

More than 200 nongovernment organizations and networks signed a letter that said climate negotiations with the U.S. and other foreign governments are taking place out of the public view and that no Amazon solutions can be expected from closed-door meetings. They said talks shouldn’t advance until Brazil has cut deforestation rates.

A video produced by the Association of Brazil’s Indigenous Peoples also warned Biden not to trust Bolsonaro to negotiate the Amazon’s future.

Barbosa, who was Brazil’s ambassador to the U.S. for both centre-right and leftist governments from 1999 to 2004, said Bolsonaro will face difficulty overcoming the “credibility gap” created by his newfound discourse about fighting deforestation and the negative results of the last few years.

“Those two things must be reconciled,” he said. “Until then, no one will enter into serious negotiations with Brazil to transfer resources.”

0,Scientists find only 3% of land areas unblemished by humans,https://www.reuters.com/world/scientists-find-only-3-land-areas-unblemished-by-humans-2021-04-16/,"A member of the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio) walks next a tractor used for deforestation at the National Forest Bom Futuro in Rio Pardo, Rondonia State, Brazil, September 13, 2019. REUTERS/Bruno Kelly

Very little of today’s world resembles Planet Earth from 500 years ago. In fact, only about 3% of land surfaces might be ecologically intact -- still home to their full range of native species and unblemished by human activity, according to new research.

The finding -- published Thursday in the journal Frontiers in Forests and Global Change -- is far lower than previous estimates based on satellite images, which suggested around 20% to 40% of land ecosystems were undamaged.

For the new study, however, scientists conducted an extensive survey of forest cover and species losses to understand better what was happening beneath the world’s tree canopies.

""I was particularly surprised to see how low it really is,"" said Andrew Plumptre, a conservation biologist at the University of Cambridge. ""It shows how rare such intact places are. It's scary just how little the world looks like what it was just 500 years ago.""

The term ecosystem describes the complex relationships within a natural area that, altogether, help to sustain a healthy and balanced diversity of life. Lose just one or two key species, and the whole system could fall apart.

Today’s still-pristine habitats, containing the same species abundance as in the year 1500 A.D., were mostly found in regions considered less hospitable for humans, including the Sahara Desert and chilly regions of Greenland and northern Canada.

Other intact habitats were in areas under extreme pressure from deforestation and development, including parts of the Amazon in Latin America.

The authors argue that these areas should be a priority for future conservation. Though currently, only 11% of these areas are under protection, the study found.

""The idea of focusing on intact areas is so that you don’t have to work to remove the human footprint,"" Plumptre said.

Some scientists, however, questioned the extremely low figure, saying it could be attributed to the study using a particularly narrow definition of ""intact habitats"" -- those with their full, historical collection of animals and plants.

""We need practical actions to ensure species and ecosystems survive,"" said Stuart Pimm, a conservation scientist at Duke University.

He also questioned the study authors' call for protecting still-intact areas, noting frozen or desert patches are not the most abundant with species. ""Encouraging nations to protect remote, sparsely populated areas won't do biodiversity a lot of good,"" Pimm said.

An effort led by the United Nations to protect 30% of the planet’s land and waters by 2030 - up from about 17% currently under some form of protection - has gained momentum over the last year, as governments including the United States have pledged to commit more land to conservation.

Some conservationists argue, however, that the world’s conservation goal should be much higher than 30% in order to prevent mass die-offs of species. A 2019 U.N. report estimated as many as 1 million species are under threat of extinction due to human activity.

“30 by 30 is a nice catchphrase, but it won’t do much good if the areas to be protected are not selected carefully,” Pimm said.

0,'Narcocat' intercepted with drug delivery for Panama prison,https://news.yahoo.com/narcocat-intercepted-drug-delivery-panama-205222179.html,"Authorities in Panama on Friday intercepted an unlikely smuggler, a fluffy white cat, bearing an assortment of drugs in a pouch tied to its body as it tried to enter a prison.

The feline felon was stopped outside the Nueva Esperanza jail, which houses more than 1,700 prisoners, in the Caribbean province of Colon, north of the capital Panama City.

""The animal had a cloth tied around its neck"" that contained wrapped packages of white powder, leaves and ""vegetable matter"", according to Andres Gutierrez, head of the Panama Penitentiary System.

They were likely cocaine, crack and marihuana, according to another official.

This is not the first such attempted critter crime.

Prisoners use food to lure animals to them, once the creatures had been loaded with drugs by people on the outside.

The office of the drugs prosecutor of Colon said on Twitter it had opened an investigation into the use of animals for smuggling illegal substances into the Nueva Esperanza Prison.

It posted photographs of the drugs, and of the cat caught in the act.

The animal will be taken to a pet adoption center, according to prosecutor Eduardo Rodriguez.

Panama has some 18,000 inmates in 23 prisons, most of them overcrowded.

On previous occasions, authorities have intercepted attempted drug deliveries using homing pigeons and even drones.

0,Reparations bill approved out of committee in historic vote,https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/15/reparations-bill-committee-historic-vote-481811,"The bill does not lay out provisions for the shape the reparations would take, whether in the form of direct cash payments or safety net programs. Despite its open-ended design, getting buy-in from enough lawmakers to tee up a floor vote in even one half of Congress is a tall order.

On a Wednesday press call, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer dodged questions about whether he would bring the bill to the floor and tried to put the onus on Biden, suggesting the president create his own reparations commission .

While both parties have been reticent to embrace reparations legislation in the past, the majority of Republicans oppose it. A February POLITICO/Morning Consult poll found that 60 percent of Democrats support the formation of a committee to study reparations while 74 percent of Republicans oppose it. Many on the right argue that today’s lawmakers should not be held responsible for mistakes of the past, like enslavement.

Yet given the ongoing national reckoning on race and systemic racism — now reignited by the trial of Derek Chauvin and a second high-profile police killing in Brooklyn Center, Minn. — reparations advocates say now is a prime opportunity to move reparations legislation forward. It currently has 180 co-sponsors in the House, the most ever. And even with Democrats’ slimmed-down House majority, which includes multiple hesitant moderates, it is in its best position yet to pass that chamber. Doing so would mark a major victory for reparations proponents and racial justice advocates alike.

“I don't think that there's any opposition that can get in the way of passing it out of the House,” said Dreisen Heath, a program advocate at Human Rights Watch. “We're very confident.”

But beyond a House victory, the fate of H.R. 40 — and its chances of ultimately making it to Joe Biden’s desk — is bleak. The White House has maintained that Biden supports the study of reparations and Vice President (then-Senator) Kamala Harris co-sponsored companion legislation in 2019. Still, full passage of the bill would require votes from all 50 Senate Democrats and 10 Republicans, who are almost certain to oppose it.

“The Senate is not a good place to be with this legislation, or any legislation that's progressive and advances the interest of African Americans in particular,” said Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), chair of the House Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, during a Monday press call.

“You’ve got to have ten Republicans right now,” Cohen continued. “And there are not that many of them that are going to quit and not run again, and have a come-to-Jesus moment.”

Rep. Burgess Owens (R-Utah), who is African American, called the legislation “treacherous” and “traitorous” during his testimony on Wednesday, suggesting that the disenfranchisement of Black Americans is the fault of failed Democratic policies rather than the legacy of enslavement or systematic disenfranchisement.

“If you want to pay back the African American community, give us back our history,” Owens said. “We are not a hapless, hopeless race. We’re just like everybody else.”

House Judiciary Republicans echoed these complaints during Wednesday’s committee markup. Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) argued that Democrats should be solely responsible for paying for the commission, saying that their party was most responsible for policies that disproportionately hurt Black Americans.

“I hope that we won’t compound some horrendous sins by punishing great grandchildren of people that did wrong,” Gohmert said.

Explaining the terms of the bill and defining the role of the commission will be crucial to the efforts to get more Republicans on board, Democrats say. The bill’s Senate companion currently has 16 co-sponsors. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas), lead sponsor of H.R. 40, said the bill represents in large part an acknowledgment of past harms done, or a “national apology” to African Americans. She said she expects the commission to identify both the legacy of slavery and specific policy measures that have systematically disenfranchised African Americans.

“We're committed to establishing this H.R 40 as an enabling legislation to address the deep seated racism, and historic and systemic elements of mistreatment of African Americans through the centuries,” Lee said in a Monday press call.

In a statement issued on Thursday, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), sponsor of the Senate bill, lauded the House bill's advancement.

“Our nation has not yet fully acknowledged and grappled with the painful legacy of slavery, white supremacy, and systemic racism that tainted this country’s founding and continues to persist in deep racial disparities and inequalities today, Booker said. ""It’s important that we right the wrongs of our nation’s most discriminatory policies that halted the upward mobility of African-American communities for generations, and we cannot truly move forward without first fully documenting the extent of the harms of the past.""

Some advocates have suggested that the end goal of the legislation — establishment of a commission to study reparations — could be more easily achieved through an executive order .

So far, White House officials have not indicated they're prepared to apply further pressure on Congress. Lee brushed off the suggestion on Monday, underlining her commitment to passing the legislation in both chambers of Congress.

“Our present [White House] leadership also indicated their understanding and support,” Lee said. But we are now on a legislative drive … any further strategies will be certainly addressed as needed.”

At the same time, the concept of reparations is gaining traction in some municipalities across the country. Evanston, Ill., became the first city to craft a reparations policy for its residents in March. The plan allocates $10 million over the next ten years in $25,000 housing assistance payments to qualifying descendants of Black Evanston residents who were victims of housing discrimination. While H.R. 40 does not allocate for payments to African Americans, reparations advocates have cited the Evanston plan as one potential model.

However, some reparations advocates remain skeptical of a model like Evanston’s, which focuses largely on housing and would not advance the ultimate goal of closing the racial wealth gap.

“Certainly there are ongoing issues that residents bring to their city governments to address harms,” said Kirsten Mullen, a writer and researcher whose work has centered on reparations. “But they shouldn't be confused with the goals of a national reparations program for Black American descendants of U.S. slavery.”",1119,7097,9,59

Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a statement said the Ugandan government’s actions “represent a continued downward trajectory for the country’s democracy and respect for human rights.“ The election in which longtime President Yoweri Museveni won a sixth term “was neither free nor fair,“ Blinken said.

The statement did not say who is affected by the visa restrictions.

The election was a generational clash between Museveni, 76, and the popular singer and opposition lawmaker known as Bobi Wine 39, who was detained and harassed multiple times ahead of the vote. Wine later alleged widespread irregularities in the election.

Blinken said that “opposition candidates were routinely harassed, arrested, and held illegally without charge. Ugandan security forces were responsible for the deaths and injuries of dozens of innocent bystanders and opposition supporters.” Civil society figures were intimidated and arrested, and journalists were targeted with violence, he said.

Uganda’s government limited accreditation for election observers to the point where the United States decided not to observe at all.

0,"US expels Russian diplomats, imposes new round of sanctions",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/04/14/united-states-poised-announce-sanctions-hacking-campaign/7232909002/,"WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden expelled 10 Russian diplomats and sanctioned more than three dozen individuals and companies Thursday in retaliation for a massive cyberhacking of federal agencies and interference in the 2020 presidential election.

Biden’s second round of sanctions aimed at Russian President Vladimir Putin are tougher and more sweeping than the last. Russia is accused of hacking the networks of at least nine federal agencies five months ago to gather U.S. secrets in the SolarWinds cyberbreach.

Russia also allegedly tried to influence the 2020 presidential election by waging disinformation campaigns to help the candidacy of Donald Trump, mirroring meddling efforts in the 2016 election.

For the first time, the Biden administration publicly identified the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, also known as APT 29, Cozy Bear and The Dukes, as the perpetrator of the SolarWinds attack, which the United States said gave Russia the ability to infect or potentially spy on 16,000 computer systems worldwide. Russia is accused of infecting software with malicious code to execute the broad-scope cyber espionage campaign.

The Biden administration sanctioned six Russian technology companies that provide support to Russia’s cyberprogram in addition to 32 entities and individuals accused of carrying out Russian government-directed attempts to influence the election. The United States joined with the European Union and other allies to sanction eight other individuals and entities associated with Russia’s occupation in Crimea.

The 10 diplomats expelled from the Russian Embassy in Washington include representatives of intelligence services, the White House said.

Targeting Russia's financial sector, the U.S. Treasury Department directed U.S. financial institutions to not participate in the primary market for ruble or non-ruble denominated bonds issued after June 14 by Russian banking institutions. The action gives the U.S. government authority to expand sovereign debt sanctions on Russia.

In brief remarks from the White House, Biden said he told Putin in a phone call Tuesday that ""we could have gone further, but I chose not to do so. I chose to be proportionate.""

""The United States is not looking to kick off a cycle of escalation and conflict with Russia. We want a stable, predictable relationship. If Russia continues to interfere with our democracy, I'm prepared to take further actions to respond.""

Biden added that there are areas where the U.S. and Russia ""can and should work together,"" pointing to arms control and the recent five-year extension of the New START Treaty limiting nuclear arsenals of the two nations.

A senior Biden administration official, who spoke about the actions on the condition of anonymity, said other responses against Russia will “remain unseen” in the public eye.

The White House singled out reports that Russia encouraged Taliban attacks against U.S. troops in Afghanistan but said the new actions aren’t tied to the alleged bounties because of “low-to-moderate confidence” in the intelligence. The White House said the response to the alleged bounties are “being handled through diplomatic, military and intelligence channels.”

In March, the Biden administration sanctioned Russia over the poisoning and detention of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.

Additional sanctions against Russia had been telegraphed by the Biden administration for weeks.

Tuesday, in his second phone call with Putin as president, Biden previewed the actions, telling him that the United States “will act firmly in defense of its national interest” in response to cyber intrusion and election interference. He called for Putin to “de-escalate tensions” after Russia’s military buildup in Crimea and on Ukraine’s borders. Biden proposed a summit meeting in a third country this summer with Putin to discuss U.S.-Russian relations.

""Our teams are discussing that possibility right now,"" Biden said. ""And out of that summit – were it to occur and I believe it will – the United States and Russia could launch a strategic stability dialogue.""

The new actions are certain to further heighten tensions building between Putin and Biden after the Russian leader enjoyed a warmer relationship with Trump.

In a television interview last month, Biden said Putin would ""pay a price"" for Moscow's interference in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Biden was asked whether he thought Putin is a killer. ""I do,"" the president responded. In response, Russia recalled its ambassador to the United States, and Putin pointed at the U.S. history of slavery and slaughtering Native Americans and the atomic bombing of Japan in World War II.

""My bottom line is this,"" Biden said. ""When there is interest to work with Russia, we should and we will. And when Russia seeks to violate the interests of the United States, we will respond.""

Asked whether Putin gave any indication he will change his behavior, Biden said, ""My hope and my expectation is we will be able to work out a modus vivendi.""

In response to the Navalny poisoning, the Biden administration sanctioned seven senior members of the Russian government last month. The United States added 14 entities to the Department of Commerce's blacklist, mirroring sanctions imposed by the European Union and the United Kingdom over the attempted murder of Navalny. The sanctions prevent top figures allied with Putin from accessing financial and property assets in the USA.

Previous administrations' actions have failed to change Moscow’s behavior, including Russian hacking. After Russian meddling in the 2016 election, the Obama administration expelled diplomats from the USA. Though Trump was often reluctant to criticize Putin, his administration expelled diplomats in 2018 for Russia's alleged poisoning of an ex-intelligence officer in Britain.

""We can't predict what the impact will be,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. ""But we still believe when there is unacceptable behavior, we should put consequences in place.""

U.S. officials are still grappling with the aftereffects of the SolarWinds intrusion, which affected agencies including the Treasury, Justice, Energy and Homeland Security Departments, and assessing what information may have been stolen. The breach exposed weaknesses in the federal government's cyberdefenses.

0,NASA selects SpaceX as its sole provider for a lunar lander,https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/04/nasa-selects-spacex-as-its-sole-provider-for-a-lunar-lander/,"In an extraordinary announcement on Friday, NASA said that it has selected SpaceX and its Starship vehicle to serve as the lunar lander for its Artemis Program. This is NASA's plan to return humans to the Moon later this decade.

About a year ago, NASA gave initial study and preliminary development contracts for Moon landers to SpaceX, Dynetics, and a team of aerospace heavyweights led by Blue Origin. The cost of SpaceX's bid was about half that of Dynetics, and one-fourth the amount received by Blue Origin. That frugality, at least in part, led NASA on Friday to choose SpaceX as the sole provider of landing services during the down-select phase.

""We looked at what’s the best value to the government,"" said Kathy Lueders, chief of the human exploration program for NASA, during a teleconference with reporters on Friday.

NASA said it will award SpaceX $2.89 billion for development of the Starship vehicle and two flights. One of these missions will be an uncrewed flight test of Starship down to the lunar surface and back. The second mission will be a crewed flight—the first one of the Artemis program—down to the Moon.

Starship offered several advantages, NASA officials said. It has a spacious cabin for astronauts, two airlocks, and ample payload capability to bring large numbers of experiments to the Moon and return samples to Earth. Significantly, the NASA engineers also praised the vehicle's innovative design and future-looking technology that might also one day be used on Mars.

Ultimately, the selection criteria were based on a company's technical proficiency, management, and cost. SpaceX scored well in all three. But budget appears to have been the biggest factor. The space agency has had difficulty securing funding from Congress for the lunar lander aspect of the program. For the current fiscal year, NASA said it needed $3.3 billion in funding to meet the goal of landing humans on the Moon by 2024. Congress provided just $850 million, and as a result, NASA acknowledged that 2024 was no longer a realistic target.

Making Artemis affordable

At the direction of the Trump administration, NASA formally created the Artemis Program about two years ago to send humans back to the Moon in a sustainable way and establish a base there. The goal was to move beyond the flags-and-footprints forays of the Apollo Program and gain the knowledge needed to eventually send humans to Mars. The Biden administration has endorsed this basic goal, and it's working to update the Artemis Program with a more realistic timeline given the budget predilections of Congress.

Friday's announcement is part of that process of making Artemis more affordable. A sole-source award to SpaceX for the Human Landing System will certainly not be particularly popular in Congress, where traditional space companies such as Lockheed Martin and newer entrants like Blue Origin have more established lobbying power. But it sends a clear message from NASA and the White House to budget writers in the House and Senate.

This award effectively says that NASA is serious about getting to the Moon with the funding it has. And if Congress were to fully fund the Human Landing System program, NASA could bring on a competitor. Ideally, of course, there should be competition. This approach has worked well for NASA's commercial cargo and crew programs. But NASA is getting a small fraction of what it needs to run a lunar lander competition.

In addition to this development award, NASA said it would soon move to procure ""recurring landing services"" from industry. This contract will be for operational missions to the lunar surface, and it seems like SpaceX would have a significant advantage in winning the award. However, there may be an opening here, if Congress provides more funding for the Human Landing System, for either Dynetics or the Blue Origin-led team to play a role in human landings.

Self-funding Starship

SpaceX has largely self-funded development of the large Starship vehicle for about five years, with the intent of using it to settle humans on Mars one day. Starship is a fully reusable upper stage that will launch atop the Super Heavy rocket. SpaceX is in various states of testing and developing both of these vehicles at its facility in South Texas.

As part of the Artemis Program, SpaceX has proposed launching a modified version of its Starship vehicle to lunar orbit. Shortly afterward, a crew of NASA astronauts would launch inside an Orion spacecraft on top of a Space Launch System rocket, both of which were developed by NASA. Orion would rendezvous with Starship in lunar orbit, board the vehicle, and go down to the surface. Starship would then lift off from the lunar surface and link back up with Orion, and the crew would come back to Earth in the smaller capsule.

Left unsaid is the reality that SpaceX is also planning to launch humans on Starship from Earth. It does not seem like all that much of a stretch to question the need for the much more costly Orion and Space Launch System rocket, when lunar crews could simply launch in a Starship into low-Earth orbit, undergo refueling there from another Starship, and then go to the Moon and back. But NASA knows that Congress—which is heavily invested in Orion and the SLS rocket, and their jobs across all 50 states—would not support a SpaceX-only program.

The choice of SpaceX was applauded by some industry officials on Friday. ""The selection of SpaceX as the sole-source developer of the Human Lander System is a sign of how far both the company and their relationship with NASA has come over the last ten-years,"" said Lori Garver, a deputy administrator for NASA under President Obama. ""SpaceX's involvement in Artemis is sure to elevate public interest and will hopefully lead to our soonest possible return to the Moon.""

For years, space industry leaders like Garver have advocated for NASA to increase support for commercial space companies that have sought to drive down the costs of spaceflight. After all, SpaceX's bid for the entirety of its Human Landing System, $2.9 billion, is about what NASA spends each year on the Space Launch System and associated ground systems development. Now, the space agency appears to be boldly embracing such a future.",1044,6292,11,59
0,reports-multiple-people-shot-at-indianapolis-fedex-facility,https://japantoday.com/category/world/reports-multiple-people-shot-at-indianapolis-fedex-facility,"Eight people were killed in a late-night shooting Thursday at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis, police said, adding that the shooter killed himself.

Several other people were injured when gunfire erupted at the facility near the Indianapolis International Airport, police spokesperson Genae Cook said.

At least four were hospitalized, including one person with critical injuries. Another two people were treated and released at the scene, she said. FedEx said people who worked for the company were among the dead.

A witness told WTHR-TV that he was working inside the building when he heard gunshots.

“I see a man come out with a rifle in his hand and he starts firing and he starts yellin’ stuff that I could not understand,” Levi Miller said. “What I ended up doing was ducking down to make sure he did not see me because I thought he would see me and he would shoot me.”

The shooter wasn't immediately identified, and investigators were in the process of conducting interviews and gathering information. Cook said it was too early to tell whether the shooter was an employee at the facility.

“We’re still trying to ascertain the exact reason and cause for this incident,” she said.

It was the latest in a recent string of mass shootings across the U.S. Last month, eight people were fatally shot at massage businesses across the Atlanta area, and 10 died in gunfire at a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado.

It was at least the third mass shooting this year in Indianapolis alone. Five people, including a pregnant woman, were shot and killed in January, and a man was accused of killing three adults and a child before abducting his daughter during at argument at a home in March.

“I am heartbroken by the mass shooting at the FedEx facility here in Indianapolis and praying for all affected by this tragedy,” Rep. Andre Carson, a Democrat whose district includes much of the city, tweeted.

Police were called to reports of gunfire Thursday just after 11 p.m., and officers “came in contact with (an) active shooter incident,” Cook said. The gunman later killed himself.

“The officers responded, they came in and did their job. A lot of them are trying to face this, because this is a sight that no one should have to see,” Cook said.

FedEx released a statement saying saying it is cooperating with authorities.

“We are deeply shocked and saddened by the loss of our team members following the tragic shooting at our FedEx Ground facility in Indianapolis,"" the statement said. ""Our most heartfelt sympathies are with all those affected by this senseless act of violence.”

Family members gathered at a nearby hotel to await word on loved ones. Some said employees aren’t allowed to have their phones with them while working shifts at the facility, making it difficult to contact them, WTHR-TV reported.

Ashlee Floyd told the Indianapolis Star that her father has worked at the facility for two decades. She said he usually calls his wife around 11:25 p.m. but he didn’t call Thursday, so family tried to contact him but he didn’t respond.

“I don’t know if he’s OK. I don’t know if he’s injured. I don’t know if he’s gone. I’m just scared right now,” she said.

Live video from news outlets at the scene showed crime scene tape in the parking lot outside the facility.

Jeremiah Miller, a witness who said he works at the facility, told WISH-TV that he saw a man with some kind of rifle after hearing several gunshots.

Another man told WTTV that his niece was sitting in the driver's seat of her car when the gunfire erupted, and she was wounded.

“She got shot on her left arm,” said Parminder Singh. “She's fine, she's in the hospital now.”

He said his niece did not know the shooter.

0,Gnome limits: UK garden centres run out after Suez blockage,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/apr/16/garden-gnomes-running-out-in-uk-as-garden-centres-business-booms,"Garden gnomes and other outdoor furniture are running out due to supply chain issues and the popularity of garden centres in the UK during lockdown.



Raw materials have become increasingly difficult to come by and the recent blockage of the Suez canal has also contributed to the national shortage of gnomes.

Ian Byrne, assistant manager of Highfield Garden World in Whitminster, Gloucestershire, said there had been a “massive upswing” in the sales of garden gnomes. “We haven’t seen a gnome in six months now, unfortunately,” he said.

Byrne said garden centres had experienced a “boom” and that was causing issues with the availability of many popular items.

He said: “There aren’t any [gnomes]. There’s definitely a shortage. It’s a combined thing with garden centres being so busy. I looked at some figures based on March which said garden centres were 97% busier than they were in 2019.

“Every day has been like a bank holiday. That’s good but it’s definitely causing some issues because it’s not just English garden centres that are booming, it’s all across Europe, so it’s causing issues with supply,” he said.

Like many garden centres, Byrne has been contacting suppliers across Europe and China to help ship garden gnomes to the UK.

He said: “Raw materials are becoming a bit of an issue and unfortunately gnomes are a victim of that shortage … Gnomes of any type – plastic, stone or concrete – are in short supply. They’ve been very popular over the last couple of seasons, we’ve seen a massive upswing in the sales of gnomes and definitely a different clientele wanting gnomes too.”



The Garden Centre Association’s chief executive, Iain Wylie, added: “Most garden centres haven’t noticed – although they will. We’re facing a perfect storm of lockdown, everyone being stuck at home, and one thing people can do is their gardening.”

Higher demand and confidence in supply chains have also caused issues. Plants, according to Wylie, have to be grown for a “just-in-time” market. “We are not immune to a ship getting stuck in a canal, freight cost issues due to Brexit, or the pandemic,” he said.



In the final three months of 2020, sales in DIY stores were up by 35% while garden centre sales were up by 8.5%, according to the Office for National Statistics.",395,2358,10,59

Those sentenced include the city’s so-called “father of democracy” Martin Lee as well as pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai.

They were found guilty earlier this month of organising and participating in a massive protest in August 2019, where an estimated 1.7 million people marched in opposition to a bill that would have allowed suspects to be extradited to mainland China for trial.

The protest was not authorised by the police.

Their convictions and sentencing were the latest blow to the city’s flagging democracy movement, amid an ongoing crackdown by Beijing and Hong Kong authorities on dissent in the semi-autonomous Chinese city.

Lee, an 82-year-old lawyer and former lawmaker known for his advocacy of human rights and democracy in the city, had his sentence of 11 months in prison suspended after his age was taken into consideration.

Lai, the founder of Hong Kong’s Apple Daily tabloid, was sentenced to 12 months in prison. Prior to sentencing, he was remanded in jail on other charges, including collusion with foreign forces to intervene in the city’s affairs — a new crime under a national security law imposed on the city in 2020 by the central government in Beijing.

Lee Cheuk-yan, a pro-democracy activist and former lawmaker known for helping to organise annual candlelight vigils in Hong Kong on the anniversary of the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square in 1989, was sentenced to 12 months in prison.

Lawyers Albert Ho and Margaret Ng both had their 12-month jail sentences suspended. Former lawmaker Leung Kwok-hung was sentenced to 18 months, while another former legislator, Cyd Ho, was given a jail sentence of eight months.

Two other former lawmakers, Au Nok-hin and Leung Yiu-chung, who previously pleaded guilty were also given jail sentences. Au was sentenced to 10 months in prison, while Leung’s eight-month jail term was suspended.

China's new political view of Hong Kong

Beijing had pledged to allow the city to retain civil liberties not permitted in mainland China for 50 years after the former British colony reverted to Chinese rule in 1997, but recently has ushered in a series of measures, including a national security legislation and electoral reforms, that many fear are a step closer to making Hong Kong no different from cities on the mainland.

Under the new rules, Hong Kong residents can be held legally liable for any speech opposing China's government and the ruling Communist Part or perceived colluding with hostile foreign political groups or individuals.",465,2901,9,59

While the Queen will not take part in the procession before the service, Prince Charles and his sister Princess Anne will follow a specially modified Land Rover, which will carry the Duke's coffin to the chapel. The journey is expected to take around eight minutes.

Their siblings, Edward and Andrew, will participate in the procession immediately behind them. William and Harry will come next though they will be separated from walking together by their cousin Peter Philips. And behind them will be the final family members, Anne's husband, Vice Admiral Tim Laurence, and the Earl of Snowdon.

Royals who are not involved in the procession such as the Duchess of Cornwall and Duchess of Cambridge will join the 94-year-old monarch to watch the funeral parade outside the chapel's Galilee Porch. This also includes blood relatives from the Duke's side who will be in attendance including Philip's great nephews, the Hereditary Prince of Baden and the Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg.

The decision for some royals to walk behind the coffin will inevitably draw comparisons to Princess Diana's funeral in 1997 when Charles, William and Harry participated in a similar procession alongside Prince Philip and Diana's brother Earl Spencer.

Saturday's memorial will be unlike any other recent royal funerals due to the coronavirus pandemic. The congregation will wear masks for the duration of the service, the palace spokesman said.

In line with the Duke's wishes, it will be a ceremonial funeral, rather than a state event, and all arrangements are set to take place within Windsor Castle without public engagement making sure to adhere to existing Covid measures.

In a break with tradition, members of the royal family will not be dressed in military uniform and instead don morning coats with medals or day dress, the spokesman added.

The subject of clothing emerged in recent days after some British media reported Prince Andrew wished to wear an admiral's uniform. Andrew stepped back from his royal duties in 2019 over his ties to disgraced financier and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein

The Duke of York joined the Royal Navy in 1979 as a Seaman Officer, sub-specializing as a pilot. He was promoted to the rank of vice-admiral in 2015 when he turned 55. He was due to be elevated to admiral upon his 60th birthday but that did not come to be in the wake of a disastrous interview with the BBC when he discussed his relationship with Epstein.

The decision against uniforms will also solve a dilemma facing the family as Prince Harry recently lost his honorary military titles when he chose to step down as a senior royal with his wife Meghan last March.

Harry was enlisted with the British Armed Forces for nearly a decade before ending his military service in 2015 . He served two tours in Afghanistan and achieved the rank of captain in 2011. He has also qualified as an Apache Aircraft commander.

During the service, a choir of four will sing music selected by Philip for the occasion. They will be seated in the nave, socially distanced from the assembled family members and close aides. One notable absence will be the lack of congregational singing which is currently prohibited by public health guidelines.

Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall view the flowers and messages of condolence left outside Buckingham Palace.

Following the service, the coffin will be lowered in the Royal Vault below the chapel as the choir sings the national anthem.

0,Angela Merkel receives Astrazeneca vaccine (German article),https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/corona-aktuell-merkel-impfung-astra-zeneca-1.5261743,"Bundespräsident Steinmeier hat in einer zentralen Gedenkveranstaltung an die Verstorbenen in der Corona-Krise erinnert. Die Pandemie sei über die Menschen hereingebrochen, sie habe Wunden geschlagen, Lücken gerissen. Und sie sei immer noch nicht vorbei.

Viele Menschen seien im vergangenen Jahr einen einsamen und oft qualvollen Tod gestorben. 80 000 Menschen seien es in Deutschland. Drei Millionen weltweit. Und ""Tag für Tag sterben weitere"". ""Auch in dieser Stunde ringen Menschen auf den Intensivstationen mit dem Tod"", betont Steinmeier im Konzerthaus am Gendarmenmarkt in Berlin.

Er warnt davor, das Leid der Corona-Pandemie zu verdrängen. Sein Eindruck sei, ""dass wir uns als Gesellschaft nicht oft genug bewusst machen, dass hinter all den Zahlen Schicksale, Menschen stehen"", sagt Steinmeier. ""Eine Gesellschaft, die dieses Leid verdrängt, wird als ganze Schaden nehmen.""

""Sie alle fehlen - in ihren Familien und Freundeskreisen, in der Nachbarschaft, im Kreis der Kollegen, in unserer Gesellschaft"", sagt der Bundespräsident. Sie alle kämen nicht zurück. ""Aber sie bleiben in unserer Erinnerung. Wir vergessen sie nicht.""

""Sterben in der Pandemie das war und das ist oft ein Sterben ohne Beistand und ohne Abschied"", sagt Steinmeier. Es zerreiße das Herz und mache ""unendlich traurig"", zu wissen, dass Menschen sterben mussten ""ohne ein letztes zärtliches Wort, einen letzten liebevollen Blick, einen letzten Händedruck"".

Der Bundespräsident erinnert aber auch an Ärzte und Pfleger, die Tag und Nacht um jedes Leben kämpften, auch an Seelsorger, an all jene, die ""bis zuletzt für Sterbende da sind, die versucht haben, ihnen trotz allem einen Abschied in Würde zu ermöglichen"". Nicht wenige hätten sich dabei selbst angesteckt, einige seien gestorben.

Steinmeier machte das Leid der Hinterbliebenen deutlich, die ihre Angehörigen vor deren Tod nicht beistehen konnten. ""Es gibt keine Worte für ihren Schmerz."" Er verstünde ihre Verzweiflung und ihre Bitterkeit, die sich vorwürfen, ihre Liebsten im Stich gelassen zu haben.

Das Virus habe die Gesellschaft tief erschüttert. ""Die Politik musste schwierige, manchmal tragische Entscheidungen treffen, um eine noch größere Katastrophe zu verhindern."" Steinmeier appelliert daran, über Schmerz, Leid und Wut zu sprechen, sich aber nicht in Schuldzuweisungen und im Blick zurück zu verlieren: ""Sammeln wir noch einmal die Kraft für den Weg nach vorn, den Weg heraus aus der Pandemie, den wir gehen wollen und gehen werden, wenn wir ihn gemeinsam gehen."" Die Pandemie, die zum Abstand zwinge, dürfe nicht auch noch die Gesellschaft auseinandertreiben.

Gedenk-Gottesdienst: ""Tod und Sterben sind uns näher gerückt als zuvor""

Am Vormittag fand zum Gedenken bereits ein ökumenischer Gottesdienst statt. Bei beiden Veranstaltungen ist die Zahl der Teilnehmer wegen der weiter angespannten Pandemielage stark begrenzt. Teilnehmen dürfen unter anderem fünf Menschen, die Angehörige verloren haben, sowie die Spitzen der fünf Verfassungsorgane - neben Steinmeier Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel, Bundestagspräsident Wolfgang Schäuble, Bundesratspräsident Reiner Haseloff (alle CDU) und der Präsident des Bundesverfassungsgerichts, Stephan Harbarth.

Den Auftakt zum zentralen Gedenken an die Corona-Toten bildet am Vormittag ein ökumenischer Gottesdienst in der Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedächtniskirche. Der Ratsvorsitzende der Evangelischen Kirche in Deutschland, Heinrich Bedford-Strohm, sagt in seiner Predigt, in der Corona-Pandemie hätten viele ein Gefühl der Schuld, die beim Tod ihrer Angehörigen nicht für diese hätten da sein dürfen. Sie fragten sich: ""Warum habe ich die Kontaktbeschränkung hingenommen, mir den letzten Kontakt verbieten lassen?"" Er erinnert daran, wie wichtig es gerade in Zeiten der Trauer sei, nicht allein zu sein. ""Es ist eine Kraft da in der Gemeinschaft der Trauernden.""

""Krankheit, Sterben und Tod lassen sich in diesem langen Jahr nicht wegdrücken, sie schneiden tief ein in das Leben vieler Menschen"", sagt der Vorsitzende der katholischen Deutschen Bischofskonferenz, Bischof Georg Bätzing, in seiner Predigt. ""Tod und Sterben sind uns näher gerückt als zuvor."" Dabei seien Abschiede oft holprig und überstürzt gewesen, und es fehle so viel. ""Was hier alles fehlt, was einem an Nähe und Zuneigung geraubt wird durch die Pandemie, das verwundet die Seele.""

Neben Bedford-Strohm und Bätzing kommen auch Vertreter anderer Kirchen und Gemeinden zu Wort. Auch einige speziell von der Pandemie Betroffene berichten von ihren Erfahrungen. So schildert Joachim Huber, ein Redakteur aus Berlin, seine eigene Corona-Erkrankung im März 2020. Er habe fünf Wochen im Koma gelegen. Seine Tochter und Frau hätten ihn währenddessen nicht besuchen dürfen. ""Ich habe überlebt"", sagt Huber. Doch während er dies sage, würden schon wieder neue Infizierte in die Krankenhäuser gebracht. ""Die Infizierten werden kämpfen müssen.""

Julian Leukert, Intensiv-Pfleger in der Berliner, Charité, betreut seit einem Jahr Corona-Patienten, wie er berichtet. ""Während man in den Nachrichten die Zahlen sieht, sehe ich die Menschen hinter den Zahlen"", sagt er. Er habe emotionale Momente erlebt, in denen Menschen ihren letzten Weg alleine gehen mussten. ""Wir sind keine Superhelden"", betont er. Doch noch nie habe ihm eine Herausforderung so viel Kraft abverlangt.

RKI: 19 185 Neuinfektionen und 67 neue Todesfälle

Die Gesundheitsämter in Deutschland haben dem Robert Koch-Institut (RKI) binnen eines Tages 19 185 Corona-Neuinfektionen gemeldet. Zudem wurden innerhalb von 24 Stunden 67 neue Todesfälle verzeichnet. Das geht aus Zahlen des RKI von Sonntagmorgen hervor, die den Stand des RKI-Dashboards von 05.40 Uhr wiedergeben. Nachträgliche Änderungen oder Ergänzungen des RKI sind möglich. Am Sonntag sind die vom RKI gemeldeten Fallzahlen meist niedriger, unter anderem weil am Wochenende weniger getestet wird. Am Sonntag vor einer Woche hatte das RKI binnen eines Tages 17 855 Neuinfektionen und 104 neue Todesfälle verzeichnet.

Die Zahl der binnen sieben Tagen gemeldeten Neuinfektionen pro 100 000 Einwohner lag laut RKI am Sonntagmorgen bundesweit bei 162,3. Am Vortag hatte das RKI diese Sieben-Tage-Inzidenz mit 160,7 angegeben, vor vier Wochen hatte sie noch bei 129,7 gelegen.

Der bundesweite Sieben-Tage-R-Wert lag nach dem RKI-Lagebericht von Samstagabend bei 1,22 (Vortag: 1,24). Das bedeutet, dass 100 Infizierte rechnerisch 122 weitere Menschen anstecken. ""Der Sieben-Tage-R-Wert liegt über 1. Dies bedeutet weiterhin eine Zunahme der Fallzahlen"", hieß es im Lagebericht. Der R-Wert bildet jeweils das Infektionsgeschehen vor 8 bis 16 Tagen ab. Liegt er für längere Zeit unter 1, flaut das Infektionsgeschehen ab; liegt er anhaltend darüber, steigen die Fallzahlen.

Das RKI zählte seit Beginn der Pandemie 3 142 262 nachgewiesene Infektionen mit Sars-CoV-2 in Deutschland. Die tatsächliche Gesamtzahl dürfte deutlich höher liegen, da viele Infektionen nicht erkannt werden. Die Zahl der Genesenen gab das RKI mit etwa 2 775 200 an. Die Gesamtzahl der Menschen, die an oder unter Beteiligung einer nachgewiesenen Infektion mit Sars-CoV-2 gestorben sind, stieg auf 79 914.

Altmaier mahnt konsequente Anwendung von Ausgangssperren an

Im Ringen um eine Verschärfung des Infektionsschutzgesetzes hat sich Bundeswirtschaftsminister Peter Altmaier für die umstrittenen Ausgangssperren-Pläne starkgemacht. ""Die Ausgangssperre ist ein Signal für die Dramatik der Lage und dafür, dass wir es ernst meinen - gerade weil es sie bisher in Deutschland kaum gab"", sagt der CDU-Politiker der Frankfurter Allgemeinen Sonntagszeitung. Es gehe nicht um den Spaziergänger mit Hund, sondern um die Einhaltung der Kontaktregeln.

""Überall auf der Welt, wo eine Infektionswelle erfolgreich gebrochen wurde, hat man das mit dem Instrument eines harten Lockdowns geschafft"", betont der Minister. ""Auf der sicheren Seite sind wir, wenn wir insgesamt die Zahl der sozialen Kontakte reduzieren - und die entstehen, wenn alles geöffnet ist."" Daran seien alle differenzierte Modelle wie in Tübingen oder Rostock gescheitert.

Der Präsident des Deutschen Landkreistages, Reinhard Sager, kritisierte hingegen die geplanten Ausgangsbeschränkungen. ""Diese wären in Ihrer Pauschalität ein unverhältnismäßiger Eingriff in die Freiheitsrechte der Menschen, weil dem kein überlegener Effekt zur Verhinderung von Neuinfektionen gegenübersteht"", sagte er den Zeitungen der Funke Mediengruppe (Online Sonntag, Print Montag).

Auch die SPD-Fraktion fordert eine Abkehr von den Plan. Fraktionschef Rolf Mützenich wiederholte in der Bild am Sonntag die Forderung seiner Fraktion, Abendspaziergänge grundsätzlich zu erlauben. ""Es muss möglich sein, dass sich Erwachsene auch trotz aller Beschränkungen die Beine vertreten."" Zudem sagte Mützenich: ""Kinder müssen in Kleinstgruppen Sport treiben können. Zumal wir von Experten wissen, dass das Ansteckungsrisiko draußen um ein Vielfaches geringer ist als in geschlossenen Räumen.""

Scholz wirbt für bundeseinheitliche Notbremse

Die Debatte über den Nutzen der geplanten bundeseinheitlichen Corona-Notbremse reißt nicht ab. Vizekanzler Olaf Scholz wirbt in der Welt am Sonntag erneut für die entsprechenden Neuerungen des Infektionsschutzgesetzes. Wichtig seien ihm klare, einheitliche und lebensnahe Regelungen: ""Für die privaten Kontakte, für das Einkaufen, für Ausgangsbeschränkungen, von deren Nutzen ich weiterhin überzeugt bin. Es muss für jede und jeden nachvollziehbar sein, was gilt.""

Mit dem Gesetz soll es künftig bundeseinheitliche Regelungen für Corona-Maßnahmen geben. Überschreitet die Zahl der Neuinfektionen auf 100 000 Einwohner binnen sieben Tagen in einer Stadt oder einem Landkreis den Wert von 100 an drei aufeinander folgenden Tagen, müssen etwa Geschäfte geschlossen werden und es greifen Ausgangsbeschränkungen zwischen 21.00 und 5.00 Uhr.

Über mögliche Änderungen am bisherigen Entwurf des Infektionsschutzgesetzes könnte der Gesundheitsausschuss am Montag befinden. Eine Verabschiedung im Bundestag ist für Mittwoch vorgesehen. Der Bundesrat will sich am Donnerstag damit befassen. Scholz sagte, sicherlich werde in den laufenden Beratungen des Bundestags an der einen oder anderen Stelle noch ein wenig gefeilt. ""Ich erwarte aber keine wesentlichen Änderungen gegenüber dem Entwurf.""

Genau das fordern aber unter anderem die deutschen Landkreise. ""Der Gesetzentwurf muss an vielen Stellen korrigiert werden"", sagte der Präsident des Deutschen Landkreistages, Reinhard Sager, den Zeitungen der Funke Mediengruppe (Online Sonntag, Print Montag). ""Die reine Anknüpfung an Inzidenzen wird dem Pandemiegeschehen nach mehr als einem Jahr und den regional sehr unterschiedlichen Situationen nicht gerecht.""

Brandenburg beschließt nächtliche Ausgangsbeschränkung

In Brandenburg soll ab Montag eine Ausgangsbeschränkung zwischen 22 Uhr und 5 Uhr für Regionen gelten, in denen die Sieben-Tage-Inzidenz mindestens drei Tage lang über 100 liegt. Ab 200 Corona-Neuinfektionen pro 100 000 Einwohner in einer Woche sollen in Landkreisen oder kreisfreien Städten alle Schulen mit Ausnahme der Abschlussklassen und die Kitas geschlossen werden, erklärte Ministerpräsident Dietmar Woidke (SPD) am Samstag.

Lauterbach beklagt Farbanschlag auf sein Auto

Auf das Auto des SPD-Gesundheitspolitikers Karl Lauterbach ist nach dessen Angaben ein Farbanschlag verübt worden. Gestern habe es seinen geliebten Stadtwagen erwischt, twitterte Lauterbach am Samstag. ""Farbeimer, er sieht schrecklich aus. Auch die Scheiben, ich kann ihn nicht mehr fahren."" Der Politiker und Arzt, der in der Corona-Krise stark in der Öffentlichkeit stehen und für strikte Maßnahmen zur Eindämmung der Virus-Pandemie eintritt, äußerte sich allerdings kämpferisch: ""Aber wir werden nie aufgeben. Wir sind viele...""

Unterstützung erhielt er von der stellvertretenden Bundesvorsitzenden der Grünen, Ricarda Lang. Sie twitterte in einer Reaktion unter den Lauterbach-Äußerungen: ""Gestern wurden unsere Namen auf dem Klingelschild unserer Privatwohnung rot durchgestrichen. Politiker*innen werden immer öfter bedroht und eingeschüchtert. Aber wir werden die Angst nicht gewinnen lassen.""

Unternehmen wollen Impfaktion in Deutschland beschleunigen

Große Teile der deutschen Wirtschaft sind davon überzeugt, die Impfaktion gegen das Coronavirus beschleunigen zu können. Zahlreiche Unternehmen signalisierten in den vergangenen Tagen ihre Bereitschaft, Mitarbeiter von Betriebsärzten spritzen zu lassen. Noch reicht der Impfstoff dafür aber nicht aus. Mehr als Pilotprojekte sind bisher nicht absehbar - und in den Impfzentren der Konzerne ist Geduld gefragt.

Allein beim Autozulieferer Continental könnten in Deutschland in den werksärztlichen Diensten täglich mehr als 1000 Mitarbeiter geimpft werden, wie der Dax-Konzern aus Hannover auf Anfrage mitteilte. ""Unsere Betriebsärzte stehen bereit"", sagte Personalsprecherin Nicole Göttlicher. ""Konkrete Informationen von den zuständigen Behörden, wann wir hier aktiv werden können, liegen derzeit noch nicht vor.""

Für einen schnelleren Fortschritt werden nach den regionalen Impfzentren inzwischen auch Arztpraxen mit Impfstoff beliefert. Auf die Forderung, auch Impfungen in Betrieben rasch voranzutreiben, hatte Bundesgesundheitsminister Jens Spahn zuletzt mehrmals auf den wenigen verfügbaren Impfstoff verwiesen. ""Noch ist es zu knapp"", sagte er Ende März. Die Betriebsärzte sollten nach Hausärzten in die Impfaktion einsteigen.

In dieser Woche griff Berlins Regierender Bürgermeister Michael Müller die Forderung auf und schlug Beratungen zwischen Bund und Ländern vor. ""Wir haben darüber zu sprechen, wie wir die Haus- und Betriebsärzte noch besser einbinden, um schneller zu werden."" Spahn hatte mit Blick auf die Rangfolge gesagt, er finde es schwierig, jüngere Mitarbeiter von Unternehmen zu impfen, solange die Älteren noch nicht geschützt seien.

Dennoch wird in einigen Konzernen davon ausgegangen, dass es bald soweit sein könnte. ""Wir möchten sofort beginnen zu impfen, sobald Werks- und Betriebsärzte in die Impfkampagne eingebunden werden"", sagt Markus Siebenmorgen vom Pharmakonzern Bayer in Leverkusen. ""Nach der neuesten Impfverordnung erwarten wir, dass dies in Kürze der Fall sein wird."" Das Interesse der Mitarbeiter sei hoch, und das Unternehmen wolle die Impfungen auch gern auf Fremdfirmen an den jeweiligen Standorten sowie auf Familienangehörige ausweiten.

Tobias Hans gegen Voll-Lockdown

Der saarländische Ministerpräsident Tobias Hans (CDU) hält die geplante Änderung des Infektionsschutzgesetzes mit bundesweiten Ausgangsbeschränkungen für eine Fehlentscheidung. ""Wenn wir jetzt erneut völlig unkreativ in einen weiteren Voll-Lockdown gehen, wird das zwar irgendetwas helfen"", sagte Hans einem Vorabbericht der Welt zufolge in einem Interview. ""Aber es wird auch für viel Verdruss sorgen."" Nach 14 Monaten in der Pandemie könne sich ein modernes Land wie Deutschland, das sich auf die Fahnen schreibe ""auch technologisch vorne zu sein, doch nicht auf alle Alternativen verzichten, auf Kontaktnachverfolgungen per App etwa oder regelmäßiges Testen mit Nachweisen, die digital geliefert werden können."" Hans fordert ein intelligentes Steuerungsmodell, um mit dieser Pandemie auch mittel- und langfristig umzugehen.

Kanzlerin mit Astra Zeneca geimpft

Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) hat am Freitag ihre erste Corona-Schutzimpfung erhalten. ""Ich freue mich, dass ich heute die Erstimpfung mit Astra Zeneca bekommen habe"", teilte Merkel über ihren Regierungssprecher Steffen Seibert per Twitter mit. Sie fügte hinzu: ""Ich danke allen, die sich in der Impfkampagne engagieren - und allen, die sich impfen lassen. Das Impfen ist der Schlüssel, um die Pandemie zu überwinden."" Die Kanzlerin ist 66 Jahre alt und fällt damit in die Gruppe jener, die in Deutschland für Astra-Zeneca-Impfungen infrage kommen.

Auch Vizekanzler Olaf Scholz (SPD) hat am Freitag seine Schutzimpfung bekommen. Er habe sich das Präparat von Astra Zeneca spritzen lassen, berichtete der Finanzminister auf Twitter. Zugleich dankte er dem Ärzteteam der Bundeswehr, das ihn impfte. Scholz ist 62 Jahre alt und durfte sich daher für eine Astra-Zeneca-Impfung anmelden. Auch andere Bundesminister sind bereits geimpft. ""Jede Impfung bringt uns dem Zeitpunkt näher, an dem wir diese Pandemie überwunden haben werden"", betonte Scholz bereits vor seinem Impftermin. Alle müssten ihren Beitrag leisten und Vorbild sein.

Das Vakzin von Astra Zeneca wird in Deutschland nur noch für die über 60-Jährigen empfohlen. Der Einsatz für Jüngere bleibt nach ärztlichem Ermessen bei Menschen ohne höheres Blutgerinnsel-Risiko freiwillig möglich. Merkel hatte immer betont, dass sie geimpft werden wolle, wenn sie nach der Priorisierung an der Reihe sei.

Brandenburg will Corona-Maßnahmen verschärfen

Brandenburg plant schärfere Corona-Maßnahmen ab kommender Woche. Das Kabinett habe in einer informellen Runde beschlossen, dass es ab Montag bei einer Sieben-Tage-Inzidenz ab 100 in Kreisen oder kreisfreien Städten eine Ausgangsbeschränkung von 22 Uhr bis 5 Uhr geben soll, wie Regierungssprecher Florian Engels mitteilte. Ab Mittwoch sollen Grundschulen schließen, falls der Wert 200 erreicht ist; an Kitas soll in diesem Fall eine Notbetreuung eingerichtet werden.

Bisher sind nur weiterführende Schulen im Distanzunterricht. Das Kabinett komme am Samstag zu einer Sondersitzung zusammen, kündigte Engels an. Die Schließung von Schulen und Kitas ab der Inzidenz 200 und eine Ausgangsbeschränkung sind auch in der Bundes-Notbremse geplant, letztere aber bereits ab 21Uhr.",2450,17580,7,59

Romania's centrist government on Thursday approved a United States-backed bill that effectively bars China and Huawei (HWT.UL) from taking part in development of its 5G network, a member of the IT&C and National Security Committee told Reuters.

Europe has emerged as a battleground in the technology 'Cold War' playing out between China and Washington and Huawei's European competitors, Ericsson (ERICb.ST) and Nokia (NOKIA.HE), could become a supplier duopoly should the Chinese company be shut out.

""The government just approved this bill of paramount importance for Romania, sealing a 2019 memorandum signed in Washington, meaning that China and Huawei are ruled out from any would-be partnership on 5G with the Romanian state,"" Pavel Popescu said.

Under the memorandum, the two governments said in August 2019 that: ""as part of risk-based security approach, careful and complete evaluation of 5G vendors is necessary.""

Romania was a staunch Washington ally even before it joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 2004. Washington sees Huawei as an arm of China's Communist Party's global surveillance machinery.

Huawei, which is playing a leading role as the telecoms world gears up for next generation wireless technology, has repeatedly denied spying for the Chinese state.

The bill approved on Thursday reflects the U.S. memorandum, and Romania's Supreme Defence Council stance. Popescu said: ""National security is a key goal, and protecting Romania's future generations' personal data is crucial.""

It says a vendor's evaluation should say whether a company is subject to control by a foreign government, has a transparent ownership structure, and is subject to a legal regime that enforces transparent corporate practices.

Popescu said the bill, which could be rubber-stamped in parliament in the next weeks, is a prerequiste to launching 5G tenders in the Black Sea state in second half of the year.

WINDSOR, England (AP) — Sitting by herself at the funeral of Prince Philip on Saturday, Queen Elizabeth cut a regal but solitary figure: still the monarch, but now alone.

The queen sat apart from family members at the simple but somber ceremony at Windsor Castle, in accordance with strict social distancing rules during the coronavirus pandemic. But if the ceremony had been for anyone else, at her side would have been her husband of 73 years, who gave a lifetime of service to the crown.

Wearing a face mask, the queen was dressed all in black, except for the diamond brooch that flashed on her left shoulder — a piece she had often worn on engagements with her husband.

The monarch’s four children — Prince Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward — sat nearby, as did the queen and Philip’s eight grandchildren. The stripped-back service made their loss somehow more personal for people who often live their lives in public.

Just 30 mourners were allowed to attend the service for the prince, who died April 9 at the age of 99. The entire royal procession and funeral took place out of public view within the grounds of the castle, a 950-year-old royal residence 20 miles (30 kilometers) west of London, but was shown live on television.

Hundreds of people lined the streets outside the castle to pay their respects to the prince. Some held Union flags and clutched flowers, while others wore custom face masks featuring the royal’s photo.

“We have been inspired by his unwavering loyalty to our queen, by his service to the nation and the Commonwealth, by his courage, fortitude and faith,” the dean of Windsor, David Conner, said in his call to prayer.

The nation honored Philip with a minute’s silence observed across the United Kingdom at 3 p.m., its beginning and end marked by a gun fired by the King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery. The final shot signaled the start of a funeral service steeped in military and royal tradition, but infused with the duke’s personality.

Philip’s body was carried to St. George’s Chapel at the castle on a Land Rover that the prince himself had specially designed. It was followed by members of the Royal Family, including Princes William and Harry, who made their first public appearance together since Harry and his wife, Meghan, gave a controversial interview to U.S. television host Oprah Winfrey in which they discussed the difficulties of royal life and how the two brothers had grown apart.

The procession traversed the grounds of Windsor Castle, passing military detachments arrayed under bright blue skies.

Inside the medieval Gothic chapel, the setting for centuries of royal weddings and funerals, this service was quiet and without excessive pageantry. Philip was deeply involved in planning the ceremony. At his request, there was no sermon. There were also no eulogies or readings, in keeping with royal tradition.

Former Bishop of London Richard Chartres, who knew Philip well, said the 50-minute service reflected the preferences of the prince, who was a man of faith but liked things to be succinct.

“He was at home with broad church, high church and low church, but what he really liked was short church,” Chartres told the BBC.

Philip’s coffin was draped with Philip’s personal standard, topped with his Admiral of the Fleet Naval Cap and sword. The sword was given to him by his father-in-law, King George VI, on the occasion of his marriage to the queen in 1947.

The monarch offered her own touches to the day. Ahead of the funeral, Buckingham Palace released a photo of the queen and Philip, smiling and relaxing on blankets in the grass in the Scottish Highlands in 2003. The palace said the casual, unposed photo was a favorite of the queen.

Composing a wreath atop the coffin were flowers chosen by the queen, including white lilies, small white roses, white freesia, white wax flower, white sweet peas and jasmine. A note from the monarch was attached, but its contents were not disclosed.

The funeral reflected Philip’s military ties, both as the ceremonial commander of many units and as a veteran of the Royal Navy who served with distinction during World War II. More than 700 military personnel took part in the commemorative events, including army bands, Royal Marine buglers and an honor guard drawn from across the armed forces.

Lt. Gen. Roland Walker, regimental lieutenant colonel of the Grenadier Guards, said his unit was honored to take part because of its close relationship with the prince. Philip served as regimental colonel of the guards, its honorary leader, for 42 years.

“This is a privilege,” he told the BBC. “Because my understanding is he planned this, so we’re here because he wanted us to be here, and that, I think, down to the junior guardsmen, is a known fact.”

William and Harry were part of the nine-member royal contingent, although their cousin, Peter Phillips, walked between them. There was no obvious tension between the brothers, whose relationship has been strained since Harry’s decision to quit royal duties and move to California. After the service, they walked back to the castle together, seeming to chat amiably.

Their appearance at the service stirred memories of the 1997 funeral of Princess Diana, when William and Harry, then 15 and 12, walked behind their mother’s coffin accompanied by Philip.

As Philip’s coffin was lowered into the Royal Vault, Royal Marine buglers sounded “Action Stations,” an alarm that alerts sailors to prepare for battle — included in the service at Philip’s request. He will rest there, at least until the queen’s death, alongside the remains of 24 other royals, including King George III, whose reign included the years of the American Revolution. The queen and Philip are expected to be buried together in the Royal Burial Ground on the Frogmore Estate close to Windsor Castle.

For decades, Philip was a fixture of British life, renowned for his founding of the Duke of Edinburgh’s Awards program that encouraged youths to challenge themselves and for a blunt-spoken manner that at times included downright offensive remarks. He lived in his wife’s shadow, but his death has sparked a reflection about his role, and new appreciation from many in Britain.

“To be perfectly honest I didn’t realize the extent (of) what his life had been, what he had done for us all,” said Viv Davies, who came to pay her respects in Windsor. “He was a marvelous husband, wasn’t he, to the queen and the children? Just remarkable — and I don’t think we will see the like again.”

NIAMEY, Niger -- Gunmen on motorcycles attacked a village near Niger's troubled border with Mali, shooting at people as they prayed at the mosque during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and killing 19 people, officials said Sunday.

The attack took place Saturday evening in the village of Gaigorou in Niger's Tillaberi region, which has come under repeated attack by suspected Islamic militants since January.

Niger's government called a “cowardly attack by people who claim to be Muslims,” and sent the interior and defense ministers to visit the wounded.

""The government will continue to fight the terrorists without weakness,” Defense Minister Alkassoum Indatou told residents in western Niger on Sunday.

Islamic extremists aligned with the Islamic State group have long been active in Niger, and suspicion quickly fell on the militants earlier this year after gunmen began staging a series of large-scale attacks on civilians near the Malian border.

It began with a January attack on two villages that killed at least 100 people. The following month 237 more were killed in a series of attacks at the hands of armed gunmen aboard motorcycles.

There have been no claims of responsibility for the wave of attacks.

Not only are jihadis active in the Tillaberi region, but the counterterrorism offensives against those extremists have helped give rise to ethnic militias, analysts say. Intercommunal tensions have been exacerbated as a result, particularly near the border between Mali and Niger.

The mounting violence poses a strong threat to Niger's newly inaugurated President Mohamed Bazoum. He was sworn into office earlier this month only days after security forces thwarted an attempted military coup at the presidential palace in the capital of Niamey.

REUTERS/John Sibley

The European Union said on Friday that Britain should not change trading rules in Northern Ireland on its own and that the bloc would continue its legal case over unilateral British action in the province for as long as necessary.

European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic, who hosted UK negotiator David Frost for talks on Thursday evening, said only agreements by joint bodies established by the Brexit divorce deal could provide stability in Northern Ireland.

The British-ruled province has remained in the EU single market for goods since Brexit to ensure an open border with EU member Ireland and so requires checks on goods coming from other parts of the United Kingdom.

Britain in March unilaterally extended a grace period on certain checks to minimise supply disruption, a move Brussels said breached the Brexit divorce deal known as the Withdrawal Agreement and the specific protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland. read more

Sefcovic said in a statement on Friday there was no space for unilateral action. He said both sides had to agree on how to comply fully with the protocol, including ""clear end-points, deadlines, milestones and the means to measure progress"".

Frost said the British government was committed to working through joint bodies and that all solutions had to respect the Good Friday peace agreement ""in all its dimensions"" and to ensure minimal disruption to everyday lives in Northern Ireland.

Both agreed that Thursday's discussion took place in a constructive atmosphere, that talks needed to intensify and that they would jointly engage with business groups, civil society and others in Northern Ireland.

Frost said some ""positive momentum"" had been established.

""But a number of difficult issues remained and it was important to continue to discuss them,"" the British government said in a statement.

NEW YORK (AP) — Safety regulators warned people with kids and pets Saturday to immediately stop using a treadmill made by Peloton after one child died and others were injured.

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said children and at least one pet were pulled, pinned and entrapped under the rear roller of the Tread+ treadmill, leading to fractures, scrapes and the death of one child.

The safety commission said in a news release and in emails that it knows of 39 “incidents” with the treadmill, involving “multiple” or “dozens” of children, but it did not specify a number of children. It said the majority of the incidents resulted in injuries, including the one death.

The commission posted a video on its YouTube page of a child being pulled under the treadmill.

Of the 39 incidents, 23 involved children, according to New York-based Peloton Interactive Inc.; 15 included objects like medicine balls, and one included a pet, it said.

Peloton said in a news release that the warning from the safety commission was “inaccurate and misleading.” It said there’s no reason to stop using the treadmill as long as children and pets are kept away from it at all times, it is turned off when not in use, and a safety key is removed.

But the safety commission said that in at least one episode, a child was pulled under the treadmill while a parent was running on it, suggesting it can be dangerous to children even while a parent is present.

If adults want to keep using the treadmill, the commission said, they should use it only in a locked room so children and pets can’t come near it. When not in use, the treadmill should be unplugged and the safety key taken out and hidden away. The commission also said to keep exercise balls and other objects away from it, because those have been pulled under the treadmill, too.

Peloton is best known for its stationary bikes, but it introduced the treadmill about three years ago and now calls it the Tread+. It costs more than $4,000.

Sales of Peloton equipment have soared during the pandemic as virus-weary people avoid gyms and workout at home instead. The company brought in $1 billion in revenue in the last three months of 2020, more than double its revenue from the same period a year before.

The commission did not say how many of the Peloton treadmills have been sold.

This story has been corrected to show that the Consumer Product Safety Commission said it recorded 39 incidents involving the treadmill, not nearly 40 children injured.

(AP Photo/Martin Mejia)

CHUGUR, Peru (AP) — As schools across Peru closed due to the coronavirus pandemic, Pedro Castillo tried to find a way to keep classes going for his 20 fifth- and sixth-grade students. But in his impoverished rural community deep in the Andes, his efforts were futile.

Seventeen of the students didn’t even have access to a cellphone. Tablets promised by the government never arrived.

“I called my students who have a basic cellphone, and the father answers you from the farm. You cannot connect with the child,” he said. “You call again in the afternoon or evening. The children don’t answer because they are exhausted in bed.”

ADVERTISEMENT

“Where is the state?” Castillo, 51, told The Associated Press after a day of planting sweet potatoes on his own land.

It was the last straw for Castillo, who over 25 years had seen his students struggle in crumbling schools where teachers also cook, sweep floors and file paperwork. He’d already dabbled in activism with the local teachers’ union and helped lead a national strike in 2017. But now he went further, tossing his name into a crowd of 18 candidates in Peru’s presidential election.

Defying the polls, the elementary school teacher came first in the April 11 voting , albeit with less than 20% of the overall vote. The stunning result gave him a place in June’s presidential runoff against Keiko Fujimori, one of Peru’s most established political figures and the daughter of former president Alberto Fujimori. It is her third attempt to become president.

Castillo’s unlikely campaign comes at a turbulent time for the South American nation that has suffered like few others from the COVID-19 pandemic. It recently ran through three presidents in a week after one was removed by congress over corruption allegations. Every president of the past 36 years has been ensnared in corruption allegations, some imprisoned. One died by suicide before police could arrest him.

Fujimori herself has been imprisoned as part of a graft investigation though she was later released. And her father Alberto, who governed between 1990 and 2000, is serving a 25-year sentence for corruption and the killings of 25 people. She has promised to free him should she win.

The two candidates have had dramatically different lives.

While Fujimori’s father himself was a political outsider when he won office, his daughter grew up in the halls of power. She attended Boston University and got a master’s from Columbia University in the United States. She later served as first lady during her father’s last six years in office.

ADVERTISEMENT

Castillo is the son of illiterate peasants, the third of nine children. While he went on to complete a degree in educational psychology at Peru’s César Vallejo University, he still lives in the country’s third poorest district, his home surrounded by cypress trees, cornfields, pigs and cows.

He wears ponchos, straw hats and sandals made from leftover tires. When he walks through rural areas, people run to shake his hand.

“He is my neighbor, he is good people, he talks to us wherever he is,” said Emelina Medina, 70, who was shucking corn at her home a few blocks from Castillo’s house.

He also made a favorable impression on 31-year-old Elizabeth Altamirano, though she said she doesn’t know him personally.

“He is in favor of the countryside. We have not finished primary school, we have not had the ability to eat good food,” she said. “He is a peasant, a teacher. Politicians have only come to the (presidential) palace to profit, while we live in misery.”

Castillo’s politics mingle a nationalist, agrarian leftism with socially conservative impulses. He is Catholic and his wife, Lilia Paredes, a rural teacher like him, and his two children are evangelical. He has expressed opposition to same-sex marriage and has said that for him abortion and LGBT issues “are not a priority.”

He has proposed nationalizing mining, oil and energy sectors as well as deporting all immigrants living in the country illegally who commit crimes, a move aimed largely at the wave of Venezuelans who have sought refuge from their country’s crisis.

His chances of enacting his policies are uncertain. He would face a deeply divided unicameral congress that was newly elected on April 11. At the moment, his party has 37 of the 130 seats though the electoral counting to determine how many seats each party gets has not yet concluded.

It is also very much up in the air his chance of winning the June runoff against Fujimori. He received roughly 19% support in the first round of voting and she about 13%, leaving a vast sector of the electorate that supported neither.

His proposals to nationalize broad sectors of the economy have alarmed many in Peru, including business interests.

Peruvian Nobel Prize laureate for literature Mario Vargas Llosa, a longtime critic of Keiko Fujimori and her father, in a column published Saturday in the newspaper El País, warned that if Castillo wins in June, Peru will become like crisis-wracked Venezuela.

“It is an unprecedented danger, the daughter of pure ignorance,” wrote Vargas Llosa, who lost Peru’s 1990 presidential election to Alberto Fujimori. He urged people to support Keiko Fujimori as “the lesser evil.”

Whoever wins the runoff will have to cope with the economic hammer-blow of the pandemic, which prompted a lockdown of more than 100 days that left about 7 million people unemployed.

The country has recorded more than 1.6 million confirmed cases and over 56,400 deaths from COVID, and rising death counts recently forced the return of lockdowns.

According to data collected by Johns Hopkins University, only 1.48% of the population has been fully vaccinated, undermining hopes for a quick recovery from the pandemic.

Unlike former Bolivian President Evo Morales - an Indigenous former coca growers’ union leader to whom he has been compared - Castillo has held no public office before this run for the presidency. Morales held a seat in Bolivia’s Chamber of Deputies before becoming president.

Castillo’s lone “political post” was leading the 55-day teachers’ strike for better pay. He was an active rural teacher until 2020. Even with the campaign entering a critical phase, Castillo has continued to work on his farm in Chugur, hundreds of miles north of Lima, the capital.

“When you go out to ask for rights, they say that you are a terrorist,” said Castillo, apparently referring to unsupported allegations by some Peruvian media outlets that has ties to the country’s Maoist Shining Path rebel group.

“I know the country and they will not be able to shut me up,” he said. “The terrorists are hunger and misery, abandonment, inequality, injustice.”

0,Vietnam calls for faster vaccine rollout before shots expire,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/04/17/asia-pacific/vietnam-vaccine-expire/,"Vietnam’s health ministry called for the acceleration of its COVID-19 vaccine rollout on Friday as the expiry date of the Southeast Asian country’s first batch of jabs supplied through the COVAX program fast approaches.

Since it began its vaccination program last month, Vietnam has inoculated around 73,000 people despite receiving nearly 1 million AstraZeneca doses, 800,000 of which were obtained via the COVAX vaccine-sharing program.

“The (AstraZeneca) COVID-19 vaccine has a shelf life of 6 months but the batch delivered to Vietnam on April 1 under the COVAX scheme only has two months left till expiration,” the ministry said in a statement Friday.

“We have to speed up the inoculation. It is not acceptable that a single dose of the vaccine is thrown out because of a failure in the rollout,” the statement added.

The health ministry requested all 19 localities which have started vaccine programs to finish no later than May 5, 26 days before the vaccines expire.

Vietnam has been praised globally for its record containing the virus through targeted mass testing and a strict, centralized quarantine program.

The country has kept its tally of cases to 2,800, and reported only 35 deaths since the pandemic began. Authorities are aiming to immunize 70% of Vietnam’s population and are seeking to obtain a total of 150 million vaccine doses through direct purchases and via COVAX.

The health ministry said Vietnam had carried out its vaccination campaign at a higher safety level than the World Health Organization’s recommendation but that safety should not be the reason for a slow vaccine rollout.

The ministry did not immediately respond to emailed questions from Reuters regarding the slow progress of the program.

Four Vietnamese companies are engaged in vaccine research and production, two of which are at the human trial stage.

The EU, which aims to support Britain and the United States in upholding human rights in Hong Kong, was due to make its statement on Monday at a meeting of EU foreign ministers, but failed to win the necessary agreement from all 27 EU states.

""Hungary's argument was that the EU already has too many issues with China,"" a senior EU diplomat told Reuters. A second senior diplomat confirmed the blockage and Hungary's position. An EU official said the statement had been withdrawn from the EU's approval process.

China and the EU imposed tit-for-tat sanctions over Western accusations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang on March 22.

Hungarian diplomats in Brussels were not immediately available for comment. Budapest reluctantly supported the EU sanctions last month, calling them ""pointless"", and hosted China's defence minister for an official visit days after the EU sanctions decision.

Hungary is a large recipient of Chinese investment. In the past both Hungary and Greece, where China's COSCO Shipping has a majority stake in Greece's largest port, have blocked EU statements on China.

Beijing's top representative in Hong Kong this week warned foreign powers that they would be taught a lesson if they tried to interfere in China's management of the global financial hub, as tensions escalated between China and Western governments over the city. read more

The West says the new Hong Kong security law breaks a promise to maintain a high degree of autonomy for the city since its 1997 return to Chinese rule. China's supporters say the law has restored order following mass anti-government and anti-China protests in 2019.

The impasse is the latest blow to the EU's credentials as a defender of human rights, one of the diplomats said, and raises questions about the economically powerful EU's ""soft power"" that relies on inspiring countries to follow its example by outlawing the death penalty and upholding press freedoms.

It also underscores the EU's challenge in balancing business ties with China, its second-largest trade partner, and its ability to speak out against Chinese government crackdowns in Hong Kong, on human rights lawyers since 2015 and on Muslim Uighurs in northwestern China.

0,Kremlin to Expel 10 US Diplomats in Response to US Sanctions,https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2021-04-16/kremlin-ponders-next-moves-after-being-hit-by-us-sanctions,"By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV, Associated Press

MOSCOW (AP) — Russia on Friday responded to a barrage of new U.S. sanctions by saying it would expel 10 U.S. diplomats and take other retaliatory moves in a tense showdown with Washington.

The Russian Foreign Ministry also published a list of eight current or former U.S. officials barred from entering the country, including U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, FBI Director Christopher Wray, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas.

Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also said Moscow will move to shut down those U.S. nongovernment organizations that remain in Russia to end what he described as their meddling in Russia’s politics.

The top Russian diplomat said the Kremlin suggested that U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan follow the example of his Russian counterpart and head home for consultations. Russia will also deny the U.S. Embassy the possibility of hiring personnel from Russia and third countries as support staff, limit visits by U.S. diplomats serving short-term stints at the embassy, and tighten requirements for U.S. diplomats' travel in the country.

The others banned from entering Russia are Susan Rice, a former U.N. ambassador and now head of the Domestic Policy Council; John Bolton, who was a national security adviser under former President Donald Trump; James Woolsey, a former CIA director; and Michael Carvajal, director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

On Thursday, the Biden administration announced sanctions on Russia for interfering in the 2020 U.S. presidential election and involvement in the SolarWind hack of federal agencies — activities Moscow has denied. The U.S. ordered 10 Russian diplomats expelled, targeted dozens of companies and people, and imposed new curbs on Russia’s ability to borrow money.

While the U.S. wields the power to cripple Russia's economy, Moscow lacks levers to respond in kind, although it could hurt American interests in other ways globally.

Lavrov called Washington’s move “absolutely unfriendly and unprovoked,"" and he said that while Russia could take “painful measures” against American business interests in Russia, it wouldn’t immediately move to do that and “save them for future use.”

He warned that if Washington further raises the pressure, Russia might ask the U.S. to reduce the number of its embassy and consular staff from about 450 to 300. He said both countries host about 450 diplomats, but that includes some 150 Russians at the U.N. in New York that he argued shouldn't be included.

Russia's economic potential and its global reach are limited compared with the Soviet Union that competed with the U.S for international influence during the Cold War. Still, Russia's nuclear arsenal and its leverage in many parts of the world make it a power that Washington needs to reckon with.

Aware of that, President Joe Biden called for de-escalating tensions and held the door open for cooperation with Russia in certain areas. Biden said he told Putin in Tuesday's call that he chose not to impose tougher sanctions for now and proposed to meet in a third country in the summer.

Lavrov said Russia had a “positive attitude” to the summit offer and was analyzing it, but a statement issued by the Foreign Ministry shortly after noted that it ”was being studied in the context of the evolving situation.""

The ministry charged that Russia would like to avoid further escalation and engage in a “calm and professional dialogue,” but has other means to retaliate if Washington tries to crank up the pressure.

While the new U.S. sanctions further limited Russia’s ability to borrow money by banning U.S. financial institutions from buying Russian government bonds directly from state institutions, they didn't target the secondary market.

“It’s very important that there’re no sanctions on secondary debt because that means that non-U.S. persons can buy the debt and sell it to the U.S. persons,” said Tom Adshead, director of research at Macro-Advisory Ltd, an analytics and advisory company.

Timothy Frye, a Columbia University political scientist, noted that Biden chose not to target the prospective Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline to Germany or go after large Russian state-controlled companies.

""That’s part of the broader strategy of using sanctions but also reaching out to the Kremlin to propose talks on strategic stability and eventually on a summit,” he said.

Tougher restrictions would also hurt Western businesses, inflict significant economic pain on ordinary Russians and allow Putin to rally anti-U.S. sentiments to shore up his rule.

Ramping up sanctions could eventually drive Russia into a corner and provoke even more reckless Kremlin action, leading to a potential escalation in Ukraine, which has seen a surge in clashes with Russia-backed separatists in the east and a massive Russian troop buildup across the border.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was in Paris on Friday to discuss the tensions with French President Emmanuel Macron. After a joint call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the three urged Russia to pull back its troops to de-escalate the situation.

Fyodor Lukyanov, a top foreign policy expert who leads the Moscow-based Council for Foreign and Defense Policies, predicted Putin would likely accept Biden's invitation to join next week’s call on climate change but could drag his feet on the summit offer.

“There is no way to make any deals,” Lukyanov said. “There is a mutual antipathy and a total lack of trust.”

He said the only practical outcome of the summit could be an agreement to launch long and difficult talks on a replacement to the New START nuclear reduction agreement that Russia and the U.S. extended in February for another five years.

Lukyanov noted that the growing U.S. pressure will push Russia and China closer in the long run.

“Closer cooperation with China on coordinating actions to contain the United States will develop more quickly now as the Chinese are interested in that,” he said. While Russia lacks tools for a symmetrical answer to the U.S. sanctions, “it has ample capabilities to stimulate changes in the world order,” he added.

Konstantin Kosachev, the Kremlin-connected deputy speaker of the upper house of parliament, said that by imposing sanctions and proposing a summit at the same time, the U.S. sought to take a commanding stance.

“Russia's consent would be interpreted as a reflection of its desire to soften the sanctions, allowing the U.S. to secure a dominant position at the meeting, while our refusal to meet would be a convenient pretext for more punitive measures,"" Kosachev wrote on Facebook.

He argued that Russia should not rush to accept Biden's summit offer.

“Revenge is a dish best served cold,” Kosachev wrote. “I believe the saying is quite adaptable to a situation when we talk not about revenge but a due answer to aggressive action by an opponent.”

Some predicted the U.S. sanctions could discourage Russia from cooperating with the U.S. on international crises.

“The Russian position will grow tougher on Syria, the Iranian nuclear deal and other issues,” Ivan Timofeev, program director at Russian International Affairs Council, said in a commentary. Instead of acting as a deterrent, he warned, the sanctions would “only anger Russia and make its policy even tougher.”

But despite the soaring tensions, Russia and the U.S. have shared interests in many global hot spots. For example, Moscow fears that instability could spread from Afghanistan to former Soviet republics in Central Asia, and it is interested in a political settlement there.

As for Iran, Moscow also doesn't want to see it with nuclear weapons, despite its friendly ties with Tehran.

Lukyanov said Russia wouldn't try to use global hot spots to hurt the U.S. and would wait patiently to see them erode U.S. domination.

“It's not a matter of playing the spoiler here or there,” he said. “The ongoing developments will help accelerate the process of consolidation of leading powers against the U.S. domination.”

0,Analysis: Why is Beijing hounding Jack Ma and Alibaba again?,https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/China-up-close/Analysis-Why-is-Beijing-hounding-Jack-Ma-and-Alibaba-again,"Katsuji Nakazawa is a Tokyo-based senior staff writer and editorial writer at Nikkei. He spent seven years in China as a correspondent and later as China bureau chief. He is the 2014 recipient of the Vaughn-Ueda International Journalist prize for international reporting.

TOKYO -- Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding is in the news again.

On Monday evening, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported that four government agencies had carried out ""joint regulatory talks"" with Alibaba affiliate Ant Group. The four were the People's Bank of China, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange.

One noteworthy aspect is how the questioning was explained.

Xinhua reported that Pan Gongsheng, one of the central bank's deputy governors, answered questions from reporters on behalf of the four departments.

Q: What was the reason financial authorities questioned Ant Group again?

A: The Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central Economic Work Conference and the Ninth Meeting of the Central Finance and Economics Committee clearly stated that it is necessary to strengthen anti-monopoly and prevent the disorderly expansion of capital, and effectively prevent risks.

Chinese regulators' latest interest in Alibaba and Jack Ma has its roots in what was decided in October 2020 at the fifth plenary session of the 19th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. © Xinhua/Kyodo

It was the new slogan that the party has been pushing since October -- curbing market monopolies and preventing the disorderly expansion of capital -- and not existing law that was cited first.

The key point here is that Alibaba founder Jack Ma Yun and Ant Group, which Ma controls, are not under fire for any new mistakes. Instead, it is the party leadership's significant shift that is the cause of the questioning.

Past acts that used to be tolerated no longer are.

The latest question session signals that President Xi Jinping is extending the tactics he used in his signature anti-corruption campaign to private companies.

The need to eliminate corruption had always been talked about in the party. But it was usually just that: talk.

Xi was different because he took a decision made by the party and used it as a banner to more strictly enforce existing rules. With those rules, he cracked down on influential political foes, even those in China's highest echelon.

On Saturday, a long-dormant anti-monopoly law was suddenly and strictly applied in the form of a record $2.8 billion fine on Alibaba, equivalent to 4% of Alibaba's domestic sales in 2019.

Ant, Alibaba's financial arm best known for its smartphone-based Alipay electronic payment service, was forced by regulators to delay its dual listing in Shanghai and Hong Kong in early November, sending shock waves through global markets.

During the talks on Monday, the four regulatory bodies told Ant to transfer all financial operations, including the Alipay service, to a new financial holding company to be set up later and to subject them to strict monitoring and supervision by authorities.

This is the third time in less than six months that Chinese regulators have held regulatory talks with Ant executives.

Ma and Ant executives were first questioned early in November, when Ant's plan to raise more than $34 billion in the world's largest initial public offering was blocked at the last minute.

In December, Ant executives were questioned again. What has been unusual is how public each of the announcements has been.

Alibaba Chairman and CEO Daniel Zhang Yong on Monday rejected the idea that the latest penalty would have a ""material"" negative impact on the company's operations.

But sources suspect some political issues might be involved.

In China, where the party holds all the levers, the act of questioning a company's top executives hints at an unfavorable destiny. Questioned twice, and then a third time?

The $2.8 billion question is why the leadership shifted its stance.

One natural assumption would be the approach of the party's next national congress, in 2022, where Xi is expected to extend his reign.

Thanks to the fierce anti-corruption campaign, now in its eighth year, Xi has cemented his political standing within the party. But he has yet to tighten his grip on the business community.

If Xi were feeling uneasy about the private sector, one trauma could be what happened in Shanghai in the summer of 2015.

A stock market panic sent the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index tumbling 8%. To deal with the emergency, the leadership deployed senior public security officials for price-keeping operations.

A team of investigators led by the then-vice minister for public security (police) entered the building of the China Securities Regulatory Commission in Beijing's financial district and declared a strict joint crackdown on malicious short selling.

The team then flew to Shanghai, China's economic center, and began to investigate individual trading companies and others on suspicion of illegally manipulating stock prices.

The presence of the police signaled that the Xi leadership team detected a whiff of politics behind the whole affair.

That leadership team is now pressing private companies to get off the fence, show the flag and support Xi's political agenda, as it did to party members earlier in the anti-corruption campaign.

Jack Ma has always tried to maintain a certain distance. When he delivered a speech in Shanghai in October, Ma expressed his opposition to financial authorities' policies. He specifically said the country's old financial regulations were a drag on technological innovation.

Ma has had strong connections to China's ""princelings,"" the children of party leaders; ""second-generation reds,"" a smaller group of children whose parents joined the revolution before the 1949 establishment of the People's Republic; and guan er dai, children of government officials.

Xi himself is a second-generation red, being the son of former Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun. Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang, where Alibaba is headquartered, is a scenic city where Xi spent many years as the top provincial official.

But there is clearly a gap between Xi and Ma, partly due to their personal connections.

Alibaba's rapid growth was supported by Chinese leaders before Xi took the helm. Ma had particularly strong connections to the ""Shanghai faction,"" a group of people close to former President Jiang Zemin.

The Shanghai faction is also called the ""machine-building industry faction."" Jiang was originally an engineer for the First Ministry of Machine-Building Industry and at a plant of the FAW Group, a state-owned automaker headquartered in Changchun, Jilin Province.

For years, the Shanghai faction strongly influenced the industrial sphere. But with Xi having rapidly concentrated power, forces that are not close to Xi have had their political influence significantly eroded.

Their economic and financial influence is another matter. Children, grandchildren and other relatives of party elders retain a certain voice, and it is said that people close to princelings have significant Ant shareholdings.

But as Xi aims to extend his reign, he needs to take control of the economic realm, as he has done with the political domain.

Ma sensed the dangerous nature of the Xi era early on and decided to retire from the front line of running Alibaba despite being relatively young. He now appears in public much less frequently than he used to.

There are concerns about Ma's future. ""Even if he is safe now,"" one pundit said, ""there is no guarantee that he will remain so in the future.""

Many influential business leaders have suddenly been sent to prison over the past eight years. Among them is Wu Xiaohui, the top official of Anbang Insurance Group, a private insurer that grew rapidly into the third-biggest player in China.

Wu was detained shortly before the party's national congress in 2017. He was eventually sentenced to 18 years behind bars. Like Ma, Wu is a Zhejiang-born entrepreneur, one who had remarried the granddaughter of former Chinese supreme leader Deng Xiaoping.

As Wu's case clearly shows, connections to princelings or second-generation reds do not necessarily guarantee safety in the Xi era.",1444,9098,10,60

India has recorded 10 lakh new cases in six days.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi this morning appealed in a tweet that the mega Kumbh Mela should ""now only be symbolic"". The gathering of tens of thousands of pilgrims and fears of violation of Covid protocols along the banks of Ganga has sparked nationwide concern.

Maharashtra and Delhi saw the highest-ever surge in infections in the last 24 hours. With 63,729 new infections, Maharashtra's caseload is past the 37-lakh mark now. Delhi, which has surpassed Mumbai, has recorded over 8 lakh cases since the start of the pandemic; 19,486 cases were recorded in the last 24 hours.

Grim scenes from hospitals running out of oxygen supply and crematoriums struggling to keep up have caused worry as authorities scramble to break the chain of transmission amid the fast-growing second wave.

The alarming surge in cases is being reported as states continue to report vaccine shortage. Over 12 crore doses of vaccines have been administered so far, according to the Health Ministry data. Yesterday, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, stressing that ""vaccine stocks have completely run out"".

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday held a high-level meet about the efforts being made by the government to import medical grade oxygen to bridge the demand-supply gap.

The government on Friday evening issued its third emergency order in 24 hours to ensure the uninterrupted supply of cylinders across state borders, and to allow manufacturers and suppliers to serve hospitals across India. Earlier this month, the government had insisted there's no shortage of medical oxygen.

Weekend restrictions are back in Delhi, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh among other states. Maharashtra, earlier this week, announced tough restrictions for 15 days.

0,German Hospitals Near Breaking Point With Cases Still Rising,https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/german-hospitals-near-breaking-point-with-cases-still-rising/ar-BB1fG2Xm?ocid=uxbndlbing,"(Bloomberg) -- Germany’s health-care system is getting stretched to the brink, with many hospitals overwhelmed with Covid-19 patients and rising case numbers pointing to tougher days ahead.

The occupancy rate in intensive-care units rose to 88% on Wednesday, the highest in more than a year, and remained near that level on Thursday.

Some hospitals need to “significantly reduce” elective procedures and relocate stable patients to other parts of the country to cope, said Lothar Wieler, head of Germany’s Robert Koch Institute public health agency.

“The situation is getting dramatically worse,” Wieler said at a press conference as Germany reported 31,117 new coronavirus cases, the most since mid-January.

Only about 17% of the country’s population has received at least one Covid shot, and it could be months before a majority gets vaccinated. Meanwhile, the more transmissible virus variant that was first identified in the U.K. now accounts for about 90% of new cases, according to Wieler.

The group getting hit hardest is aged 15 to 49, although case numbers are even climbing again in people over 90 years old, Wieler said.

The situation in hospitals is particularly bad in places because there aren’t enough doctors and nurses, he said.

“I appeal once more on all decision-makers: we need a drastic reduction in contacts now,” Wieler said. Only then should policymakers figure out how to safely reopen parts of the economy, he said.

Wieler also pointed out that perhaps as many as 10% of patients will suffer months-long effects, also requiring more medical attention.

He likened the state of the pandemic in Germany to driving along a narrow, twisting mountain road with a steep cliff to one side. Driving too fast -- rather than moving along at a prudent pace -- heightens the risk of careening into the precipice, he said.

“It’s life threatening,” Wieler said. “Honestly, no emergency brake can help you anymore.”

The 2017 event drew global attention after the supposedly luxury music experience, promoted by supermodels and set to feature artists such as Major Lazer and Migos, turned out to resemble a disaster relief camp with windswept tents and decidedly non-gourmet food. Attendees had spent between $1,000 and $12,000 on tickets to the festival, which was cancelled on its opening day.

Organiser Billy McFarland apologised and said he was “committed to, and working actively to, find a way to make this right”. Numerous lawsuits were filed against him and his co-organiser, the rapper Ja Rule, and McFarland was arrested in June 2017. He pleaded guilty to numerous fraud charges relating to the festival and his company NYC VIP Access, which sold fake tickets to events such as the Met Gala. He was sentenced to six years in prison in October 2018. Ja Rule was cleared of wrongdoing a year later.

The latest lawsuit ruling, at the US bankruptcy court in New York, is still subject to a vote of approval, which will take place on 13 May, and there remains the chance that the the payout figure could be lower depending on Fyre’s bankruptcy case with other creditors.

In 2018, a judge ruled in favour of attendees Seth Crossno and Mark Thompson in another lawsuit against the festival, awarding the pair $5m in damages.",251,1486,9,60

NEW DELHI (AP) — India’s two largest cities imposed stringent restrictions on movement and one planned to use hotels and banquet halls to treat coronavirus patients as new infections in the country shot past 200,000 Thursday amid a devastating surge that is straining a fragile health system.

The soaring cases and deaths come just months after India thought it had seen the worst of the pandemic — and have forced the country to delay exports of vaccines abroad. India is a major producer of COVID-19 shots, and its pivot to focus on domestic demand has weighed heavily on global efforts to end the pandemic.

New Delhi announced stay-at-home orders for the weekend, though essential workers will be able to move about if they have a pass from local authorities. Restaurants, malls, gyms and spas will be shut down. Movie theaters will close on weekends, but can operate on weekdays at a third of their capacity.

Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi’s top elected official, said that despite rise in infections, 5,000 hospital beds are still available in the capital and more capacity is being added. But still, more than a dozen hotels and wedding banquet halls were ordered to be converted into COVID-19 centers where doctors from nearby hospitals will treat the moderately ill.

“The surge is alarming,” said S.K. Sarin, a government health expert in New Delhi.

The moves in the capital came after similar measures were imposed in the worst-hit state of Maharashtra, home to financial capital, Mumbai. The bustle of India’s biggest city ebbed after authorities closed most industries, businesses and public places Wednesday night and put limits on the movement of people for 15 days. Train and plane travel was still allowed, however.

In recent days, the city has seen an exodus of panic-stricken day laborers, hauling backpacks and flocking to overcrowded trains.

Dozens of other towns and cities have also imposed nighttime curfews.

The surge in cases was weighing on hospitals in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and several other states, where many reported a shortage of oxygen tanks. Imran Sheikh, a resident of the city of Pune in Maharashtra, said he was asked to supply his own oxygen tank for a relative undergoing COVID-19 treatment.

Cremation and burial grounds in the worst-hit areas were finding it difficult to cope with the increasing number of bodies arriving for last rites, according to Indian media reports.

Shahid Jamil, a virologist, said the recent local and state elections with massive political rallies and a major Hindu festival during which hundreds of thousands of devotees bathed in the Ganges river were super-spreader events.

The 200,739 new infections recorded Thursday are about twice the number of daily cases that were recorded during the last peak, in September. The Health Ministry also reported 1,038 deaths from COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, pushing the toll over 173,000.

As it struggles with the caseload, India is ramping up its vaccination drive. The Health Ministry said the total vaccinations crossed 114 million with more than 3 million doses administered on Wednesday.

When infections began plummeting in India in September, many concluded the worst had passed. Masks and social distancing were abandoned. When cases began rising again in February, authorities were left scrambling.",716,4433,11,60

MOSCOW (AP) — Associates of imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny called Sunday for massive protests in the heart of Moscow and St. Petersburg on Wednesday, saying Navalny’s health is deteriorating severely during a hunger strike.

Leonid Volkov, a top strategist for Navalny, said the demonstrations were called with three days’ notice because “his life hangs in the balance....We don’t know how long he can hold on. But it is clear we do not have time.”

The 44-year-old Navalny, President Vladimir Putin’s most visible and persistent critic, started a hunger strike more than three weeks ago to protest prison authorities’ refusal to allow him to be seen by a private doctor. He says he is suffering from severe back pain and loss of feeling in his legs, and that the medical care in prison inadequate; the Russian penitentiary service says he is getting appropriate care.

Several doctors went Sunday to the prison colony about 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Moscow where Navalny is serving time but were not allowed in to see him.

“It’s cruel and monstrous to deny access to a dying patient,” Anastasia Vasilyeva, the head of a Navalny-backed doctors’ union, said outside the prison.

A doctor said Saturday that test results he received from Navalny’s family showed sharply elevated levels of potassium, which could lead to cardiac arrest, and signs of kidney failure.

“Our patient could die at any moment,” the doctor, Yaroslav Ashikhmin, said.

There was no immediate comment from police or government officials about the call for protests, but the response is likely to be harsh. Police arrested more than 10,000 people during nationwide protests in January demanding Navalny’s freedom.

The Wednesday protests have been called for symbolically resonant locations — Manezh Square in Moscow, just outside the Kremlin walls, and St. Petersburg’s sprawling Palace Square.

Navalny was arrested on Jan. 17 when he returned to Russia from Germany, where he spent five months recovering from poisoning with a Soviet era nerve agent that he blames on the Kremlin. Russian officials have denied any involvement and questioned whether Navalny was poisoned, although several European laboratories confirmed that he was sickened with a Novichok nerve agent. .

Navalny was ordered to serve 2 1/2 years in prison on the grounds that his long recovery in Germany violated the terms of a suspended sentence he received for a fraud conviction in a case that Navalny says was politically motivated.

His arrest and subsequent health problems have brought repeated criticism from the West.

“We call on the Russian authorities to grant him immediate access to medical professionals he trusts,” European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Sunday. “The EU will continue to call for his immediate and unconditional release as we consider his sentencing politically motivated and running counter to Russia’s international human rights obligations.”

National security adviser Jake Sullivan said on CNN television that the United States is concerned about Navalny’s health.

“We have communicated to the Russian government that what happens to Mr. Navalny is their responsibility and they will be held accountable by the international community,” Sullivan said. “We have communicated that there will be consequences if Mr. Navalny dies.”",675,4288,9,60

Figures including author J.K. Rowling, actors Benedict Cumberbatch and David Duchovny called on Putin to offer Navalny, who is currently on a hunger strike, immediate medical treatment.

""As we write, Alexei Navalny is being held in a penal colony that many lawyers and human rights activists consider to be one of the harshest in Russia,"" the letter said.

""Alexei Navalny is exhibiting symptoms of a severe neurological disorder — constant back pain and the loss of sensation in his legs and hands. In addition, he is suffering from a severe cough and fever. As a Russian citizen, he has the lawful right to be examined and treated by a doctor of his choice.""

The open letter was published in Le Monde newspaper in France, The Economist, La Repubblica in Italy and Der Spiegel.

Putin 'must keep the law'

""We call on you, Mr. President, to ensure that Alexei Navalny is immediately given the medical treatment and care that he urgently requires — and is entitled to under Russian law. As someone who has sworn to uphold the law, you have only to do so,"" the letter said.

Later on Saturday, US President Joe Biden condemned Navalny's situation as ""totally, totally unfair,"" and ""totally inappropriate.""

Concerns over Navalny's deteriorating health

Navalny's personal doctor Anastasia Vasilyeva said Navalny ""can die any minute,"" in a post on Facebook on Saturday, pointing to high potassium levels.

She said he should be moved into an intensive care station, adding ""fatal arrhythmia can develop any minute.""

Vasilyeva and three more doctors including cardiologist Yaroslav Ashikhmin have asked prison officials to grant them immediate access.

On Monday, Navalny's aides said that prison officials were threatening to force-feed him as he conducts his hunger strike. He also said that authorities at the penal colony where he is being held had refused him proper treatment for acute back pain.

Navalny, who is Putin's most vocal opponent, survived a poisoning attack with the nerve agent Novichok last August. He was arrested in January of this year after returning to Russia from Germany, where he was treated for the poisoning. He was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison on prior embezzlement charges. His case has since become a sticking point for proponents of democratic values and human rights in Russia.",407,2500,10,60

MOSCOW (AP) — Russia on Friday responded to a barrage of new U.S. sanctions by saying it would expel 10 U.S. diplomats and take other retaliatory moves in a tense showdown with Washington.

The Russian Foreign Ministry also published a list of eight current or former U.S. officials barred from entering the country, including U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, FBI Director Christopher Wray, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas.

Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also said Moscow will move to shut down those U.S. nongovernment organizations that remain in Russia to end what he described as their meddling in Russia’s politics.

The top Russian diplomat said the Kremlin suggested that U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan follow the example of his Russian counterpart and head home for consultations. Russia will also deny the U.S. Embassy the possibility of hiring personnel from Russia and third countries as support staff, limit visits by U.S. diplomats serving short-term stints at the embassy, and tighten requirements for U.S. diplomats’ travel in the country.

The others banned from entering Russia are Susan Rice, a former U.N. ambassador and now head of the Domestic Policy Council; John Bolton, who was a national security adviser under former President Donald Trump; James Woolsey, a former CIA director; and Michael Carvajal, director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

On Thursday, the Biden administration announced sanctions on Russia for interfering in the 2020 U.S. presidential election and involvement in the SolarWind hack of federal agencies — activities Moscow has denied. The U.S. ordered 10 Russian diplomats expelled, targeted dozens of companies and people, and imposed new curbs on Russia’s ability to borrow money.

While the U.S. wields the power to cripple Russia’s economy, Moscow lacks levers to respond in kind, although it could hurt American interests in other ways globally.

Lavrov called Washington’s move “absolutely unfriendly and unprovoked,” and he said that while Russia could take “painful measures” against American business interests in Russia, it wouldn’t immediately move to do that and “save them for future use.”

He warned that if Washington further raises the pressure, Russia might ask the U.S. to reduce the number of its embassy and consular staff from about 450 to 300. He said both countries host about 450 diplomats, but that includes some 150 Russians at the U.N. in New York that he argued shouldn’t be included.

Russia’s economic potential and its global reach are limited compared with the Soviet Union that competed with the U.S for international influence during the Cold War. Still, Russia’s nuclear arsenal and its leverage in many parts of the world make it a power that Washington needs to reckon with.

Aware of that, President Joe Biden called for de-escalating tensions and held the door open for cooperation with Russia in certain areas. Biden said he told Putin in Tuesday’s call that he chose not to impose tougher sanctions for now and proposed to meet in a third country in the summer.

Lavrov said Russia had a “positive attitude” to the summit offer and was analyzing it, but a statement issued by the Foreign Ministry shortly after noted that it ”was being studied in the context of the evolving situation.”

The ministry charged that Russia would like to avoid further escalation and engage in a “calm and professional dialogue,” but has other means to retaliate if Washington tries to crank up the pressure.

While the new U.S. sanctions further limited Russia’s ability to borrow money by banning U.S. financial institutions from buying Russian government bonds directly from state institutions, they didn’t target the secondary market.

“It’s very important that there’re no sanctions on secondary debt because that means that non-U.S. persons can buy the debt and sell it to the U.S. persons,” said Tom Adshead, director of research at Macro-Advisory Ltd, an analytics and advisory company.

Timothy Frye, a Columbia University political scientist, noted that Biden chose not to target the prospective Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline to Germany or go after large Russian state-controlled companies.

“That’s part of the broader strategy of using sanctions but also reaching out to the Kremlin to propose talks on strategic stability and eventually on a summit,” he said.

Tougher restrictions would also hurt Western businesses, inflict significant economic pain on ordinary Russians and allow Putin to rally anti-U.S. sentiments to shore up his rule.

Ramping up sanctions could eventually drive Russia into a corner and provoke even more reckless Kremlin action, leading to a potential escalation in Ukraine, which has seen a surge in clashes with Russia-backed separatists in the east and a massive Russian troop buildup across the border.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was in Paris on Friday to discuss the tensions with French President Emmanuel Macron. After a joint call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the three urged Russia to pull back its troops to de-escalate the situation.

Fyodor Lukyanov, a top foreign policy expert who leads the Moscow-based Council for Foreign and Defense Policies, predicted Putin would likely accept Biden’s invitation to join next week’s call on climate change but could drag his feet on the summit offer.

“There is no way to make any deals,” Lukyanov said. “There is a mutual antipathy and a total lack of trust.”

He said the only practical outcome of the summit could be an agreement to launch long and difficult talks on a replacement to the New START nuclear reduction agreement that Russia and the U.S. extended in February for another five years.

Lukyanov noted that the growing U.S. pressure will push Russia and China closer in the long run.

“Closer cooperation with China on coordinating actions to contain the United States will develop more quickly now as the Chinese are interested in that,” he said. While Russia lacks tools for a symmetrical answer to the U.S. sanctions, “it has ample capabilities to stimulate changes in the world order,” he added.

Konstantin Kosachev, the Kremlin-connected deputy speaker of the upper house of parliament, said that by imposing sanctions and proposing a summit at the same time, the U.S. sought to take a commanding stance.

“Russia’s consent would be interpreted as a reflection of its desire to soften the sanctions, allowing the U.S. to secure a dominant position at the meeting, while our refusal to meet would be a convenient pretext for more punitive measures,” Kosachev wrote on Facebook.

He argued that Russia should not rush to accept Biden’s summit offer.

“Revenge is a dish best served cold,” Kosachev wrote. “I believe the saying is quite adaptable to a situation when we talk not about revenge but a due answer to aggressive action by an opponent.”

Some predicted the U.S. sanctions could discourage Russia from cooperating with the U.S. on international crises.

“The Russian position will grow tougher on Syria, the Iranian nuclear deal and other issues,” Ivan Timofeev, program director at Russian International Affairs Council, said in a commentary. Instead of acting as a deterrent, he warned, the sanctions would “only anger Russia and make its policy even tougher.”

But despite the soaring tensions, Russia and the U.S. have shared interests in many global hot spots. For example, Moscow fears that instability could spread from Afghanistan to former Soviet republics in Central Asia, and it is interested in a political settlement there.

As for Iran, Moscow also doesn’t want to see it with nuclear weapons, despite its friendly ties with Tehran.

Lukyanov said Russia wouldn’t try to use global hot spots to hurt the U.S. and would wait patiently to see them erode U.S. domination.

“It’s not a matter of playing the spoiler here or there,” he said. “The ongoing developments will help accelerate the process of consolidation of leading powers against the U.S. domination.”

India pledged on Friday to raise monthly production of its own COVID-19 vaccine about tenfold to nearly 100 million doses by September, as immunisations have slowed in the country despite a surge in new infections.

After donating and selling tens of millions vaccine doses abroad, India has suddenly found itself short of Covaxin, its only domestically made shot. The government is now trying to raise production at manufacturer Bharat Biotech, and fast-track imports of other vaccines. read more

The ministry of science and technology, giving the September target, pegged current capacity at 10 million doses a month.

""The current production capacity of indigenously developed Covaxin vaccine will be doubled by May-June 2021 and then increased nearly 6-7 fold by July-August,"" it said.

The ministry added that the government would provide $17 million in funding to boost Covaxin output. Apart from Bharat Biotech, two state-sector firms - Haffkine Biopharmaceutical and Indian Immunologicals Ltd - will develop a combined monthly capacity of up to 35 million doses in the coming months, under the plan.

India's daily vaccinations peaked at 4.5 million doses on April 5, as its second wave of infections picked up, but have averaged about 3 million a day since then, according to the government's Co-Win portal that coordinates immunisations.

The AstraZeneca (AZN.L) vaccine, made locally by the Serum Institute of India (SII), accounts for more than 91% of the 115.5 million doses given in the country. But a production ramp-up at SII, the world's biggest vaccine maker, has been delayed by a raw-material shortage due to U.S. supply restrictions.

ENOUGH FOR NINE DAYS

SII Chief Executive Adar Poonawalla appealed directly to U.S. President Joe Biden to end the supply curb, which is aimed at supporting American vaccine companies.

""Respected @POTUS, if we are to truly unite in beating this virus, on behalf of the vaccine industry outside the U.S., I humbly request you to lift the embargo of raw-material exports out of the U.S. so that vaccine production can ramp up,"" Poonawalla said on Twitter.

India has reported the most number of COVID-19 cases in the world this month. Its total of 14.3 million infections since the pandemic began is the most after the United States. India has also recorded 174,308 deaths. read more

Many vaccination centres in India are now rationing supplies though they are only inoculating people above 45 years, having started the campaign in mid-January with front-line workers.

India has administered the most doses in the world after the United States and China, but it ranks much lower per capita.

The government said on Friday the country had a stock of about 26.7 million doses of vaccines. Going by vaccination rates in the past week, that will last about nine days.

India this week gave emergency authorisation to Russia's Sputnik V vaccine and imports to cover as many as 125 million people will start this month. The government has also urged Pfizer, Moderna (MRNA.O) and Johnson and Johnson (JNJ.N) to sell their shots to India.

0,Saudi and Iran held secret talks over Yemen conflict: report,https://www.dw.com/en/saudi-and-iran-held-secret-talks-over-yemen-conflict-report/a-57243546,"Senior Saudi and Iranian officials have held direct talks in an effort to repair relations between the two countries, four years after cutting off diplomatic ties, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.

The first round of talks took place in Baghdad on April 9, included discussions about attacks on Saudi Arabia by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi group, and was positive, the FT reported, citing officials briefed on the discussions.

The report also cited a senior Saudi official, however, denying that any talks had taken place.

The two regional rivals severed ties in 2016 over Riyadh’s execution of Shi’ite Muslim cleric, Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, an outspoken opponent of the ruling Al Saudi family.

Meetings amid new nuclear talks

The talks took place as Washington and Tehran try to revive a 2015 nuclear accord, which Riyadh has objected to.

The US is also pressing for an end to the ongoing conflict in Yemen, which is seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

Riyadh has called for a nuclear pact with stronger parameters and has said that Gulf Arab states should join any negotiations on the accord to ensure that it addresses Tehran's missile program and its support for regional proxies.

Former US President Donald Trump quit the nuclear agreement and reimposed sanctions on Iran in 2018 -- a move that Saudi Arabia and its allies supported.

Iran responded to the sanctions by breaching several restrictions on its nuclear activities.

The nuclear agreement's remaining signatories — Iran, the EU, Germany, France, the UK, Russia and China — have been holding talks in Vienna to pave the way for the US to rejoin.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has also previously indicated that he wants to cool hostilities with Arab rivals.

Iran announces progress on uranium

On Friday, Iran announced that it had started enriching uranium up to 60% purity, in the latest move to boost its nuclear capabilities.

The alleged enrichment level is now at its highest level, and follows a sabotage incident at Iran's Natanz nuclear plant the week prior.

Although 60% enrichment of uranium is a record high for Iran, it is still below the 90% threshold required for nuclear weapons.

The announcement marked a significant escalation of tensions in the Middle East, and casts doubt over the chances of finding a middle ground on the nuclear deal.

The change in enrichment was both an effort to convince other countries to come to the negotiating table and discuss its nuclear program, as well as a response to the act of sabotage at Natanz, which Iran blames on Israel.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran began enriching uranium Friday to its highest-ever purity, edging close to weapons-grade levels, as it attempts to pressure negotiators in Vienna during talks on restoring its nuclear deal with world powers after an attack on its main enrichment site.

A top official said only a few grams an hour of uranium gas would be enriched up to 60% purity — triple its previous level but at a quantity far lower than what the Islamic Republic had been able to produce. Iran also is enriching at an above-ground facility at its Natanz nuclear site already visited by international inspectors, not deep within underground halls hardened to withstand airstrikes.

The narrow scope of the new enrichment provides Iran with a way to quickly de-escalate if it chooses, experts say, but time is narrowing. An Iranian presidential election looms on the horizon as Tehran already threatens to limit international inspections. Israel, suspected of carrying out Sunday’s sabotage at Natanz, also could act again amid a long-running shadow war between the two Middle East rivals.

Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, Iran’s parliament speaker, announced the higher enrichment on Twitter.

“The young and God-believing Iranian scientists managed to achieve a 60% enriched uranium product,” Qalibaf said. “I congratulate the brave nation of Islamic Iran on this success. The Iranian nation’s willpower is miraculous and can defuse any conspiracy.”

The head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, the country’s civilian nuclear arm, later acknowledged the move to 60%. Ali Akbar Salehi told Iranian state television the centrifuges now produce 9 grams an hour, but that would drop to 5 grams an hour in the coming days.

“Any enrichment level that we desire is in our reach at the moment and we can do it at any time we want,” Salehi said.

It wasn’t clear why the first announcement came from Qalibaf, a hard-line former leader in the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard already named as a potential presidential candidate in Iran’s upcoming June election .

While 60% is higher than any level Iran previously enriched uranium, it is still lower than weapons-grade levels of 90%. Iran had been enriching up to 20% — and even that was a short technical step to weapons-grade. The deal limited Iran’s enrichment to 3.67%.

The International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors Iran’s nuclear program, did not respond to a request for comment. Earlier this week, it sent its inspectors to Natanz and confirmed Iran was preparing to begin 60% enrichment at an above-ground facility at the site.

Israel, which has twice bombed Mideast countries to stop their nuclear programs, plans to hold a meeting of its top security officials Sunday over the Iranian announcement.

“Israel is determined to defend itself against any attempt to harm its sovereignty or citizens, and will do whatever it takes to prevent this radical and anti-Semitic regime from acquiring nuclear weapons,” Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi said in Cyprus.

Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful, though the West and the IAEA say Tehran had an organized military nuclear program up until the end of 2003. An annual U.S. intelligence report released Tuesday maintained the longtime American assessment that Iran isn’t currently trying to build a nuclear bomb.

Iran previously had said it could use uranium enriched up to 60% for nuclear-powered ships. However, the Islamic Republic currently has no such ships in its navy.

The threat of higher enrichment by Iran already had drawn criticism from the U.S. and three European nations in the deal — France, Germany and the United Kingdom. On Friday, European Union spokesman Peter Stano called Iran’s decision “a very worrisome development.”

Full Coverage: Iran

“There is no credible explanation or civilian justification for such an action on the side of Iran,” Stano said. The Vienna talks aim to “make sure that we go back from such steps that bring Iran further away from delivering on its commitments and obligations.”

Diplomats reconvened Friday in Vienna, with more talks planned Saturday, Russian representative Mikhail Ulyanov said. Chinese negotiator Wang Qun earlier called for doing “away with all disruptive factors by moving forward as swiftly as we can on the work of negotiations, especially by zeroing in on sanction lifting.”

The 2015 nuclear deal, which former President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from in 2018, prevented Iran from stockpiling enough high-enriched uranium to be able to pursue a nuclear weapon if it chose in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.

In Washington, President Joe Biden said Tehran’s latest step was contrary to the deal. “We do not support and do not think it’s at all helpful,” he said. But he added that the Vienna talks had not been sidetracked.

“We are nonetheless pleased that Iran has agreed to continue to engage in indirect discussions with us on how we move forward and what is needed to get back” into the nuclear deal, he said. “It’s premature to make a judgment as to what the outcome will be, but we’re still talking.”

The weekend attack at Natanz was initially described only as a blackout in its electrical grid — but later Iranian officials began calling it an attack.

One Iranian official referred to “several thousand centrifuges damaged and destroyed” in a state TV interview. However, no other official has offered that figure and no images of the aftermath have been released.

In the coming weeks, Iran has threatened to further impede IAEA inspections and potentially destroy video recordings it now holds of its facilities . Meanwhile, it continues to use advanced centrifuges and gain know-how in high enrichment, something that worries nonproliferation experts.

“Because the deal has started to unravel, Iran has begun to acquire more knowledge about how to operate more advanced machines,” said Daryl G. Kimball, the executive director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association. “This particular operation, enriching to 60%, is going to give it even more information.”

Borrowing a term used to describe diluting high-enriched uranium, Kimball added: “That knowledge cannot be down-blended. It cannot be reversed.”

0,Oil to hit $40 by 2030 if climate goals are met -consultancy,https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-hit-40-by-2030-if-climate-goals-are-met-consultancy-2021-04-15/,"A sticker reads crude oil on the side of a storage tank in the Permian Basin in Mentone, Loving County, Texas, U.S. November 22, 2019. REUTERS/Angus Mordant

Global oil prices could drop to around $40 a barrel by 2030 if governments push to reduce fuel consumption in step with U.N.-backed plans to limit global warming, a leading energy consultancy said on Thursday.

In a report outlining a scenario where the world acts decisively to tackle greenhouse gas emissions by electrifying transport and industry, Edinburgh-based Wood Mackenzie said oil consumption would begin a steep drop as early as in 2023.

The decline in demand would accelerate to a rate of 2 million barrels of oil per day (bpd) to reach 35 million bpd by 2050, accounting for a 60% drop in carbon emissions from oil use from today's levels.

Oil consumption hit a record of around 100 million bpd in 2019 and is expected to recover strongly this year after cratering last year due to the coronavirus epidemic.

As a result, oil prices would begin to slip later this decade, WoodMac said in its report. Under its Accelerated Energy Transition scenario, it expects Brent crude prices to average $40 per barrel by 2030, compared with current prices of around $65 a barrel.

By 2050, Brent may slide to $10 to $18 a barrel.

""If we move to keep global warming to the 2 degrees Celsius limit set by the (U.N.-backed) Paris Agreement, the energy matrix will change – and change profoundly,"" said WoodMac's Ann-Louise Hittle.

The world's current policies are nevertheless far from aligned with the Paris agreement, with temperatures currently on course to rise by 3 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels by 2100, WoodMac stressed.

A rapid decline in demand also means that existing sources of oil supplies would be sufficient to meet all future demand, with only limited need for new oifield developments, WoodMac said.

A sharp fall in oil demand and prices in the coming decades would have a profound impact on major oil producers such as members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, WoodMac said.

""The steep fall in demand prevents those key oil producers from managing the market and supporting prices in the way it does today. Despite losing their price-setting ability, however, low-cost Middle East OPEC producers remain core providers of oil.""

Natural gas, the least polluting fossil fuel, would, however, fare better than oil by replacing coal for power generation, particularly in fast-growing Asian economies, the report added.

As oil prices declined, gas would eventually trade at a premium to oil under WoodMac's scenario. Benchmark U.S. Henry Hub prices are forecast to trade at $3 to $4 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) under WoodMac's scenario.

Gas demand in Asia would increase on average by 1.5% a year through to 2050, offsetting declines in more mature markets, which would be switching to renewables from gas.

REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/Pool

President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday applauded the painstaking work to restore Notre-Dame de Paris, two years after a fire destroyed the cathedral's centuries-old attic and sent its spire crashing through the vaults below.

In the hours after the blaze, Macron told a distraught nation that the cathedral, which dates back to the 12th century, would be rebuilt and later promised it would be reopened to worshippers by 2024, when France hosts the Olympic Games.

More than 700 days after workers scrambled to shore-up Notre-Dame's flying buttresses, save its 13th-century stained-glass rose windows and install movement sensors, the effort to make the site secure ahead of restoration is almost complete.

From a rooftop platform, the president, dressed in a dark boiler suit and a white safety helmet, peered down into the cathedral's damaged transept and thanked workers on the site.

""We're all impressed with what we see, with the work that has been achieved in two years. Bravo,"" Macron told workers with the Paris skyline behind him.

""We've done a lot, and we've avoided the worst.""

For many in the capital the emotion of that night remains raw.

""We were all stunned,"" said Paris resident Stacy Monsauret. ""And then it was just sadness.""

The first phase of the salvage operation was complicated by the need to cut up a 200-tonne mass of twisted metal left after the fire consumed scaffolding that had been erected around the wood-and-lead spire at the time of the blaze.

Work was also temporarily halted because of worries over lead contamination and slowed at times by the coronavirus pandemic.

Technicians still have to reinforce some of the vaults closest to those destroyed with wooden arch-shaped frames that are lifted into place by crane, and extend a tarpaulin roof over the transept to protect the restoration work once it begins.

""HOLDING UP""

The cathedral will only be declared out of danger once the phase to secure the site is complete, but all the indications were positive, said Jeremie Patrier-Leitus, a spokesman for the public body overseeing the restoration.

""The cathedral hasn't moved since the fire, it's holding up.""

The cathedral will be restored to its original design, including the 96-metre (315-feet) spire designed by architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc and added in the mid-1800s. The felling of oaks for the new spire's frame has begun. read more

Financing for the restoration was not a concern yet, said General Jean-Louis Georgelin, the former army chief of staff named by Macron to head the renovation. Some 834 million euros in donations flooded in from billionaire tycoons and households in France and abroad in the fire's aftermath.

""We will need all these donations to complete the necessary work. We need people to keep giving money,"" Georgelin told France Inter radio.

Tearful Parisians and stunned tourists gazed in disbelief while the inferno raged at the cathedral, which marks the very centre of Paris. Some sang liturgical music in harmonies late into the night as they stood vigil, while others prayed.

GDP growth of 18.3% year-on-year in the first quarter was the strongest since China began keeping records in 1992, and was driven by a surge in retail sales, industrial production and investment in fixed assets.

The big jump reflects the deep slump in activity in early 2020 but it keeps China on track for growth of between 8% and 9% in 2021, economists said, far ahead of the Chinese government's official target of more than 6%.

0,8 Killed in Mass Shooting at FedEx Warehouse in Indianapolis,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/us/indianapolis-shooting-fedex.html,"Go here for live updates on the shooting in Indianapolis.

At least eight people died in a shooting at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis late Thursday, and the gunman was believed to have taken his own life, the police said.

Here’s what we know about the shooting so far.

What happened?

The police said officers arrived at the facility just after 11 p.m., responding to a report that shots had been fired.

Deputy Chief Craig McCartt of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department said at a news conference on Friday that officers “found a very chaotic and active crime scene,” including several people injured and several people dead. Among them was the gunman, with “an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound,” he said.

Chief McCartt said that, based on preliminary interviews, the gunman “pretty quickly started some random shooting outside the facility” after getting out of his car.

The announcement was posted on the website of the U.S. Embassy in Chad, which pointed to the proximity of rebel groups to the nation's capital.

""On April 17, 2021, the Department ordered the departure of non-emergency U.S. government employees from U.S. Embassy N’Djamena due to civil unrest and armed violence,"" the warning read.

""Armed non-governmental groups in northern Chad have moved south and appear to be heading toward N’Djamena. Due to their growing proximity to N’Djamena, and the possibility for violence in the city, non-essential U.S. Government employees have been ordered to leave Chad by commercial airline. U.S. citizens in Chad wishing to depart should take advantage of commercial flights,"" it continued.

Rebel groups have frequently tried to overthrow Idriss Déby, Chad's self-proclaimed president who has ruled the country for more than three decades after launching a successful coup himself. Déby is supported by France and the U.S., which consider him and the country an important ally against Islamist extremists in the region.

Rebel forces posted on social media late last week that they had overtaken a Chadian army base in the country's northern region, while claiming that the army was receiving logistical support from France.

""The enemy, despite the logistical support of the French Air Force, was totally routed,"" read a statement from a Front for Change and Concord in Chad (FACT) spokesperson, according to Reuters.

France's defense ministry would not confirm to the news service whether it was involved in the ongoing security efforts in Chad.

Authorities have identified the shooter as Brandon Scott Hole a local man who last worked for FedEx in 2020 and had previous run-ins with police during a suicidal episode.

Cops still don’t know why Hole used a rifle to kill eight people and wound five others around 11 p.m. Thursday.

“We’ve recently identified him, so now, the work really begins, trying to establish and see if we can figure out some sort of motive in this, but we don’t have that right now,” said Deputy Chief Craig McCartt said at a press conference Friday afternoon.

It was also unclear where Hole got the rifle he used at the plant near the Indianapolis International Airport.

“There were at least 100 people in the facility at the time of the incident. … Many were changing shifts and were on their dinner breaks,” McCartt said.

The fatal victims have not yet been identified, police said.

“Crime Lab is still here they are finishing processing the scene,” McCartt said. “They’re working closely with the coroner’s office. We’re to the point now where we’re identifying victims, making notifications to the family, and then hopefully we’ll wrap up the processing of this crime scene here very shortly.”

Authorities were previously warned about Hole in 2020 when his mother told police she was worried he’d commit suicide by cop.

HAVANA -- Raul Castro said Friday he is stepping down as head of Cuba’s Communist Party, ending an era of formal leadership that began with his brother Fidel and country’s 1959 revolution.

The 89-year-old Castro made the announcement in a speech at the opening of the eighth congress of the ruling party, the only one allowed on the island.

He said he was retiring with the sense of having “fulfilled his mission and confident in the future of the fatherland.”

“Nothing, nothing, nothing is forcing me to make this decision,” said Castro, part of whose speech to the closed Congress was aired on state television. “As long as I live I will be ready with my foot in the stirrup to defend the homeland, the revolution and socialism with more force than ever.”

Castro didn’t say who he would endorse as his successor as first secretary of the Communist Party. But he previously indicated he favors yielding control to 60-year-old Miguel Díaz-Canel, who succeeded him as president in 2018 and is the standard bearer of a younger generation of loyalists who have been pushing an economic opening without touching Cuba’s one-party system.

Photographs released by the official Cuban News Agency showed Castro, dressed in an olive green uniform, entering the compound with Díaz-Canel by his side.

Castro's retirement means that for the first time in more than six decades Cubans won’t have a Castro formally guiding their affairs and many had been expecting the change.

“One has to step aside for the young people,"" said 64-year-old retiree Juana Busutil, for whom Castro “is going to continue being the leader.”

The transition comes at a difficult time for Cuba, with many on the island anxious about what lies ahead.

The coronavirus pandemic, painful financial reforms and restrictions imposed by the Trump administration have battered the economy, which shrank 11% last year as a result of a collapse in tourism and remittances. Long food lines and shortages have brought back echoes of the “special period” that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s.

Discontent has been fueled by the spread of the internet and growing inequality.

Much of the debate inside Cuba is focused on the pace of reform, with many complaining that the so-called “historic generation” represented by Castro has been too slow to open the economy.

In January, Díaz-Canel finally pulled the trigger on a plan approved two congresses ago to unify the island’s dual currency system, giving rise to fears of inflation. He also threw the doors open to a broader range of private enterprise — a category long banned or tightly restricted — permitting Cubans to legally operate many sorts of self-run businesses from their homes.

This year’s congress is expected to focus on unfinished reforms to overhaul state-run enterprises, attract foreign investment and provide more legal protection to private business activities.

The Communist Party is made up of 700,000 activists and is tasked in Cuba’s constitution with directing the affairs of the nation and society.

Fidel Castro, who led the revolution that drove dictator Fulgencio Batista from power in 1959, formally became head of the party in 1965, about four years after officially embracing socialism.

He quickly absorbed the old party under his control and was the country’s unquestioned leader until falling ill in 2006 and in 2008 handing over the presidency to his younger brother Raul, who had fought alongside him during the revolution.

Raul succeeded him as head of the party in 2011. Fidel Castro died in 2016

For most of his life, Raul played second-string to his brother Fidel — first as a guerrilla commander, later as a senior figure in their socialist government. But for the past decade, it’s Raul who has been the face of communist Cuba and its defiance of U.S. efforts to oust its socialist system.

The fourth of seven children of a Spanish immigrant in eastern Cuba, Raul had joined his charismatic older brother in a nearly suicidal attack on the Moncada military barracks in the eastern city of Santiago in 1953 and survived the crackdown that followed from the forces of dictator Fulgencio Batista.

He led a major front in the ensuing guerrilla war led by Fidel that toppled Batista. And he served for the following generation or two as head of the armed forces. For many years, he was considered a more orthodox communist than his brother.

But it was Raul who reached accords with U.S. President Barack Obama in 2014 that created the most extensive U.S. opening to Cuba since the early 1960s — creating a surge in contacts with the United States that was largely reversed under Obama’s successor, Donald Trump.

Now, with Raul Castro stepping down as party leader amid change and challenges, some say the island needs continuity going forward.

“All process have a continuity and I think Díaz-Canel should be there now,” said 58-year-old driver Miguel Rodríguez.",851,5124,10,60
0,Macron slams breakaway European football ‘super league’ plan,https://www.politico.eu/article/emmanuel-macron-european-super-league-football/,"French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Sunday their governments would support attempts to stifle the creation of a controversial European football “super league.”

As Europe’s top football clubs plan to defect imminently from UEFA’s elite competitions to set up a lucrative self-governed tournament, Macron said France would support “all the steps” taken by football’s governing bodies to defend Europe’s existing competitions. Johnson later added that creating a super league would be “very damaging for football and we support football authorities in taking action.”

According to one person familiar with behind-the-scenes discussions, the Italian and Spanish governments will echo that position.

Simmering talk of a breakaway league exploded earlier Sunday, when the Times reported that five of England’s so-called Big Six clubs had agreed to sign up to the new league. The New York Times later reported that 12 total clubs — six from England, three from Spain and three from Italy — had already agreed in principle to join the rebel tournament.

In France, where Qatari-backed behemoth Paris Saint-Germain have reportedly refused overtures to join the money-spinning breakaway competition, Macron said the proposal “threatened the principle of sporting merit.”

Reaction from European football chiefs to the proposal, which would upend decades of football governance in Europe and wrest control of the game away from the governing body, was also swift and vehement. In a joint statement, UEFA and Europe’s top national leagues called the proposal “cynical” and “founded on self-interest” — and delivered an unveiled threat.

“We will consider all measures available to us, at all levels, both judicial and sporting in order to prevent this happening,” the statement said.

In January, FIFA and UEFA threatened to ban any “super league” players from international tournaments, including the World Cup, a position which the EU supported and was echoed in Sunday’s UEFA statement.

At that time, European Commission Vice President Margaritis Schinas said, “There is no scope for the few to distort the universal and diverse nature of European football.”

In a statement, the European Parliament’s sports group condemned the “super league” proposal. It said that the breakaway competition would contravene the “values” championed by the group.

The European Club Association, which represents professional football teams in Europe, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

BHANNINE, Lebanon (AP) — It was messy and hectic in Aisha al-Abed’s kitchen, as the first day of Ramadan often is. Food had to be on the table at precisely 7:07 p.m. when the sun sets and the daylong fast ends.

What is traditionally a jovial celebration of the start of the Muslim holy month around a hearty meal was muted and dispirited for her small Syrian refugee family.

As the 21-year-old mother of two worked, with her toddler daughter in tow, reminders of life’s hardships were everywhere: In the makeshift kitchen, where she crouched on the ground to chop cucumbers next to a single-burner gas stove. In their home: a tent with a concrete floor and wooden walls covered in a tarp. And, definitely, in their iftar meal -- rice, lentil soup, french fries and a yogurt-cucumber dip; her sister sent over a little chicken and fish.

“This is going to be a very difficult Ramadan,” al-Abed said. “This should be a better meal ... After a day’s fast, one needs more nutrition for the body. Of course, I feel defeated.”

Ramadan, which began Tuesday, comes as Syrian refugees’ life of displacement has gotten even harder amid their host country Lebanon’s economic woes. The struggle can be more pronounced during the holy month, when fasting is typically followed by festive feasting to fill empty stomachs.

“High prices are killing people,” said Raed Mattar, al-Abed’s 24-year-old husband. “We may fast all day and then break our fast on only an onion,” he said, using an Arabic proverb usually meant to convey disappointment after long patience.

Lebanon, home to more than 1 million Syrian refugees, is reeling from an economic crisis exacerbated by the pandemic and a massive explosion that destroyed parts of the capital last August.

Citing the impact of the compounded crises, a U.N. study said the proportion of Syrian refugee families living under the extreme poverty line — the equivalent of roughly $25 a month per person by current black market rates — swelled to 89% in 2020, compared to 55% the previous year.

More people resorted to reducing the size or number of meals, it said. Half the Syrian refugee families surveyed suffer from food insecurity, up from 28% at the same time in 2019, it said.

Refugees are not alone in their pain. The economic turmoil, which is the culmination of years of corruption and mismanagement, has squeezed the Lebanese, plunging 55% of the country’s 5 million people into poverty and shuttering businesses.

As jobs became scarce, Mattar said more Lebanese competed for the low-paying construction and plumbing jobs previously left largely for foreign workers like himself. Wages lost their value as the local currency, fixed to the dollar for decades, collapsed. Mattar went from making the equivalent of more than $13 a day to less than $2, roughly the price of a kilo and a half (about 3 pounds) of non-subsidized sugar.

“People are kind and are helping, but the situation has become disastrous,” he said. “The Lebanese themselves can’t live. Imagine how we are managing.”

Nerves are fraying. Mattar was among hundreds displaced from an informal camp last year after a group of Lebanese set it on fire following a fight between a Syrian and a Lebanese.

It was the fifth displacement for al-Abed’s young family, bouncing mainly between informal settlements in northern Lebanon. They had to move twice after that, once when a Lebanese landowner doubled the rent, telling Mattar he can afford it since he gets aid as a refugee. Their current tent is in Bhannine.

This year, Syrians marked the 10th anniversary of the start of the uprising-turned-civil war in their country. Many refugees say they cannot return because their homes were destroyed or they fear retribution, either for being considered opposition or for evading military conscription, like Mattar. He and al-Abed each fled Syria in 2011 and met in Lebanon.

Even before Ramadan started, Rahaf al-Saghir, another Syrian in Lebanon, fretted over what her family’s iftar would look like.

“I don’t know what to do,” said the recently widowed mother of three daughters. “The girls keep saying they crave meat, they crave chicken, biscuits and fruit.”

As the family’s options dwindled, her daughters’ questions became more heart wrenching. Why can’t we have chips like the neighbors’ kids? Why don’t we drink milk to grow up like they say on television? Al-Saghir recalled breaking into tears when her youngest asked her what the strawberry she was seeing on television tasted like. She later bought her some, using U.N. assistance money, she said.

For Ramadan, al-Saghir was determined to stop her daughters from seeing photos of other people’s iftar meals. “I don’t want them to compare themselves to others,” she said. “When you are fasting in Ramadan, you crave a lot of things.”

The start of Ramadan, the first since al-Saghir’s husband died, brought tears. Her oldest daughters were used to their father waking them for suhoor, the pre-dawn meal before the day’s fast, which he’d prepare.

A few months before he died — of cardiac arrest — the family moved into a one-bedroom apartment shared with a relative’s family.

This year, their first iftar was simple — french fries, soup and fattoush salad. Al-Saghir wanted chicken but decided it was too expensive.

Before violence uprooted them from Syria, Ramadan felt festive. Al-Saghir would cook and exchange visits with family and neighbors, gathering around scrumptious savory and sweet dishes.

“Now, there’s no family, no neighbors and no sweets,” she said. “Ramadan feels like any other day. We may even feel more sorrow.”

Amid her struggles, she turns to her faith.

“I keep praying to God,” she said. “May our prayers in Ramadan be answered and may our situation change. ... May a new path open for us.”

The United States opened more distance between itself and much of the rest of the world Thursday, nearing the 200 millionth vaccine administered in a race to protect the population against COVID-19, even as other countries, rich and poor, struggle with stubbornly high infection rates and deaths.

Nearly half of American adults have gotten at least one dose of the vaccine, and about 30% of adults in the U.S. have been fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the picture is still relentlessly grim in parts of Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia as variants of the virus fuel an increase in new cases and the worldwide death toll closes in on 3 million.

France on Thursday passed 100,000 virus deaths , becoming only the the eighth country to do so.

India’s two largest cities, New Delhi and Mumbai, imposed business shutdowns and stringent restrictions on movement as new infections shot past 200,000. Some hotels and banquet halls were ordered to convert their space into wards for treating virus patients, and the surge forced India — a major vaccine producer — to delay exports of doses to other countries.

Japan also saw a rapid resurgence of infections just three months before it’s scheduled to host the Olympics. The country’s western metropolis of Osaka reported over 1,200 new infections Thursday, its highest since the pandemic began. A top ruling party official suggested the possibility of canceling the games if the infections make them impossible.

Troubling signs also emerged in the U.S., despite the good news that more than 198 million coronavirus shots have been administered nationwide. The seven-day average of daily shots given hit 2.9 million last week.

New daily infections in the U.S. have increased 11% in the past two weeks. Many U.S. states have lifted mask mandates and restrictions on businesses and public gatherings. But more sick people are being admitted to hospitals in some states, including Michigan, which leads the nation with nearly 8,000 new infections per day.

In suburban Detroit, Dr. Nick Gilpin of Beaumont Health likened a rising crush of coronavirus patients to a “runaway train.” Staff were using tents to handle the flow of people seeking emergency care from Michigan’s largest hospital system, which on Thursday was treating more than 800 patients for COVID-19. That’s up from about 500 two weeks ago.

“Our COVID-19 numbers are climbing higher and faster, and it’s very troubling and alarming to see this,” said John Fox, chief executive of Beaumont Health, which operates eight hospitals.

Coronavirus patients statewide were near record numbers in Michigan, which had 3,960 people with confirmed infections hospitalized Wednesday.

Even though half of U.S. adults are still completely unvaccinated, dwindling demand for coronavirus shots was reported by some hospitals in Alabama and Missouri. Both states already lag the nation overall in vaccinating their populations.

In Alabama, only 37% of adults have received even one vaccine dose. Yet East Alabama Medical Center near Auburn University said it was preparing to wind down its vaccination program in a county where fewer than 18% are fully vaccinated.

“The number of vaccine requests has reached a plateau,” hospital spokesman John Atkinson said in a statement.

Cullman Regional Medical Center north of Birmingham also cited declining demand in a statement announcing that its vaccine clinic was being moved to an urgent care center. Hospital spokeswoman Lindsey Dossey later said the drop in demand was because of “more access to the vaccine” at other sites.

Health care officials in Missouri are also worried that not enough people are seeking shots. A large federally operated vaccination site in downtown St. Louis is administering less than half its capacity of 3,000 shots per day. Missouri health department spokeswoman Lisa Cox said the number of public health agencies requesting vaccine last week was down half compared to a week earlier.

“Some of them do feel like they have really hit a wall as far as who is interested,” Cox said, adding that the state plans to start a public awareness campaign soon.

In other developments, the U.S. government reported Thursday that some vaccinated people, as expected, have become sick from the coronavirus, though such cases are rare. The CDC said about 5,800 of the “breakthrough” infections have been confirmed. That’s out of about 75 million Americans who have been fully vaccinated, but the agency warned that reporting of such cases is uneven and incomplete.

Full Coverage: Coronavirus pandemic

Serious illness among vaccinated Americans is even more rare, with fewer than 400 who were hospitalized and 74 who died. As with the flu, people who get COVID-19 after being vaccinated are more likely to have a milder illness than unvaccinated people, the CDC has said.

More than a third of the world’s deaths have occurred in three countries — the United States, Mexico and Brazil, where a total of more than 1.1 million have perished. The virus is claiming about 12,000 lives each day.

The recent decision to suspend the use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine due to preliminary reports of rare blood clots left South Africa without any shots in its battle against an aggressive coronavirus variant. South Africa has more than 1.5 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, including at least 53,000 deaths, representing more than 30% of all the confirmed cases in Africa’s 54 countries.

Meanwhile, Germany’s health ministry announced that the country administered a national record of more than 738,000 vaccine shots Wednesday, though authorities also warned that hospitals were seeing a dramatic rise in coronavirus patients.

0,Social media blocked in Pakistan | Likely a martial law test,https://www.dawn.com/news/1618552/social-media-blocked-in-pakistan-until-3pm-to-maintain-public-order,"The Ministry of Interior on Friday directed the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to temporarily block access to social media platforms — Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube and Telegram — from 11am to 3pm.

""It is requested that immediate action may be taken on the subject matter,"" the ministry directed the PTA chairman.

Shortly after, the PTA released an official statement saying: ""In order to maintain public order and safety, access to certain social media applications has been restricted temporarily.""

Following the interior ministry's directives, Nayatel — an internet service provider — said in a message to its customers that social media platforms had been blocked on the directions of the PTA.

A copy of the notification issued by the Ministry of Interior.

These platforms include Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, TikTok and Telegram. ""The inconvenience is regretted,"" it said.

After 3pm, users reported that the social media platforms had been partially restored.

The PTA too issued a statement saying ""access to social media applications has been restored.""

Although the notification issued by the interior ministry did not mention a reason for the suspension, the development comes after several days of unrest in the country due to protests by the recently proscribed Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP).

In a video message, Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid apologised to the public for the hours-long blockage of the applications, saying the government will ""try not to [restrict] social media in the future"".

He said the social media platforms were blocked because the TLP had issued a call to its activists to come out on the streets for protests after Friday prayers.

The minister said due to the government's efforts, ""the terrorists, agitators and those spreading unrest through social media have been defeated"".

Detained TLP chief Saad Rizvi, in a purported handwritten note shared by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Political Communication Shahbaz Gill late on Thursday, had urged his followers to maintain law and order and avoid blocking roads and highways.

In the letter, Rizvi had asked TLP supporters to peacefully go back to their homes and cooperate with law enforcement agencies.

However, some TLP supporters insisted they hear or see the words come from Rizvi himself before stopping.

Meanwhile, some rights activists criticised Friday's social media blackout, warning it could lead to more severe curbs on freedoms.

Editorial: A blanket ban on the TLP is a futile attempt to solve a complex problem

“These arbitrary decisions of blocking and banning have never done any good (and) instead opened ways to blanket bans,” said Nighat Dad, head of the Digital Rights Foundation on Twitter, shortly before the site became inaccessible.

Also on Friday, Sindh Police’s Counter-Terrorism Department initiated action against social media accounts allegedly operated by supporters and workers of the TLP, according to CTD Sindh chief Omar Shahid Hamid.

He said the action was being taken over a host of charges. “The CTD has initiated action against individuals who used social media to incite violence, spread hate and glorify the assaults on law enforcement personnel,” Hamid added.

He revealed that a list of TLP-related social media accounts had been identified and a complaint had been lodged with the FIA’s Cyber Crime Wing.

The CTD in its request to FIA said anti-state and hate speech material was being uploaded by TLP followers on social media platforms ""creating provocations and chaos across the country"".

Government bans TLP under anti-terrorism law

On Thursday, the government had slapped a ban on the TLP. A notification declaring TLP as a proscribed organisation was issued by the Ministry of Interior shortly after the federal cabinet approved a summary to ban the party.

The notification said: “The federal government has reasonable grounds to believe that the TLP is engaged in terrorism, [has] acted in a manner prejudicial to the peace and security of the country, [was] involved in creating anarchy in the country by intimidating the public, caused grievous bodily harm, hurt and death to the personnel of law enforcement agencies and innocent by-standers, attacked civilians and officials, created wide-scale hurdles, threatened, abused and promoted hatred, vandalised and ransacked public and government properties including vehicles and caused arson, blocked essential health supplies to hospitals, and has threatened, coerced, intimidated, and overawed the government [and] the public and created sense of fear and insecurity in the society and the public at large.""

Copies of the notification were sent to authorities concerned, including the secretaries of different ministries and divisions, State Bank governor, Election Commission of Pakistan secretary and director general passports.

The National Counter Terrorism Authority had also swiftly added the TLP to the list of banned terrorist organisations taking the total number of such outfits to 79.

In an effort to keep the ulema in the loop, the religious affairs minister had also hosted an Iftar-dinner in the honour of religious scholars where Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed had briefed them on the reasons for banning the TLP.

REUTERS/Lisi Niesner

Saudi and Iranian officials held direct talks this month in a bid to ease tensions between the two foes, a senior Iranian official and two regional sources said, as Washington works to revive a 2015 nuclear pact with Tehran and end the Yemen war.

The April 9 meeting in Iraq, first reported by the Financial Times on Sunday, did not lead to any breakthrough, the Iranian official and one of the regional sources familiar with the matter said.

The regional source said the meeting focused on Yemen, where a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia has been battling the Iran-aligned Houthi group since March 2015.

""This was a low-level meeting to explore whether there might be a way to ease ongoing tensions in the region,"" the Iranian official said, adding that it was based on Iraq's request.

Iraq's prime minister held talks with Saudi Arabia's crown prince earlier this month and also visited the United Arab Emirates.

The second regional source said the talks also touched on Lebanon, which is facing a political vacuum amid a dire financial crisis. Gulf Arab states are alarmed by the expanding role of Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement.

Saudi authorities did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The FT report said that a senior Saudi official denied there had been any talks with Iran.

Sunni Gulf power Saudi Arabia cut ties with Shi'ite Iran in January 2016 following the storming of its embassy in Tehran in a row over Riyadh's execution of a Shi'ite Muslim cleric.

A Western diplomat in the region said the United States and Britain were informed in advance of the Saudi-Iran talks but had ""not seen the outcome"".

Washington and Tehran are holding indirect talks in Vienna to revive the world powers' nuclear accord with Iran, which former U.S. President Donald Trump quit in 2018. Tehran has breached several nuclear restrictions after Trump reimposed sanctions.

Riyadh last week called for a nuclear deal with stronger parameters and for involvement of Gulf states, which are concerned about Iran's missiles programme and its support for regional proxies.

The United States is also pressing for a ceasefire deal in Yemen which Riyadh and the Saudi-backed Yemeni government have welcomed. The Houthis have yet to accept and have kept up cross border missile and drone attacks on Saudi cities.

A Saudi foreign ministry official told Reuters last week that confidence-building measures could pave the way for expanded nuclear talks with Gulf Arab participation. read more

0,Iran said to ask Interpol to arrest Natanz 'sabotage' suspect,https://www.timesofisrael.com/iran-said-to-ask-interpol-to-arrest-natanz-sabotage-suspect/,"Iran has asked Interpol to help arrest a suspect in an attack on its Natanz nuclear facility which it blames on Israel, a local newspaper reported Sunday.

National television published a photo and identified the man as 43-year-old Reza Karimi, saying the intelligence ministry established his role in last week’s “sabotage” at Natanz.

The broadcaster said the suspect had “fled the country before the incident” and that “legal procedures to arrest and return him to the country are currently underway.”

The report also aired what appeared to be an Interpol “red notice” seeking his arrest. A red notice is a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender or similar legal action, according to Interpol’s website.

Neither state TV nor other media provided further details on the suspect, and the intelligence ministry has not issued an official statement.

The ultra-conservative Kayhan daily reported in its Sunday edition that “intelligence and judicial authorities” are engaged in the process.

It added that “after his identity was established, necessary measures were taken through Interpol to arrest and return” the suspect.

Kayhan did not specify what form of Interpol assistance had been requested.

Contacted by AFP in Lyon, Interpol did not confirm or deny such a request being filed by Iran.

“Interpol does not… comment on specific cases or individuals except in special circumstances and with the approval of the member country concerned,” it said.

As of Sunday noon, Interpol’s public “red notice” list online returned no results for Reza Karimi.

Last year, following an earlier blast at the Natanz site that was also attributed to Israel, Iran named another Karimi as a suspect — Ershad Karimi, a contractor at the nuclear facility who owns a company, MEHR, that supplies precision measuring equipment.

According to Israel’s Channel 13, Ershad Karimi was never found.

The April 11 attack at Natanz was initially described only as a blackout in the electrical grid feeding aboveground workshops and underground enrichment halls, but Iranian officials later began calling it an attack.

On Monday, an Iranian official acknowledged that the blast took out the plant’s main electrical power system and its backup. “From a technical standpoint, the enemy’s plan was rather beautiful,” Fereydoon Abbasi Davani, the head of the Iranian parliament’s energy committee, told Iranian state television.

“They thought about this and used their experts and planned the explosion so both the central power and the emergency power cable would be damaged.”

The New York Times reported that the blast was caused by a bomb that was smuggled into the plant and then detonated remotely. The report cited an unnamed intelligence official, without specifying whether they were American or Israeli. The official also noted that the blast took out Natanz’s primary electrical system as well as its backup.

The Iranian foreign ministry accused Israel of an act of “nuclear terrorism” and vowed revenge.

Israel has neither confirmed nor denied involvement, but public radio reports said it was a sabotage operation by the Mossad spy agency, citing unnamed intelligence sources.

The New York Times, quoting unnamed US and Israeli intelligence officials, also said there had been “an Israeli role” in the attack.

Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman, Saeed Khatibzadeh, last week indirectly accused Israel of attempting to scuttle talks underway in Vienna aimed at reviving a landmark nuclear agreement.

The talks are focused on bringing the US back into the accord after former US president Donald Trump withdrew from it in 2018 and reimposed sanctions on Tehran, and to bring Iran back into compliance with key nuclear commitments it suspended in response to the sanctions.",618,3932,10,61
0,Kosovo’s new president says Serbia must answer for ‘genocide’,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/kosovo-s-new-president-says-serbia-must-answer-for-genocide-1.4537358?mode=amp,"Kosovo intends to sue Serbia for genocide and wants its leaders to atone for crimes committed during a 1998-9 war and for the systematic oppression of Kosovar Albanians that preceded it, the country’s new president has said.

Vjosa Osmani says justice for the 13,000 people killed in the conflict, the one million displaced or expelled and the 1,600 who are still missing, must be the foundation for a long-sought deal to normalise relations with Serbia, which is a condition for both Balkan states to eventually join the European Union.

The US-educated lawyer also accuses her counterpart in Belgrade, Aleksandar Vucic, of sharing the expansionist mindset of Slobodan Milosevic, the nationalist Serbian leader whose belligerence was a catalyst for the wars that destroyed Yugoslavia in the 1990s, and whom he served as information minister.

Osmani’s stance will raise hackles in Serbia, but she says Kosovo is ready to wait years if necessary for a “quality” deal that secures Belgrade’s recognition of Kosovo’s independence without any changes to its current borders.

“Our main job is to speak on behalf of the victims and their families. So the missing persons are our number one priority,” says Osmani, who as a teenager trekked hundreds of kilometres with fellow Kosovars to seek safety from a brutal Serbian crackdown on separatist rebels fighting to end Belgrade’s rule over Kosovo.

“Also war reparations for all the destruction that Serbia caused in Kosovo, and not just during the war but since 1989, when Milosevic came to power and led an apartheid-like system in our country,” she says. “And finally justice, which is a precondition for peace.”

Kosovo’s parliament elected Osmani (38) as president last week, with the backing of prime minister Albin Kurti and his Vetevendosje (Self-Determination) party.

Their alliance in February’s national election and focus on “jobs and justice” for Kosovo’s 1.8 million people secured a landslide victory, and Osmani’s own tally of 300,000 votes has confirmed her status as the nation’s most popular politician.

She says Kosovo’s leaders are now analysing the history of its EU-brokered talks with Serbia, so as to gear future negotiations towards improving the lives of Kosovo’s people and securing “the key component” – mutual recognition between Kosovo and Serbia and their current borders.

“There is no price and no pressure that would make us give up or give in with respect to those principles ... We are going to sit at that table [with Serbia] precisely so we can look in their eyes, so that they can ask for forgiveness for crimes that were committed,” she says.

Claims of genocide She is convinced that those crimes, which she describes as “beyond human imagination”, constitute not only ethnic cleansing but genocide: “The will and intention of Serbia to exterminate, to destroy a people based on their nationality, was clear.”

“So we will be preparing as a country for a genocide case against Serbia as soon as we are ready for that, legally and in terms of the evidence ... The witnesses, most of them are still alive, and the evidence is there and it’s clear-cut,” she said.

Kosovo’s newly elected president, Vjosa Osmani, with her husband and their twin daughters attend the presidential handover ceremony. Photograph: Visar Kryeziu/AP Photo Osmani does not say which court could hear such a case, and legal experts note the difficulty of proving that a state committed genocide.

An international court convicted Bosnian Serb military and political officials of committing genocide against Bosnian Muslims at Srebrenica in 1995, but the United Nations’ highest court ruled that while Serbia had failed in its duty to prevent genocide there, it was not directly responsible for the massacre.

Serbia’s official commemoration of the Kosovo war focuses on Serbian victims of Nato bombing that forced Milosevic to end his crackdown in June 1999, and left Kosovo under UN administration until it declared independence in 2008.

Serbian courts have not launched a significant new trial related to the Kosovo conflict in several years, existing cases are beset by long delays, and Serbs convicted of war crimes by international tribunals are often welcomed home as heroes.

“So when the time comes for the Kosovo delegation to sit with the president of Serbia, our very first question will be: where are our loved ones?” Osmani says of the 1,600 people still missing from the Kosovo war.

Defending Milosevic Vucic has admitted making mistakes in his political past without clearly denouncing Milosevic and his dream of “Greater Serbia”. In 2018, he said Milosevic “was a great Serbian leader whose intentions were certainly for the best, but our results were very poor”.

Vucic and Kosovo’s previous president, Hashim Thaci, were widely reported to have considered a “land swap” as part of a Serbia-Kosovo deal, despite warnings that changing borders in the Balkans could ignite violence. Thaci, who was a leader of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, is now awaiting trial at a war crimes court in the Hague.

Osmani says an exchange of territory is impossible, and believes Vucic “is yet to prove that he has broken away from the past mindset of Milosevic”.

“I think he is pursuing a similar strategy through different means; obviously not through war and destruction and violence but through a different strategy, which still aims at grasping more territories and doesn’t really care about the fate of the people.”

A first meeting with Vucic may be some way off, and Osmani says her current priority is to source Covid-19 vaccines for a country that has received just 24,000 doses.",919,5656,9,61
0,Russia: Prosecutors seek to outlaw Navalny’s activist network,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/16/moscow-prosecutor-seeks-outlaw-navalnys-activist-network,"State prosecutors in Russia have asked a court to label groups linked to jailed opposition leader Alexey Navalny as “extremist organisations”, a move that would ban them and expose activists to long prison terms.

Friday’s move, if approved, would mark one of the most serious steps taken by authorities yet to target the network of groups set up by the staunch critic of President Vladimir Putin who is on a hunger strike as he serves a two and a half year jail term.

Russia’s list of “extremist organisations” currently consists of 33 entities, including the ISIL (ISIS) armed group, the Taliban and Jehovah’s Witnesses. The presence of these groups is banned in Russia and participation in them can result in lengthy prison terms.

People caught organising the activity of such groups can be jailed for up to 10 years, people taking part in them can be held criminally liable and the groups themselves are prohibited from any kind of banking activity.

Prosecutor’s remarks

The Moscow state prosecutor said it had decided to appeal to the court after studying Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation and campaign groups that he has built up in regions across the country.

“Under the guise of liberal slogans, these organisations are engaged in forming the conditions to destabilise the social and social-political situation,” the prosecutor said in a statement.

“Effectively the goal of their activity is to create the conditions to change the basis of the constitutional order, including by using a ‘colour revolution’ scenario,” it said.

An outspoken Putin critic for years, Navalny has organised nationwide street protests and carved out a following online with investigations alleging corruption by senior Russian officials.

The 44-year-old, who was barred from standing for election against Putin in 2018, was jailed in February for parole violations he said were trumped up.

Navalny was arrested at the border as he returned to Russia from Germany where he had been recovering from poisoning by a nerve agent.

Most of his most prominent allies are either abroad or in Russia facing charges for violations relating to a series of demonstrations that were staged to protest against his jailing.

Separately on Friday, a court sentenced a cameraman who worked for Navalny’s team of activists to two years in jail for inciting “extremism”.

The charge related to an anti-government tweet he wrote after the self-immolation of a Russian journalist.

‘Political repression’

Navalny’s allies promised to carry on their work.

“Putin has just announced full-scale mass political repression in Russia,” key aide and head of Navalny’s regional network Leonid Volkov wrote on Twitter shortly after the announcement from prosecutors.

In a statement on Facebook, Volkov and FBK director Ivan Zhdanov said they had no doubts about the ruling that a “Putin’s court” would make but said they will continue their work “peacefully, publicly and effectively”.",468,2956,8,61
0,AMLO to propose extending social programme to Central America,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/18/amlo-to-propose-extending-social-programme-to-central-america,"Mexican president says he wants to propose to Joe Biden to extend aid programme in effort to curb migration to the US.

Mexico’s president has said he plans to propose to his US counterpart Joe Biden a plan to extend to Central America a key Mexican social programme, as part of ongoing efforts to stem migration to the United States.

In a video message on Sunday, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he wants to propose offering the Sembrando Vida programme, which provides work and support for the agricultural sector in Central America.

“What I want to propose is that the program Sembrando Vida is implemented in Central America,” Lopez Obrador said in the video.

“So people aren’t forced to migrate, and it helps the environment.”

Thousands of migrants and asylum seekers from Central America and Mexico have taken often perilous journeys north towards the US in recent years, fuelled by economic hardships, gang violence and natural disasters, among other things.

US officials apprehended more than 172,000 people who had crossed into the country at its southern border with Mexico in March alone.

Many of those who crossed into the US were expelled under a Trump-era policy that effectively sealed the border to most migrants due to the coronavirus pandemic.

But the Biden administration is allowing unaccompanied children into the country, as well as some families – prompting it to deploy additional federal resources to the border and to open additional facilities to house people.

As of Thursday, more than 22,000 children were in US government custody, the Associated Press (AP) news agency reported, including more than 2,500 who were still in substandard facilities run by US border authorities.

“As it currently stands with a lot of these emergency intake sites, children are going in and there’s no way out,” Leecia Welch, the senior director of legal advocacy and child welfare at the National Center for Youth Law, told AP. “They’re complete dead ends.”

Last month, he appointed Vice President Kamala Harris to lead that effort, and she is expected to visit Mexico and Guatemala soon for talks on migration.

A US official said last week that Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras had agreed to deploy troops to their borders in an effort to stem the flow of migration.

“We’ve secured agreements for them to put more troops on their own border,” Tyler Moran, a special assistant to Biden for immigration policy, told the MSNBC news outlet.

Meanwhile, Lopez Obrador said on Sunday that he believed the Sembrando Vida programme could create thousands of jobs across southern Mexico and the Central American countries.",490,3015,9,61

Enlarge this image toggle caption Ramon Espinosa/AP Ramon Espinosa/AP

A generation of Cuban revolutionaries who seized power more than six decades ago, directly challenging the U.S. and later pushing Washington and Moscow to the brink of nuclear war, is set to exit the stage.

At a party conference that started Friday, 89-year-old Raúl Castro, the brother of the late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro, said he will step down as head of the Cuban Communist Party. Three years ago, he resigned the presidency and handed the reins to a much younger Miguel Mario Díaz-Canel Bermúdez.

The move, at Cuba's Eighth Party Congress, will mark the first time since the 1959 communist revolution that a Castro will not hold one of the most powerful roles in Cuba's government.

It also comes on the symbolic 60th anniversary of the failed Bay of Pigs, a CIA-led operation to use Cuban exiles in an invasion that sought to overthrow the communist regime. The following year, American spy planes discovered evidence that Soviet-supplied, nuclear-armed missiles were being installed on the island — leading to a showdown between the U.S. and the Soviet Union that many historians regard as the closest the superpowers ever came to a full-scale conflict.

But those events will likely dim as the country's ""historic generation,"" as many Cubans refer to the old guard, also fade. On Friday, Castro's longtime deputy, 90-year-old José Ramón Machado Ventura, is also expected to step down, leaving the 17-member Politburo without any revolutionary veterans.

Many Cubans who don't remember a time when a Castro wasn't running their daily affairs are nervous about the future, especially since the transition comes as the country appears to be at a crossroads.

Following the end of the Cold War, Moscow's patronage all but dried up, leaving Cuba to find new benefactors. After a glimmer of rapprochement between Havana and Washington during the Obama administration, the Trump White House did an about-face, imposing U.S. sanctions.

The sanctions — together with the loss of support from Venezuela and spiraling inflation — has brought a return to food shortages not seen since the 1990s. More recently, the isolated communist government has had to face the coronavirus pandemic, which, among other things, has meant going it alone on vaccine development.

President Biden has said he wants a reset on Cuba policy but so far has offered few details on how his administration will handle the perennially thorny issue.

After Raúl Castro took over for his brother in 2008, he brought big economic changes to the island – expanding private enterprise, ushering in the use of cellphones, allowing access to the Internet and seeking more relaxed relations with the United States.

But since then, reforms have mostly stalled, said Ted Henken, a Cuba specialist at Baruch College in New York.

The government, he said, is ""very cautious because they know that economic freedom can lead to political freedom and loss of political control.""

Authorities have also failed to overhaul bloated state-run companies and government agencies that most of the population rely on for income.

""Laying off a lot of people could lead to social and political problems,"" William LeoGrande, an American University expert on Cuba, told The Associated Press.

LeoGrande also points to growing inequality in a system that promised Cubans precisely the opposite.

""Back in 1990s, there was a sense that we're all in this together,"" he said. ""Today, the inequality is not only worse, but it's also more manifest.""

The island's economy contracted 11% last year, even as Díaz-Canel broadened private enterprise, allowing Cubans to run almost any small business from their homes for the first time.

The economic disarray is spurring political discontent, with historic protests in Cuba, fueled in large part by the access to information from the outside world via the Internet. The emergence of a new artist revolt, started by Afro-Cuban rappers before widening to mainstream artists, is particularly astonishing.

Despite the unease, there are no signs that the end of the Castro era brings Cuba any closer to the end of communist rule, said Arturo Lopez-Levy, a Cuba expert at Holy Names University in California.

""This is not a family business; it is more sophisticated and more resilient than a government that is part of a same clan or a family,"" he said.",725,4483,11,61

REUTERS/Diego Vara

Brazil's hospitals were running out of drugs needed to sedate COVID-19 patients on Thursday, with the government urgently seeking to import supplies amid reports of the seriously ill being tied down and intubated without effective sedatives.

Health Minister Marcelo Queiroga said Brazil was in talks with Spain and other countries to secure the emergency drugs. Hospitals, he added, were also struggling to get enough oxygen.

The scenes playing out across Brazil, one of the countries hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, are placing growing international pressure on President Jair Bolsonaro.

Aid group Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said Brazil's ""failed response"" had led to thousands of avoidable deaths and created a humanitarian catastrophe that could still get worse.

Brazil has recorded a total of 361,884 coronavirus deaths - only the United States has more - and 13,673,507 confirmed cases.

More Brazilians are currently dying of the virus each day than anywhere else in the world, with South America's largest country reporting another 3,560 deaths on Thursday. Bolsonaro has opposed lockdowns and held large events in which he often does not wear a mask. He has only recently embraced vaccines as a possible solution.

Brazil's hospitals are struggling to cope.

Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo have both sounded the alarm over shortages of sedatives, with Sao Paulo's Health Secretary saying the city's ability to care for seriously ill COVID-19 patients is on the verge of collapse.

""I never thought that I would be living through something like this after 20 years working in intensive care,"" Aureo do Carmo Filho, an ICU doctor in Rio, told Reuters.

""Using mechanical restraints without sedatives is bad practice ... the patient is submitted to a form of torture,"" he said.

Seriously ill COVID-19 patients struggling for breath are sedated in order to put them on ventilators, an intrusive practice the body can naturally resist.

With ICU beds at or near capacity across the country, hospitals are being forced to create improvised intensive care beds which often lack equipment or professional expertise.

Globo television network on Wednesday reported cases from a Rio hospital in which patients were intubated with a lack of sedatives, tied to beds.

The Albert Schweitzer hospital, through the press office of the city of Rio which runs it, said there was a shortage of intubation drugs but that substitutes were being used to ensure medical assistance was not compromised. It said mechanical restraints were only used when prescribed by a doctor.

The city of Rio added that a batch of intubation drugs was set to arrive on Thursday.

Sao Paulo blamed the shortage on the federal government.

""The irresponsibility and neglect of Brazilian lives is unbelievable,"" Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria said on Twitter.

""FAILED RESPONSE""

Médecins Sans Frontières said Bolsonaro's government had not done enough to prevent the tragedy.

""More than one year into the COVID-19 pandemic, the failed response in Brazil has caused a humanitarian catastrophe,"" said Christos Christou, a medical doctor and president of MSF, called Doctors Without Borders in English.

""Each week there is a grim new record of deaths and infections - the hospitals are overflowing and yet there is still no coordinated centralized response,"" Christou said in a briefing with reporters, adding that the situation was expected to become even worse in the weeks ahead.

Bolsonaro has openly fought against state and local governments seeking to institute lockdowns, saying Brazilians need to get on with normal life and that job losses are more dangerous than the virus.

MSF Director-General Meinie Nicolai said the surge in cases cannot be blamed only on the contagious Brazilian COVID-19 variant, known as P.1.

""The P.1 variant is certainly a problem, but this doesn't explain the situation in Brazil,"" she said.

Opponents of Myanmar's junta on Friday announced the formation of a national unity government, which includes ousted lawmakers, members of ethnic minority groups and figures in the anti-coup protest, according to a video statement read out on Public Voice Television.

The announcement was made on the Facebook page of the opposition Public Voice Television, which posted a video statement by veteran Myanmar democracy activist, Min Ko Naing.

""Please welcome the people's government,"" said Min Ko Naing said in a 10-address in Burmese.

A second post named the heads of 15 senior posts in the national unity administration with the country's deposed president, U Win Myint, and detained opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi retaining their pre-coup posts.

It also named heads of various ministries in opposition, from defence and home affairs (interior ministry) to a ""ministry of international cooperation"".

In a Twitter post, the unity government's minister of international cooperation, Dr Sasa, who goes by one name, said he had ""humbly accepted"" the responsibility of his new post.

Statement by Dr. Sasa

I am proud to have been asked to serve as the Union Minister of International Cooperation and as Spokesperson for the National Unity Government of Myanmar . I have humbly accepted this responsibility.

We will prevail pic.twitter.com/xP0pCBz48t — Dr. Sasa (@DrSasa22222) April 16, 2021

In his address, Min Ko Naing said the will of the people was the unity government's priority, while acknowledging the scale of the task at hand.

""We're trying to get this out from the roots so we have to sacrifice a lot,"" he said, referring to the junta.

An unhappy union

The February 1 coup in Myanmar has opened an unexpected window of opportunity for the various ethnic rebel outfits, which have no loyalty to either the junta or to Suu Kyi to unite in opposition to the army's rule.

>> Read more: Myanmar ethnic groups unite in fight against army

Stretching from the tropical coastal lowlands of the Bay of Bengal to temperate mountain ranges bordering China, Myanmar is one of the world’s most ethnically diverse countries. But the dominant Bamar ethnic group has long marginalised minority ethnic groups, many of them based in border ares.

Myanmar has 133 officially recognised minority ethnic groups – as well as other groups, such as the Rohingyas, that are not officially recognised.

For many ethnic minorities, Suu Kyi's administration has been more foe than friend.

While each ethnic armed group has its own demands, all want a version of federalism, giving them at least some measure of self-governance.

Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy (NLD) once offered them that in exchange for electoral support, but ethnic community leaders say little came of it.

""The Bamar majority have given such a promise from time to time, without it materialising,"" Khu Oo Reh of the Karenni National Progressive Party (KNPP), told AFP.

Silent strike

While the politicians were announcing the unity government, other opponents of military rule observed a ""silent strike"" staying home to mourn those killed or wearing black in small marches in several cities and towns.

Streets in the main city of Yangon were largely deserted, residents said, while black-clad protesters held small rallies in half a dozen cities and towns, media reported.

There were no immediate reports of violence but overnight, two people were shot and killed in the central town of Myingyan, Radio Free Asia reported.

The military has also been rounding up its critics and has published the names of more than 200 people wanted under a law that makes it illegal to encourage mutiny or dereliction of duty in the armed forces.

Two prominent protest organisers were arrested on Thursday along with an actor and singer, both known for speaking out against the coup.

In another show of defiance, a previously unknown group called the Ayeyarwaddy Federal Army said on Facebook it aimed to fight the military to restore an elected government and protect the people and it called for volunteers.

It gave no details about how it aimed to take on the well-equipped and experienced army.

The turmoil has alarmed Myanmar's neighbours in Southeast Asia, who have been trying to encourage talks between the rival sides.

Southeast Asian leaders will meet in Indonesia on April 24 to discuss the situation, Thai and Indonesian media reported. Junta leader Senior General Min Aung Hlaing was due to attend, a Thai broadcaster said, but the Jakarta Post said it had not been confirmed whether the summit would include representatives of the junta or the former government.

Sasa however said ASEAN should not invite ""murderer-in-chief"" Min Aung Hlaing to the summit.

0,Tens of thousands flee attacks on northeast Nigerian town: UN,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/16/thousands-flee-attacks-on-northeast-nigerian-town-un,"UN says tens of thousands have fled a series of attacks this week by an armed group on the town of Damasak, Borno state.

As many as 65,000 people have fled the northeastern Nigerian town of Damasak following a series of attacks by an armed group, the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) said.

Fighters from the so-called Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) stormed the town in Borno state three times in a week to strike a military garrison, burning homes and a UN office, and killing at least 12 people, the UNHCR said on Friday.

In the latest violence on Wednesday, the fighters attacked the garrison before being forced back into the town itself, military sources and residents said.

“Following the latest attack on Wednesday 14 April, the third in seven days, up to 80 percent of the town’s population – which includes the local community and internally displaced people – were forced to flee,” UNHCR spokesman Babar Baloch said.

Some have fled towards the regional capital, Maiduguri, and other nearby towns while others have crossed the border into Niger’s Diffa region, itself vulnerable to violence from armed groups.

“Due to insecurity, however, humanitarian access is increasingly challenging in many parts of Nigeria’s Borno State, including for UNHCR staff, who were forced to temporarily relocate out of Damasak in the past seven days,” Baloch said.

Jens Laerke, spokesman for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), told the same briefing that aid operations had been temporarily suspended in the area since Sunday because of the insecurity.

“The situation on the ground is extremely critical and if this continues it will be impossible, maybe for longer periods of time, for us to deliver aid to those who desperately need it,” he said.

Laerke added that humanitarian workers appeared to be targets, amid reports of house-to-house searches for aid workers and the burning of their offices.

The incidents mark the latest violence in the Lake Chad basin area which in recent years has uprooted some 3.3 million people, the refugee agency said.

Damasak is host to one of the military’s so-called “super camps” – fortified garrisons the army has set up in an attempt to better defend against attacks.

Critics and residents say the strategy to close smaller bases and pull back into larger camps has left armed groups freer to roam unchallenged in rural areas.

Due to worsening security in the region, humanitarian workers are struggling to provide aid, with the number of people requiring urgent assistance expected to rise to 8.7 million this year.

0,Democrats call on Biden to stop Saudi Arabia’s Yemen blockade,https://www.vox.com/2021/4/9/22375381/saudi-arabia-yemen-blockade-biden-letter,"Saudi Arabia is continuing its six-year air and sea blockade of Yemen, starving millions of Yemenis and deepening the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.

Anger from Democrats and progressives in the US isn’t just directed at Riyadh, though. It’s also aimed at the Biden administration for failing to fully pressure Saudi Arabia to lift the restrictions.

When Saudi Arabia and its allies launched a war against the Houthis in 2015 — with US support — Saudi used its military to block planes from landing and ships from docking in Yemen, saying such measures were necessary to stop the Houthis from smuggling in weapons, including from Iran.

The Saudi coalition is fighting to oust the Houthi rebels, who overthrew the internationally recognized government of President Abdrabbuh Mansur al-Hadi in 2015, and return al-Hadi, who currently lives in exile in Saudi Arabia, to power.

But critics warned the blockade would keep much-needed food, fuel, medicine, and humanitarian aid from reaching desperate Yemenis, including millions of children, who are caught in the middle of the fighting.

That concern proved devastatingly prophetic.

The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, the world’s top authority on food security, said last year that 47,000 Yemenis were suffering from famine-like conditions and that more than 16 million — over half of Yemen’s population — couldn’t reliably and adequately feed themselves. Multiple United Nations agencies have said that at least 400,000 Yemeni children could die this year alone if conditions don’t improve.

In early February, President Joe Biden promised the US would stop supporting the Saudi-led coalition’s offensive operations in the war. But, he added, “We’re going to continue to support and help Saudi Arabia defend its sovereignty and its territorial integrity and its people.”

Some analysts believe Riyadh took that as implicit support for the blockade, even as the Biden administration has consistently expressed the free flow of fuel and goods into Yemen is “critical.”

That may partly explain why Saudi Arabia has kept the restrictions in place. In March, for instance, CNN found that Saudi warships had kept all oil tankers from docking in the Houthi-controlled port of Hodeidah since the start of the year.

“The Saudi vessels that patrol the waters of Hodeidah have control over which commercial ships can dock and unload their cargo,” CNN reported. “Some goods are getting through — CNN witnessed aid being loaded on to trucks at the port after being delivered by ship — but not any fuel to deliver them.”

Now, Democrats want Biden to push Riyadh to end the blockade once and for all. Nearly 80 Democrats made that clear in a Tuesday letter to the president.

“We ask you to take additional steps to publicly pressure Saudi Arabia to lift this blockade immediately, unilaterally, and comprehensively,” wrote the lawmakers, including Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the House Intelligence Committee chair. Among other things, they want the Saudis to “[guarantee] that humanitarian and commercial imports can freely enter Yemen” and “[ensure] that and crossings for commercial and civilian traffic are permanently opened.”

“Every day that we wait for these issues to be resolved in negotiations is another day that pushes more children to the brink of death,” the letter added.

It’s unclear if the White House will listen to their plea. The Biden administration’s current approach toward the conflict is to try to broker a peace deal between the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis. Some progressive activists accuse the president and his team of wanting to keep the blockade in place to serve as a bargaining chip in negotiations.

“They support the blockade currently,” said Erik Sperling, executive director of Just Foreign Policy, a progressive foreign policy group. “The administration would only want it lifted as part of a comprehensive agreement.”

Other analysts disagree. “That’s hyperbolic,” said Seth Binder, an advocacy officer at the Project on Middle East Democracy (POMED) in Washington, DC, noting that Biden’s team restarted humanitarian funding for northern Yemen cut by the Trump administration and repeated calls for open trade.

Still, Binder said the president and his aides “could and should be sharpening their rhetoric” toward Saudi Arabia about ending the blockade.

Biden will continue to face pressure over the Saudi blockade

Days after CNN’s March report exposing the disastrous effects of the blockade, Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud proposed to reopen the airport in the Yemeni capital of Sana’a and allow food and fuel imports at Hodeidah.

“The initiative will take effect as soon as the Houthis agree to it,” the minister said. It was the first time Riyadh openly acknowledged carrying out a deliberate blockade in Yemen.

Hodeidah is vitally important to Yemen’s economy. It’s the country’s largest and most important port, and it’s crucial to the nation’s trade and taxation efforts, said Shamiran Mako, an assistant professor at Boston University.

But the Houthis almost immediately rejected the Saudi plan, saying it didn’t fully lift the long-imposed restrictions. “Opening the airports and seaports is a humanitarian right and should not be used as a pressure tool,” said Mohammed Abdulsalam, the Houthis’ chief negotiator. The Houthis, however, are also known to divert aid away from the population and to their own officials, supporters, and fighters.

Since then, the Saudi-led coalition has allowed at least four fuel ships in Hodeidah’s port, even as Riyadh has gone back to denying restrictions exist.

“There is no blockade,” the Saudi foreign minister told CNN in an interview this week, saying that 67 ships had docked in Hodeidah over the last three months and that the flow of goods continues at other crossings.

But experts say that’s still not enough to ease the humanitarian crisis. And they say Saudi Arabia won’t change its tune unless the Biden administration exerts significant pressure.

One way it could do that, POMED’s Binder said, is to threaten to further downgrade the US-Saudi relationship if such restrictions persist. “That gives the administration the most leverage” throughout the diplomatic process. For example, the US could further restrict arms sales to the kingdom or curtail economic ties.

Meanwhile, pressure from Democrats and activists has become more visible. Activists from Detroit and Dearborn, Michigan, have been on a hunger strike for more than 10 days, calling for an end to the blockade. Their effort has the support of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), who joined one of the striking activists, 26-year-old Iman Saleh, outside the White House for a press conference on Friday. It was Saleh’s 12th day without food.

Between the letter from lawmakers and increased activity from anti-blockade activists, it looks like Biden will continue to face criticism on the issue.

“Democrats are starting to get concerned and wanting to push the administration more,” Binder told me. “The honeymoon phase is coming to an end.”",1122,7100,10,61
0,Some experts fear next-generation Covid vaccines may be worse,https://www.statnews.com/2021/04/16/next-generation-covid-19-vaccines-are-supposed-to-be-better-some-experts-worry-they-could-be-worse/,"Next-generation Covid-19 vaccines are supposed to be better. Some experts worry they could be worse

With Covid-19 vaccines, the world hopes to beat back the virus that causes the disease. But some scientists are increasingly concerned that, because of a quirk of our own biology, future iterations of the vaccines might not always be quite as effective as they are today.

The concerns stem from a phenomenon that is known as imprinting, sometimes called original antigenic sin, which is believed to affect how we respond to some pathogens.

In short, when your body is introduced to a particular threat for the first time — either through infection or a vaccine — that encounter sets your immune system’s definition of that virus and what immune weapons it needs to detect and protect against it in the future.

advertisement

That imprint can be helpful. In the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, elderly adults were protected by immune responses they’d generated more than half a century earlier, in childhood, through encounters with a related virus. But it can also interfere with your body’s ability to mount responses against strains that have evolved from the one you were first exposed to.

In the case of Covid, some scientists are concerned that the immune system’s reaction to the vaccines being deployed now could leave an indelible imprint, and that next-generation products, updated in response to emerging variants of the SARS-CoV-2, won’t confer as much protection.

advertisement

Michael Worobey, who was been involved in groundbreaking research on imprinting with influenza, said he worries the responses to first-generation Covid-19 vaccines will prove to be “a high-water mark” for people’s immune responses to these inoculations.

Newsletters Sign up for Daily Recap A roundup of STAT's top stories of the day. Please enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy Leave this field empty if you're human:

“I do think it’s something that we need to be thinking about,” Worobey, a professor of evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona, told STAT. “We might actually see lower efficacy five years from now, if people are still locked into recalling the response to the first [SARS-2] antigen that they saw.”

Sarah Cobey, an associate professor of computational biology at the University of Chicago, shares his worry. “As long as we have competition between old antibody responses and new antibody responses … then it seems like exactly the right sort of environment to see these phenomena,” Cobey said.

“I can’t think of a reason that should be restricted to influenza,” she added.

Not everyone in the conversation is convinced there will be a problem, though.

Vineet Menachery is a coronavirus expert at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, one of the smallish community of researchers who were studying coronaviruses before the Covid-19 pandemic hit. He noted that the SARS-2 spike protein — the protein that projects from the virus’ surface, giving it the appearance of wearing a crown — doesn’t have as much wiggle room to change as the hemagglutinin proteins that sit atop of flu viruses.

Both the spike and the hemagglutinin proteins are the means by which their respective viruses attach to the cells they are trying to infect; in the case of SARS-2 viruses, attachment occurs via a receptor known as ACE2. But influenza viruses mutate at a far faster rate than coronaviruses and they have much more leeway to change — mutational space, Menachery called it — without impeding its functionality.

“The changes that we see in the [SARS-2] variants aren’t whole-hog changes,” he said.

Imprinting is one of the reasons why flu vaccines aren’t as protective as we’d like them to be. Flu is a notorious shape-shifter and its constant alterations allow influenza viruses to evade immune system protections generated by either vaccination or previous infections. People who first encountered H1N1 viruses, for instance, never get as much protection from the H3N2 component of a flu shot as they do from the H1N1 part.

“Basically, I think of original antigenic sin as some sort of hierarchy in immune memory, meaning you preferentially boost what you’ve seen before, at the expense of developing responses to the new stuff,” Cobey said. “It could impact the effectiveness of [Covid] vaccine going forward.”

Scott Hensley, a sometimes collaborator of Cobey’s, has actually seen some evidence of coronavirus imprinting in his research. An associate professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania, Hensley and colleagues were working to develop Covid-19 antibody tests in the early days of the pandemic. The work involved studying using blood samples from people who contracted Covid. They compared the post-infection samples to blood drawn from the same individuals prior to the pandemic.

In comparing the before and after blood samples, they saw in the post-infection sample a “dramatic” rise in antibodies to one of the humans coronaviruses that is among the causes of the common cold. It was a virus called OC43, which is in the same coronavirus family as SARS-2, as well as the viruses that cause SARS and MERS.

In other words, Covid infection actually boosted the immune system’s protection against a different virus, one that the immune system already knew.

Still, Hensley isn’t worried about imprinting — or at least not among people who have been vaccinated with mRNA vaccines. The very strong immune response generated by the Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines should override any imprinting impacts as SARS-2 mutates, he said. Hensley worries, though, that people whose immunity to the virus comes from infection, not vaccination, might have more difficulty handling variant viruses because of imprinting effects.

David Topham, an immunologist at the University of Rochester Medical Center and director of the New York Influenza Center of Excellence, also envisages that possibility.

He noted that, in the earliest stages of SARS-2 infection, the immune system mounts a response to a portion of the spike protein called S2. Later, the immune system focuses its attention on other parts of the spike, notably the part of the protein that attaches the virus to cells it invades, known as the receptor binding domain.

It’s not yet known if the early focus on S2 — which doesn’t change much from virus to virus — will blind the immune system to the changes elsewhere in the spike protein, the changes updated vaccines would be trying to teach the immune system to respond to, Topham said.

Topham doesn’t think this will be a problem in vaccinated people, because of the way the vaccines in use have been designed. The spike proteins they trigger production of appear to hide the S2 region, he said. The immune system can’t fixate on something it doesn’t see.

For people whose immunity comes from infection, Topham sees three possible scenarios. “It can be a problem, because the immune cells specific for S2 outcompete immune cells against other components of the spike protein that you really need in order to get protection. It can be inconsequential in that eventually the responses to the other parts of the protein catch up and it doesn’t matter. Or it could actually be a benefit because it gets the immune system revved up more quickly.”

Topham is not alone in speculating that an original Covid vaccine with a booster targeting variant viruses could, in fact, lead to a stronger immune response.

“You might actually end up with an immune response that is broader,” said Florian Krammer, a professor of vaccinology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.

Krammer used as an example research done by scientists at the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare and University of Turku on vaccination against H5N1 bird flu. H5N1 vaccine that don’t contain adjuvants — boosting compounds — appear to generate poor immune responses. But in a paper published in the journal Vaccine, the researchers reported that a priming and boosting regimen that used two different H5N1 vaccines, made with different strains of the virus, induced a strong and long-lasting response.

We may find out whether this is going to be a problem sooner than you’d think. Moderna is working with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases — which helped it design its original Covid vaccine — to test an updated version of its vaccine that targets the variant first spotted in South Africa, B.1.351. That variant appears to be able to evade immune responses triggered by earlier versions of the virus.

“The Phase 1 studies conducted by Moderna and NIAID … will produce immunogenicity data that will address this question,” John Mascola, director of NIAID’s Vaccine Research Center, told STAT in an email. “So data directly bearing on the question will be forthcoming over the next weeks and months.”",1447,8894,9,61
0,Russia to close parts of Black Sea near Crimea for six months,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/16/russia-to-close-parts-of-black-sea-near-crimea-for-six-months,"Ukraine and the EU condemn Russia’s decision to restrict the navigation of foreign military and official ships.

Russia will restrict the navigation of foreign military and official ships in parts of the Black Sea until October, according to a Russian news agency, prompting swift condemnation by Ukraine and the European Union.

The announcement on Friday comes amid tensions between Moscow and Kyiv that have escalated in recent weeks after an uptick in fighting between Ukraine’s army and pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine.

Russia has massed its troops along Ukraine’s northern and eastern borders and on the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014. This week Russia also conducted navy drills in the Black Sea.

“From 21:00 on April 24 until 21:00 on October 31, passage through the territorial sea of the Russian Federation for foreign military ships and other state vessels will be halted,” the state-run RIA Novosti news agency cited a defence ministry statement as saying on Friday.

The restrictions will affect the western tip of Crimea, the peninsula’s southern coastline from Sevastopol to Hurzuf, and a “rectangle” off the Kerch peninsula near the Opuksky Nature Reserve.

A senior EU official described the move as a “highly worrying development”.

The move contradicts norms of free maritime passage and international law and adds to tensions around “the military buildup on the other side of the Russian border with Ukraine”, the official told the AFP news agency.

Rising tensions

The official said that the restrictions would increase tensions as Russia was “taking unilateral measures on an international space”.

One of the areas affected by Russia’s restrictions is located near the Kerch Strait, which connects the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov and is of crucial importance for the export of grain and steel from Ukraine.

The Kerch Strait became a scene of confrontation in 2018 after Russia seized three Ukrainian ships there over alleged violations of its territorial waters.

Ukraine had been free to navigate the Kerch Strait along with Russia until 2014, when Moscow claimed full control of the waterway after annexing Crimea.

The Kerch Strait is also the site of a costly 19-km (12-mile) bridge connecting Crimea with mainland Russia that Moscow opened in 2018.

Ukraine’s foreign ministry on Thursday criticised the navigation restrictions, which were initially reported without specifics earlier this week, as a “usurpation of the sovereign rights of Ukraine”.

It also stressed that under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, “Russia must neither obstruct nor halt transit through the international strait to ports in the Sea of Azov.”",428,2702,12,61

REUTERS/Yara Nardi

Undertakers protested on Friday against a massive backlog of coffins building up at Rome cemeteries, saying city authorities were failing to cope with a surge of coronavirus deaths.

Funeral directors said more than 2,000 bodies were being stored at Rome's sole crematorium, which can handle around 50 cremations a day, while mortuary rooms at other cemeteries were packed, awaiting burial or interment.

Some bodies have been in storage since the start of the year, they said.

""Every few days we are told the cemeteries are blocked and they haven't got any more room to take in the dead,"" said Giovanni Caciolli, head of Italy's federation of funeral workers.

In a statement earlier this week, the city council company that handles burials and cremations, AMA, acknowledged that it was facing an unprecedented situation and was working to create 60,000 new burial plots for the city.

""AMA is doing its utmost to deal with a steadily increasing number of deaths,"" it said.

It said the city had registered 4,763 more deaths between October 2020 and March 2021 than in the same months of 2019/2020, with the rising trend continuing into April.

Italy has reported 116,000 coronavirus-related deaths so far. The majority have been in northern Italy, but in recent months the virus has claimed a growing number of victims in central and southern Italy.

Funeral directors say hearses face lengthy queues at city cemeteries as they await workers to log and store the coffins.

A video obtained by Reuters showed large refrigerated containers parked outside the Prima Porta cemetery. Workers said the containers were being used to hold coffins.

Protesters on Friday laid funeral wreaths in front of the Temple of Hercules, close to Rome city hall.

""Sorry, they don't allow us to bury your loved ones,"" funeral homes wrote on the wreaths.

Earlier this week a local man plastered huge posters across the city apologising to his mother, who died in early March but whose body is still stuck in storage. ""I am sorry mum that I've not been able to have you buried yet,"" the posters say.

Opposition politicians say the crisis could have been averted if the city had heeded warnings in 2017 that it needed to modernise and develop the crematorium.

0,‘Frightening’: Weekend shutdown in Delhi as COVID grips India,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/17/frightening-weekend-shutdown-in-delhi-as-covid-grips-india,"India faces a ferocious new coronavirus wave with more than 234,000 new cases on Saturday – the eighth record high increase in nine days.

New Delhi went into a weekend lockdown on Saturday as India faces a ferocious new coronavirus wave, with daily cases hitting another record increase of 234,692 nationwide and families clamouring for drugs and hospital beds.

The health ministry said the latest number is the eighth record high in the last nine days.

Total cases have gone past 14.5 million, second only to the United States which has reported more than 32 million infections.

India’s deaths from COVID-19 rose by 1,341 to reach a total of 175,649, the data showed.

Hopes that South Asian countries might have beaten the pandemic have been dashed with India seeing more than two million new cases this month alone and Bangladesh and Pakistan imposing shutdowns.

India’s per-capita rates remain low by international comparison, raising the prospect that infection numbers – fuelled possibly by a virulent new “double mutant” – may explode further.

After a national lockdown a year ago led to hundreds of deaths and one of the worst slumps of any major economy, the Indian government is desperate to avoid a second stoppage.

Many states are, however, clamping down, including hotspot Maharashtra, industry-heavy Gujarat and IT hub Bangalore’s home state Karnataka, although restrictions are less onerous than last year.

Uttar Pradesh state, home to some 240 million people, on Friday announced that all villages and cities would be under lockdown for one day on Sunday.

In the capital, New Delhi, which has overtaken Mumbai as the worst-hit Indian city, restaurants, malls, gyms and spas were closed for the weekend.

'Genome sequencing data have presented evidence of the 'double mutant' in 61% of samples in Maharashtra. But whether this new variant is driving India's ongoing surge can be said only after more data is available.'https://t.co/ptawnuMq9J – @runaanu — Amit Paranjape (@aparanjape) April 16, 2021

Weddings though are permitted with guests limited to 50, while a maximum of 20 people can attend funerals. Movie theatres can open with one-third capacity.

“Don’t panic. All essential services will be available through the weekend,” the city of 25 million people’s chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said.

Holy dip

Similarly, the northern state of Uttarakhand has restricted gatherings to 200 people – but exempted the vast ongoing Hindu festival Kumbh Mela.

The gathering in Haridwar has attracted as many as 25 million people since January, including some 4.6 million this week alone, with most people ignoring COVID-19 guidelines.

One seer on Thursday died from the virus and 80 other holy men have tested positive, and experts fear that the millions of devotees will now take the virus back to their home towns and villages.

Election rallies are also going ahead in the eastern state of West Bengal, with Home Minister Amit Shah attending two roadshows and one public meeting on Friday alone.

In state capital Kolkata, railway employee Samaresh Tapna fell sick after attending one such gathering and was hospitalised.

“I felt angry with myself … I cursed my fate,” the 42-year-old told AFP.

Running short of oxygen

Hospitals are running short of oxygen and coronavirus medicines, such as remdesivir, prompting desperate people to pay exorbitant rates on the black market.

Social media is full of horror stories of desperate calls to help a loved one needing hospital treatment for COVID-19 or other complaints.

“I lost a cousin on Saturday. He was not admitted after a stroke. Tried 4 hospitals,” read one message on a Delhi neighbourhood WhatsApp group this week.

“Last year, there were practically no children presenting symptoms,” said Khusrav Bajan, a consultant at Mumbai’s PD Hinduja National Hospital.

India’s drive to vaccinate its 1.3 billion people has also hit obstacles, with just 117 million shots administered so far and stocks running low, according to some local authorities.

“[It is] understandable that many people are sick of the restrictions and want to resume normal life. We must redouble our efforts to contain this disease as too many lives are at stake,” said Udaya Regmi from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).

“This is a wake-up call to the world. Vaccines must be available to everyone, everywhere, rich and poor to overcome this terrible pandemic,” Regmi said in a statement, calling the surge across South Asia “truly frightening”.",774,4815,9,61
0,Head of Tokyo Olympics again says games will not be cancelled,https://winnipeg.citynews.ca/2021/04/16/head-of-tokyo-olympics-again-says-games-will-not-be-cancelled/,"TOKYO — The head of the Tokyo Olympics on Friday was again forced to assure the world that the postponed games will open in just over three months and not be cancelled despite surging COVID-19 cases in Japan.

Organizing committee President Seiko Hashimoto was asked at a news conference if there were any conditions under which the Olympics would be cancelled.

The questions come as the general secretary of ruling LDP political party and the No. 2 in charge, Toshihiro Nikai, raised the possibility the day before.

“There are a variety of concerns but as the Tokyo 2020 organizing committee we are not thinking about cancelling the games,” Hashimoto said.

Nikai was asked on Thursday in an interview if cancellation was still an option.

“Of course,” he replied, adding that if the Olympics caused a surge in infections “there would be no meaning to having the Olympics.”

Nikai tried to backtrack later, and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga issued a statement Thursday saying there is “no change to the government position to do everything to achieve safe and secure Olympics.”

Hashimoto acknowledged Nikai’s concern and suggested it was probably shared by the Japanese public. Polls show as many as 80% in Japan oppose holding the Olympics during the pandemic.

“The fact that he (Nikai) is concerned is a point that we need to take seriously as Tokyo 2020,” she said. “His comment has reminded us of how tedious it was for us to feel confident or be fully prepared for delivering the games.”

COVID-19 cases have been rising across Japan. Despite this, the International Olympic Committee and Tokyo organizers are pressing on. The IOC has seen its income stalled by the postponement, and Japan has already invested about least $15 billion to organize these Olympics.

On Thursday, Japan’s second-largest metropolitan area of Osaka recorded 1,208 new cases. It was the third straight day that new cases surpassed 1,000. Tokyo hit 729, its highest total in more than two months.

Japan has attributed 9,500 death to COVID-19, good by world standards but poor by results in Asia. Vaccine rollout in Japan has also been very slow with fewer than 1% having received the vaccine.

The national government on Friday was set to add four more prefectures to those already under a “quasi-state of emergency.” This bring the total to 10 and now includes Tokyo neighbours Kanagawa, Chiba, and Saitama.

0,Backlash hits mascot designed to sell Fukushima water release,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/04/15/national/fukushima-tritium-mascot/,"A mascot launched by the Japanese government to coincide with its decision to release treated water from the inactive Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant into the ocean has become the target of criticism by local residents, with many saying it is out of sync with the reality of the situation.

The Reconstruction Agency on Tuesday released a flyer and video on its website featuring the radioactive substance tritium as a cute character to dispel concerns about the government’s decision, but they were removed Wednesday night following the criticism.

“Nuclear power plants are highly specialized and difficult to understand. We want many people to take an interest in them,” said an agency official, adding the mascot would be redesigned in line with the views of the public.

According to the official, advertising giant Dentsu Inc., which was contracted by the agency for the campaign, commissioned an illustrator to create the mascot.

The Japanese government decided Tuesday to release treated radioactive water from Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc.’s Fukushima plant into the Pacific Ocean from 2023.

The water is being treated using an advanced liquid processing system (ALPS), which removes most radioactive materials including strontium and cesium but leaves behind tritium, an isotope of hydrogen said to pose little health risk in low concentrations.

In the flyers and video, the character explains that ocean release of water containing tritium is standard practice at nuclear power plants around the world.

“It seems the government’s desire to release the water into the sea takes priority over everything. We fishermen can’t understand it,” said Katsuo Watanabe, an 82-year-old fisherman from Iwaki, Fukushima Prefecture.

Riken Komatsu, 41, a writer involved in reconstruction activities in Iwaki, tweeted, “If (the government) thinks it can get the general public to understand just by creating a cute character, it is making a mockery of risk communication.”

Komatsu told Kyodo News that local fishermen are doing all they can to fight against the release of the water containing tritium into the sea, with many Fukushima residents trying their best to suppress their anger.

“The gap between the gravity of the problems we face and the levity of the character is huge,” he said.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan blocked access to all social media on Friday, after days of anti-French protests across the country by radical Islamists opposed to cartoons they consider blasphemous.

Sites temporarily blocked on orders from the country's interior ministry included Twitter and Facebook, said Khurram Mehran, a spokesman for Pakistan's media regulatory agency. He gave no further details.

The move comes as police officials prepare to clear a large demonstration in the eastern city of Lahore, and just hours after the government said the leader of the outlawed Islamist political party at the forefront of the protests had urged his supporters to stand down.

By releasing a note they say was handwritten by Saad Rizvi, the government hopes to calm tensions after his Tehreek-e-Labiak Pakistan party stirred up the violent protests, in which two police officers were killed and 580 injured. France urged its citizens to leave the country as a result.

Three demonstrators also died in the clashes with security agencies, and the government has imposed a ban on the party.

A photo of the statement was released earlier by an advisor to the prime minister on Twitter, but neither Rizvi himself or any of his party leadership was immediately available for comment. Some of his followers insisted they hear or see the words come from Rizvi himself before stopping, and the Lahore protest continued after Friday prayers.

On Thursday, the French embassy in Pakistan advised all of its nationals and companies to temporarily leave the Islamic country, after violence erupted over Rizvi's arrest.

Violent protests have been going on in Lahore since Monday, damaging private and public property and disrupting the much-need supply of oxygen to hospitals. Some of the affected included COVID-19 patients, who were on oxygen support.

In the statement, Rizvi asked his supporters to peacefully disperse for the good of the country and end their main sit-in that began Monday, when police arrested the radical cleric for threatening protests if the government did not expel the French ambassador before April 20.

Rizvi's arrest sparked violent protests by his followers, who disrupted traffic by staging sit-ins across the country. Although security forces cleared almost all of the rallies, thousands of Rizvi's followers are still assembled in Lahore, vowing to die in order to protect the honor of Islam's Prophet Muhammad.

Rizvi became the leader of the outlawed Tehreek-e-Labiak Pakistan party in November after the sudden death of his father, Khadim Hussein Rizvi. His party also wants the government to boycott French products.

Rizvi's outlawed party has denounced French President Emmanuel Macron since October last year, saying he tried to defend blasphemous caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad as freedom of expression. Macron had spoken after a young Muslim beheaded a French school teacher who had shown caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad in class.

The images had been republished by the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo to mark the opening of the trial over the deadly 2015 attack against the publication for the original caricatures.

That enraged many Muslims in Pakistan and elsewhere who believe those depictions were blasphemous. Rizvi's group in recent years became known for opposing any change to the country's harsh blasphemy laws, under which anyone accused of insulting Islam or other religious figures can be sentenced to death if found guilty.

0,"Russia, UK bolster Black Sea presence amid latest Ukraine row",https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-bolsters-black-sea-presence-after-latest-ukraine-row/,"Russia and Britain are both sending warships to the Black Sea as tensions between Moscow and Ukraine simmer following dueling diplomat expulsions over the weekend.

Moscow deployed two warships through the Bosphorus on Saturday and is sending additional smaller ships from its Caspian and Baltic fleets all aimed at bolstering its presence in the Black Sea, according to Reuters and Russian media reports.

The movements come on top of Russia’s massive troop build-up along its border with Ukraine in recent weeks, prompting fears of a possible invasion. Russia annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea in 2014, and skirmishes have continued at a low level along the border ever since.

Western allies have rallied behind Ukraine over Moscow’s military aggression, but have stopped short of committing to additional military aid or sanctions.

For its part, the U.K. is planning to deploy vessels to the region next month in an effort to underscore support for Kyiv, according to The Sunday Times. And last week, NATO’s Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken stood firmly with Ukraine, without indicating what steps they might take to counteract Russia’s behavior.

U.S. President Joe Biden did drop plans to send two warships into the Black Sea following protests from Russia.

In the latest flare-up between Moscow and Kyiv over the weekend, Russia’s security services on Saturday accused a Ukrainian diplomat of trying to access classified local law enforcement databases in Saint Petersburg, prompting authorities to expel the envoy.

Ukraine promptly dismissed the claims.

“We absolutely reject the accusations made against the consular officer,” a spokesman for Ukraine’s foreign ministry said in an emailed statement, adding the move shows Russia is choosing a “line of hostility.”

In response, a senior diplomat from Russia’s embassy in Kyiv has been given 72 hours from Monday to leave the country, the spokesman said.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been trying to marshal international backing as he navigates the potential crisis. In Paris on Friday, Zelenskiy called for fresh four-way talks between Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany in the so-called Normandy format to discuss the situation. Diplomatic advisers from the four countries are set to meet on Monday.

0,Eritrea confirms its troops are fighting in Ethiopia’s Tigray,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/17/eritrea-confirms-its-troops-are-fighting-ethiopias-tigray,"For months, both sides denied Eritreans were involved, contradicting testimony from residents, rights groups, aid workers, and diplomats.

Eritrea has acknowledged for the first time its forces are taking part in the months-long war in Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region and promised to pull them out in the face of mounting international pressure.

The explicit admission of Eritrea’s role in the fighting came in a letter posted online late on Friday by the country’s information minister, written by its ambassador to the United Nations and addressed to the Security Council.

Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed sent troops into Tigray in November last year to disarm and detain leaders of the region’s once-dominant political party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF).

For months, the Ethiopian and Eritrean governments denied Eritreans were involved, contradicting testimony from residents, rights groups, aid workers, diplomats and even some Ethiopian civilian and military officials. Tigray residents have repeatedly accused Eritrean forces of mass rape and massacres, including in the towns of Axum and Dengolat.

Abiy finally acknowledged the Eritreans’ presence in March while speaking to MPs, and promised soon after that they would leave.

Friday’s letter from Eritrea said, with the TPLF “largely thwarted”, Asmara and Addis Ababa “have agreed – at the highest levels – to embark on the withdrawal of the Eritrean forces and the simultaneous redeployment of Ethiopian contingents along the international boundary”.

It came a day after UN aid chief Mark Lowcock told the Security Council that despite Abiy’s earlier promise, there had been no evidence of a withdrawal of Eritrean troops from the region.

He also said aid workers “continue to report new atrocities which they say are being committed by Eritrean Defence Forces”.

‘Increasing international presure’

William Davison, the International Crisis Group’s (ICG) senior analyst for Ethiopia, told Al Jazeera that Eritrea’s admission came as in recent weeks increasing proof made it harder to continue denying the presence of its forces in Tigray.

“Obviously, with that mounting evidence [came] increasing international pressure,” he said.

“Ethiopia’s government admitted the Eritrean presence and said they would withdraw and Eritrea said nothing; that did lead to suspicions that there was a difference between the two governments who are allies in this conflict in Tigray, so perhaps Eritrea’s government also wanted to dispel the idea that there was any major split between Addis Ababa and Asmara.”

Looking ahead, Davison said it was a matter of the international community to monitor “very carefully” whether the Eritrean troops will indeed leave Tigray.

“[That is] because, of course, up until now, the two governments have completely denied Eritrea’s presence. So therefore, there’s no particular reason to take them at their word that this withdrawal commitment will be implemented.”

Eritrea and Ethiopia blame the conflict on TPLF-orchestrated attacks on federal army camps in early November and describe it as a campaign to restore law and order. he TPLF says Abiy’s government and its longtime foe Eritrea launched a “coordinated attack” against it.

The conflict arrived in the middle of the harvest in Tigray and for months humanitarian access was greatly restricted, prompting fears of widespread starvation.

In his comments on Thursday, the UN’s Lowcock said he had received a report of 150 people dying of hunger in one area of southern Tigray, calling it “a sign of what lies ahead if more action is not taken”.

The foreign ministry also offered what it called a suggestion that the American ambassador temporarily return to Washington and it banned entry into Russia by eight current and former United States officials, Sergey V. Lavrov, the foreign minister, said.

The response, mostly mirroring the diplomatic rebuke by the United States from the day before, suggested the Russian government did not intend an escalation that could worsen already dismal relations between the countries. Those relations have frayed in good part over Russian cyberattacks and interference in American elections.

President Biden had indicated that the new American sanctions would signal a harder line toward Moscow, though he left a door open for dialogue, after years of deferential treatment under the Trump administration.

Dr. Anthony Fauci on Sunday predicted that U.S. health regulators will end the temporary pause on distributing Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine, adding he expects a decision could come as soon as Friday.

""My estimate is that we will continue to use it in some form. I doubt very seriously if they just cancel it. I don't think that's going to happen. I do think that there will likely be some sort of warning or restriction or risk assessment,"" Fauci said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

U.S. health regulators recommended last week that use of the J&J vaccine be paused after reports of six cases of rare brain blood clots in women, out of some 7 million people who have received the shot in the United States.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advisory panel is set to meet on April 23 to discuss the next steps for the vaccine.

Fauci said he does not know what the final decision will be, but he predicts there will be a resumption.

""I don't know if there have been further cases. We will know that by Friday, and I would be very surprised ... if we don't have a resumption in some form by Friday. A decision almost certainly will be made by Friday,"" Fauci said on CBS' ""Face the Nation.""

""I would be surprised if we didn't have the high school kids being able to be vaccinated by the fall term,"" he told CBS. ""I think by the time we get to the first quarter of 2022, we will be able to vaccinate children of virtually any age - hopefully before then,"" he added.

Text messages were sent to 20 million Americans directing them to more than a dozen fake U.S. government websites, police in the Southeast Asian nation said late Thursday.

Thousands of victims supplied personal information, including social security numbers, to the fake sites in the hopes of securing $2,000 offered under an assistance program for the unemployed, authorities said.

But their data was instead used by scammers to steal millions of dollars from the program.

""Some 30,000 U.S. citizens were scammed and the government's financial loss is up to $60 million,"" said East Java police chief Nico Afinta.

The two suspects were arrested last month in Indonesia's second-biggest city Surabaya after police were notified by U.S. authorities.

A majority of Americans want to end lifetime appointments for U.S. Supreme Court justices, according to an Ipsos poll for Reuters, though less than half are in favor of other efforts to reform the judiciary.

The national opinion poll, conducted on Thursday and Friday, found that 63% of adults supported term or age limits for Supreme Court justices. Another 22% said they opposed any limits and the rest did not express an opinion.

The poll also found that only 38% would support expanding the size of the court by adding four more justices. Another 42% said they would oppose doing so and the rest were unsure.

Liberal activists and some legal scholars have been pushing for judicial reforms as Republican leaders in Congress built a 6-to-3 conservative Supreme Court majority over the past several years, in part by blocking a Democratic nominee and allowing Republican former President Donald Trump to install three picks during his single term.

Some Democratic lawmakers on Thursday introduced legislation to expand the Supreme Court to 13 justices, a move that they believe would restore public confidence in the judicial branch. But the party's leadership appeared cool to the idea of pursuing that course.

President Joe Biden has formed a bi-partisan committee to look at the merits of adding justices as well as other potential reforms to the court.

While Congress has the power to change the number of justices who sit on the court, legal scholars believe it would likely require a constitutional amendment to end their lifetime appointments.

The poll found that only 49% of Americans have a ""great deal"" or a ""fair amount"" of confidence in decisions made by Supreme Court justices. In comparison, 43% of respondents expressed a similar amount of trust in decisions made by the White House and 32% said the same of decisions made by Congress.

The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. The survey gathered responses from 1,003 adults. The results have a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 4 percentage points.

0,Olympics on the line as Japan slides back into COVID emergency,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/16/olympics-on-the-line-as-japan-slides-back-into-covid-emergency,"Tougher measures introduced to try and slow spread of COVID-19 that is being driven by new variants.

Tokyo, Japan – With less than 100 days to go before the scheduled opening of the postponed Tokyo Olympics, Japan is witnessing the emergence of a fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic which some fear will dwarf the previous three.

Much to the government’s chagrin, daily coronavirus cases have been on the rise since early March and this week began to cross 4,000 infections a day.

In the 15 months since Japan recorded its first case of COVID-19, there have now been more than 500,000 confirmed infections and nearly 10,000 deaths in the country.

The government of Yoshihide Suga, however, appears determined to host the Tokyo Olympics after the initial one-year delay, and has attempted to downplay the seriousness of the current crisis. It has refused to declare a third “state of emergency.”

But with case numbers swelling and the increasing inability of some regions’ hospitals to cope, some health experts are now speaking up.

Part of the pressure is coming from the nation’s medical leaders, who are voicing concerns despite the administration’s reassurances.

New restrictions and penalities, including early closures for bars and restaurants, have been imposed in an attempt to slow the latest wave of COVID-19 infections [Shane Gibbons/Al Jazeera] Japan Medical Association President Dr Toshio Nakagawa declared on Wednesday that “an early emergency declaration is necessary” in order to stem the spread of the coronavirus.

Dr Haruo Ozaki, the chairman of the Tokyo Medical Association told a local newspaper separately that “if infections spread further, in reality it would be difficult to hold the Olympics in its regular form with athletes coming from various countries, even if the Games are held with no spectators.”

The government’s own top medical adviser, Dr Shigeru Omi, testified to a parliamentary committee this week that “there is no doubt that Japan is entering the fourth wave of infections.”

As of midweek, however, Prime Minister Suga was still trying dismiss such talk, telling the House of Councillors that “new infections have yet to become large waves nationwide.”

But the very next day, his position was undermined by the ruling party’s number-two official, Toshihiro Nikai, who told a television programme that the Olympics might yet need to be called off. “What’s the point of the Olympics if they become responsible for spreading infections?” he asked.

Restrictions imposed

Meanwhile, even as the national government continues to resist calls from the medical community to declare a formal state of emergency, it is gradually expanding the scope of what it now calls “quasi-emergency measures.”

These measures, such as clamping down on nightlife by requiring bars and restaurants to close earlier in the evening, are essentially identical to the state of emergency measures that had been imposed in some regions previously.

The only difference is that they are now backed by the power to impose fines on those who fail to cooperate.

Experts fear the wave of cases that began in Osaka will soon make their way to Tokyo, driven by more infectious variants and the slow pace of the vaccination programme [Michael Penn/Al Al Jazeera] As of Friday, such “quasi-emergency measures” had been authorised in 10 of the nation’s 47 prefectures, including in all of the largest urban centres.

But the restrictions may not be enough to slow the outbreak and experts are pointing to two key reasons why Japan’s fourth wave of COVID-19 could easily become larger than the previous three ones.

The main epicentre of past coronavirus waves was in Osaka Prefecture. But this iteration now threatens Tokyo, Japan’s most populous area. This western prefecture is currently recording more than 1,000 cases on a daily basis – a number that it had never previously hit. The surge has already forced the cancellation of the torch relay there.

It is thought to be only a matter of time before the record-smashing case numbers in Osaka reach Tokyo and other parts of the nation.

Driving these concerns is the second distinctive point about the current wave – most of the new cases in Osaka appear to come from the more infectious COVID-19 variants, rather than the initial version of the virus that fuelled previous waves.

At a Tokyo Medical Association news conference on Wednesday Deputy Chairman Masataka Inokuchi said: “There’s a significant chance that Osaka is the Tokyo of two to three weeks from now.”

Association Chairman Ozaki expressed particular concern about the so-called N501Y mutation, which has already taken hold in the Japanese capital region.

“N501Y is very infectious,” Ozaki warned, “and it’s being said that young people, who were previously not easily infected, are now contracting the virus. It’s important that people of all generations consider getting back to the basics on infection prevention.”

Sluggish vaccination programme

Residents are bracing for tougher public policy measures.

Stephen Zurcher, the dean of Asian Studies at Kansai Gaidai University in Osaka, told Al Jazeera that although his university has only just resumed a policy of allowing students back into the classroom as part of a “hybrid” teaching model, they also know that conditions in the region may soon force them back to a purely online format.

“If [Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura] does decide to go to a full state of emergency and tell people and students to stay home, then of course the school would shut down. We’d have no choice. We’d immediately flip out of this hybrid strategy and move directly to all instruction occurring online,” he said.

An elderly woman receives her coronavirus vaccine shot at a nursing home in Mie Prefecture in central Japan this week. The country has been slow to rollout inoculations compared with other developed countries [Kyodo/via Reuters] Japan can expect little near-term relief from COVID-19 vaccines either.

Although the nation has acquired millions of doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot and will be offering it without charge to all residents, its vaccination programme has been disappointing.

The national government had earlier insisted that the vaccines needed to be tested on ethnic Japanese before granting legal approval. And coordination between ministries and local governments has continued to be sluggish.

The net result is that despite the urgency of preparing for the Olympics, having a national healthcare system and the appointment of a capable minister to oversee the programme – Japan is far behind other advanced nations in getting the vaccine to its people.

So far, less than 1 percent of Japan’s population has received a vaccination, compared with more than 47 percent of the population in the United Kingdom and 37 percent in the United States.

As a result it will be too slow to decisively affect the country’s plans to host the Olympics or hamper the trajectory of the threatening fourth wave.",1128,7011,11,62
0,Hezbollah prepares parallel state in Lebanon using food weapon,https://jpost.com/middle-east/hezbollah-prepares-parallel-state-in-lebanon-using-food-weapon-665431,"‘To be able to shop in these supermarkets, you have to have a card issued by Hezbollah,” said a Hezbollah official, who asked not to be named in a recent France24 report on Lebanon. A few paragraphs later the official clarified his point, “anyone in need can shop with us, regardless of their religious affiliation and even if they are not Hezbollah supporters,” an official told France 24.

What that means is that Lebanese who shop at Hezbollah, an armed terrorist group that also has a political wing and seeks to control Lebanon and use it as a base of operations in the region, is now creating new facts on the ground for its parallel economy. As Lebanon’s economy has faltered, Hezbollah has sought to thrive, strangling Lebanon and increasingly digesting the country. Out of that digestion comes a new chain of supermarkets controlled by the extra-paramilitary armed group. It sells “Syrian, Iraqi and Iranian products at reduced prices that are accessible with a party-issued card,” the report says.What that means is that Lebanese who shop at Hezbollah’s markets can buy from other Iranian-occupied countries. In short, Hezbollah now owns a country called Lebanon and is outsourcing Iranian products to it so Hezbollah and Iran can profit. The more Lebanon falls apart, the greater Hezbollah becomes.

This situation was largely created, or at least tolerated, by the international community that rubber-stamped the idea that Lebanon would have a parallel armed state unlike any other country in the world. No other country has members of parliament from an illegal armed militia that does not answer to the state. Only Lebanon, recipient of US aid and western largesse, has such a situation. Hezbollah was once a smaller sectarian movement that thrived off claiming it was “resisting” Israel. When Israel left it occupied southern Lebanon and didn’t hand over its weapons, even though other armed militias had been demobilized by the Taif agreement in 1989. After the 2006 war that Hezbollah brought on Lebanon by attacking Israel it grew in importance, using its power over reconstruction funds to build up apartments.

Hezbollah has created parallel construction and development entities such Jihad Al-Binaa and the Waad project, its own communications network, TV stations and radio communications networks. It has taken over healthcare, education, welfare and finance in parts of the country. Further information on this can be found at the 2010 report at the Congressional Research Service on Hezbollah’s background by Casey Addis and Christopher Blanchard.

Hezbollah even undertook projects like providing drinking water for parts of Lebanon, claiming this was part of its “resistance” against Israel. In short it got the government to outsource part of government responsibilities to Hezbollah and then it had an iron grip on the country. It even put its own fiber optic communications network to use to bypass the government. Any attempt to stop the takeover is met with Hezbollah violence. Hezbollah attacked adversaires and took over part of the country in 2008 when opposition in the government sought to crack down on the military communication network in the country. Hezbollah coordinated the killing of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri in 2005 using that network.

Now Hezbollah wants the fruits and vegetables too. France24 says this is a “welcome initiative in a country crippled by a financial crisis and food shortages. But critics say it’s yet another bid by the powerful Shiite movement to win loyalty by providing services in a weak state and oversee a parallel economy.”

cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });

if(window.location.pathname.indexOf(""656089"") != -1){console.log(""hedva connatix"");document.getElementsByClassName(""divConnatix"")[0].style.display =""none"";}

Hezbollah exploited the country’s economic failures and food shortage by opening the new supermarkets. “Food in Lebanon is not just overpriced but often impossible to find,” France24. Now Al-Sajjad supermarkets provide cheaper goods but you need a special card and you have to prove you don’t earn much money. “Anyone in need can shop with us, regardless of their religious affiliation and even if they are not Hezbollah supporters,” the Hezbollah official told France24.

The report notes that Hezbollah has been accused of smuggling the goods over the border, stocking shelves by preying on Syria and Iraq. Only 8,000 people so far have supposedly joined the new Hezbollah supermarket membership chain, which acts like a Costco, if Costo was run by an American religious armed militia with members in Congress.

How does it work if you want to shop at Hezbollah’s market? According to the report you may apply but then a Hezbollah party member comes to give you the card. People are apparently so afraid they asked France24 to change their names for the article. “The stores look like large depots and are always fully stocked. I was able to buy milk, rice, sugar and vegetable oil at reduced prices,” one person told the reporters.

Other Islamist groups have used food as a weapon. Pro-Turkey groups would stock warehouses near Kilis during the Syrian civil war and bring it across to displaced people. It is unclear if they distributed it only to their supporters. Food was used as a weapon in Somalia in the 1990s and other conflicts.

According to the report the Al-Sajjad card means a person can get rive, sugar, cooking oil and some other basic products. One teacher said “he had been approached by Hezbollah members from his village who offered to give him an Al-Sajjad card.” With the card he can get health care too. Critics have pointed out that this illustrates how the state no longer exists in Lebanon.

But is Hezbollah only maintaining stability in its Shi’ite areas or using food as a weapon now. “The party sees itself as a victim of a plot hatched against it by the United States, to bring it to its knees,” one person told France24. “It’s responding by ensuring that its public doesn’t go hungry by securing its own supply channels through Iran, Syria or Iraq.”

That seems like it is benefiting Iran, much as Iran subverted Iraq’s economy, destroyed part of Iraq and holds it hostage through armed groups. Iran does the same thing to Yemen. It holes out the country, creates a parallel militia state and then makes everyone go through that parallel state for services, eroding the real institutions. Western governments tend to try to prop up state institutions by arguing this will balance Hezbollah in Lebanon, but that has the affect of only empowering Hezbollah and legitimizing it by enabling the weakened state to limp along while Hezbollah increasingly creates a new, more powerful Hezbollah-state, next to the ruins of the old state.",1094,6870,9,62

From reporting under 10,000 new daily cases earlier this year, daily infections crossed 200,000 on Thursday, according to official data, the highest anywhere in the world.

At Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital (LNJP), one of India’s largest COVID-only facilities with more than 1,500 beds, a stream of ambulances ferried patients to the overflowing casualty ward on Thursday.

Some also arrived in buses and three-wheeled autorickshaws.

The youngest patient was a new-born baby.

“We are definitely over-burdened. We are already working at full capacity,” said the hospital’s medical director, Suresh Kumar.

From an initial 54 beds, the hospital now has over 300 for COVID-19 patients in critical condition. Even that is not enough.

Unrelated patients share beds, while bodies of the recently deceased lie outside the ward before being taken to the mortuary.

“Today we have 158 admissions in Lok Nayak alone,” Kumar said. Almost all were severe cases.

After imposing one of the world’s strictest lockdowns for nearly three months last year, India’s government relaxed almost all curbs by the beginning of 2021, although many regions have now introduced localised restrictions.

LNJP’s Kumar said fast-spreading new variants that evade testing were adding to the burden, as was human behaviour as the country reopened.

“People are not following the COVID guidelines,” he said. “They are just careless.”

Outside the hospital’s mortuary, weeping relatives gathered in the hot sun to wait for the bodies of loved ones to be released.

Prashant Mehra, 40, said he had to pay a broker for preferential treatment before he could get his 90-year-old grandfather admitted to the hospital. The hospital did not immediately respond to a request for comment on his remarks.

Mehra said the effort made little difference in the end.

“He died after six or seven hours,” he said. “We already asked for our money back.”",339,2126,12,62

Military officials in Canberra have been planning out 'worst case' scenarios in which Collins-class submarines and Super Hornet fighter jets would be deployed to the Taiwan Strait to assist the United States and other regional strategic allies.

Pressure is mounting on Australia and fellow 'Quad' members - Japan, India and the US - to keep Beijing's forces at bay as tensions continue to soar over the disputed territory.

China has become increasingly aggressive in the region, stamping out pro-democracy groups in Hong Kong and cracking down on Muslims minorities in Xinjiang.

It is now feared the authoritarian state will turn its military might to Taiwan as it looks to re-unify the island under President-for-life Xi Jinping.

China has repeatedly incurred on Taipei's maritime borders and air space and this week it sent a record 25 military aircraft into into the defence 'identification zone'.

Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen (pictured) has remained staunch in the face of Chinese aggression - with many nations now at loggerheads with the communist superpower

'There is a lot of development and scenario planning going on,' a diplomatic source told the Australian Financial Review.

'It is intended to signal you are not going to blink. It is intended to demonstrate you don't lack commitment.'

Taiwan, backed by the US and Japan, has endured a longstanding conflict with Beijing since the Chinese civil war in 1949 and now its residents are more on edge than ever after watching the erosion of freedom and independence in Hong Kong.

But the island nation remains an important ally of western democratic countries for its close proximity to China and because it produces a significant supply of semiconductor microchips at a time when there is a major global shortage.

In the event that China follows through on the rhetoric of its 'Wolf Warrior' diplomats and attempts to annex the island, it's possible the Quad could come to their aid.

A former defence official said Australian maritime assets like Air Warfare Destroyers and Collins-class submarines could be deployed in such an event to 'bottle up' the Chinese navy.

But he admitted there would be great hesitation in doing so as it would put the vital military vessels and their crews at great risk.

He said it's more likely Canberra would send 'maritime surveillance aircraft, air-to-air refuellers, the Wedgetail airborne radar plane and Super Hornet fighter jets, operating from US bases in Guam or the Philippines'.

ADF chief Angus Campbell has said conflict over the island of Taiwan would be 'disastrous' for the people of the region and should be avoided at all cost.

But as China becomes increasingly belligerent on the world stage - carrying out a fatal border conflict with Indian last year and encroaching on Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan, Vietnam and Brunei in the South China Sea - some believe conflict may be inevitable.

Former Defence Minister Christopher Pyne, who served under Malcolm Turnbull, said last week things may well get a whole lot worse as Beijing looks to poke and prod its Asia Pacific neighbours.

'This isn't rhetoric. This is something that you and I may well have to confront in the next five to 10 years.'

Australia's relationship with its biggest trading partner began to drastically deteriorate in April last year when Prime Minister Scott Morrison called for an independent inquiry into the origins of coronavirus, which first appeared in Wuhan at the end of 2019.

The plea for transparency over Covid-19 infuriated the Communist Party who retaliated by imposing arbitrary bans and tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Australian goods including barley, wine, cotton, seafood, beef, copper, and coal.

0,First monkey–human embryos reignite debate over hybrid animals,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01001-2,"A blastocyst of the monkey–human chimaeras.Credit: Weizhi Ji, Kunming University of Science and Technology

Scientists have successfully grown monkey embryos containing human cells for the first time — the latest milestone in a rapidly advancing field that has drawn ethical questions.

In the work, published on 15 April in Cell1, the team injected monkey embryos with human stem cells and watched them develop. They observed human and monkey cells divide and grow together in a dish, with at least 3 embryos surviving to 19 days after fertilization. “The overall message is that every embryo contained human cells that proliferate and differentiate to a different extent,” says Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, a developmental biologist at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California, and one of the researchers who led the work.

Researchers hope that some human–animal hybrids — known as chimaeras — could provide better models in which to test drugs, and be used to grow human organs for transplants. Members of this research team were the first to show in 20192 that they could grow monkey embryos in a dish for up to 20 days after fertilization. In 2017, they reported a series of other hybrids: pig embryos grown with human cells, cow embryos grown with human cells, and rat embryos grown with mouse cells3.

But the latest work has divided developmental biologists. Some question the need for such experiments using closely related primates — these animals are not likely to be used as model animals in the way that mice and rodents are. Nonhuman primates are protected by stricter research ethics rules than are rodents, and they worry such work is likely to stoke public opposition.

“There are much more sensible experiments in this area of chimaeras as a source of organs and tissues,” says Alfonso Martinez Arias, a developmental biologist at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, Spain. Experiments with livestock animals, such as pigs and cows, are “more promising and do not risk challenging ethical boundaries”, he says. “There is a whole field of organoids, which can hopefully do away with animal research.”

Touchy subject

Izpisua Belmonte says that the team does not intend to implant any hybrid embryos into monkeys. Rather, the goal is to better understand how cells of different species communicate with each other in the embryo during its early growth phase.

Attempts at growing human–mouse hybrids are still preliminary and chimaeras need to be more effective and healthier before they can be useful. Scientists suspect that such hybrids might have trouble thriving because the two species are evolutionarily distant, so the cells communicate through different means. But observing cellular cross-talk in monkey–human embryo chimaeras — which involve two more closely related species — could suggest ways to improve the viability of future human–mouse models, Izpisua Belmonte says.

In the study, researchers fertilized eggs extracted from cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) and grew them in culture. Six days after fertilization, the team injected 132 embryos with human extended pluripotent stem cells, which can grow into a range of cell types inside and outside an embryo. The embryos each developed unique combinations of human and monkey cells and deteriorated at varying rates: 11 days after fertilization, 91 were alive; this dropped to 12 embryos at day 17 and 3 embryos at day 19.

“This paper is a dramatic demonstration of the ability of human pluripotent stem cells to be incorporated into the embryos of cynomolgus monkey when introduced into the monkey blastocysts,” says Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz, a developmental biologist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. She noted that this team, like others in the past, was not able to control which cells developed into which tissues — a key step to master before such models can be used.

Martinez Arias was not convinced by the results. “I expect better evidence,” especially of the later stages of development, he says. That embryo numbers rapidly plummeted as they approached day 15 of development suggests to him “that the things are very sick”.

Combining human cells with closely related primate embryos prompts questions about the status and identity of the resulting hybrids. “Some people may see that you’re creating morally ambiguous entities there,” says Insoo Hyun, a bioethicist at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. He says this team was thorough in following existing guidelines. “I think they did quite a bit of due care to be mindful of regulations and ethical issues.”

Research restrictions

Meanwhile, international guidelines are catching up to the field’s advances — next month, the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) is expected to publish revised guidelines for stem-cell research. These will address nonhuman-primate and human chimaeras, says Hyun, who is leading an ISSCR committee discussing chimaeras. That group’s guidelines currently prohibit researchers from letting human–animal chimaeras mate. Also, the group recommends additional oversight when human cells could integrate with an animal host’s developing central nervous system.

Many countries — including the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan — have at points limited research on chimaeras involving human cells. Japan lifted its ban on experiments with animal embryos containing human cells in 2019 and began funding such work that year.

In 2015, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced a moratorium on federal funding for studies in which human cells would be injected into animal embryos. In 2016, the funding agency proposed lifting the ban but restricting research to hybrids created after gastrulation, when the early nervous system begins to form. More than four years later, the funding ban is still in place. An NIH spokesperson says the agency is awaiting the May ISSCR update “to ensure our position reflects the input from the community”, but did not provide a timeline for release of the agency’s rules.",959,6095,8,62
0,Rwandan Priest Arrested in France for Alleged Role in Genocide,https://www.voanews.com/africa/rwandan-priest-arrested-france-alleged-role-genocide,"PARIS - A Rwandan priest was arrested in France this week on charges of providing, among other things, food to militiamen who massacred members of the Tutsi minority in his church during the 1994 genocide in the African country, authorities said Friday.

Marcel Hitayezu, who was born in 1956, was charged on Wednesday with genocide and being an accomplice to crimes against humanity, according to the national anti-terrorism prosecutor's office.

He was arrested the same day at his home in Montlieu-la-Garde, southwestern France, a source close to the case said.

Prosecutors said Hitayezu was the priest at a church in Mubuga, in southern Rwanda, when the genocide took place and in April 1994 withheld food and water to Tutsis who had sought refuge in his church. He instead gave food to extremist Interahamwe militiamen who attacked the refugees, prosecutors added.

""Marcel Hitayezu denied the charges at his initial appearance before a judge,"" the prosecutor's office said.

Extradition request

Rwanda had sought to extradite Hitayezu, but France's Cour de Cassation, the country's highest criminal court, in 2016 rejected the request, as it did similar requests by Kigali for others suspected of having taken part in the genocide that saw around 800,000 people slaughtered, mainly from the ethnic Tutsi minority.

The genocide between April and July 1994 began after Rwanda's Hutu President Juvenal Habyarimana, with whom Paris had cultivated close ties, was killed when his plane was shot down over Kigali on April 6.

Extremist Hutu militias went on rampage, killing Tutsis and moderate Hutus, in a bloodbath that came after decades of tensions and violence between the two communities.

French authorities had launched a probe into Rwanda's accusations against Hitayezu in July 2019, three years after the extradition request.

""He was until Wednesday vicar to the priest at the Montlieu-la-Garde church,"" the regional archdiocese told AFP.

'Excellent news'

According to the daily La Croix, Hitayezu spent three years in refugee camps in eastern Congo before arriving in France in 1998 or 1999. He was given refugee status in France in 2011.

""It's excellent news,"" Alain Gauthier, who has spent years hunting down people living in France suspected of having taken part in the genocide, told AFP on learning of the arrest.

Gauthier in 2001 also co-founded an association, the Collective of Civil Plaintiffs for Rwanda.

""The church must examine how it gave responsibilities to people suspected of having taken part in the genocide,"" Gauthier added.

0,Ukraine still outgunned as Russia prepares for larger conflict,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/14/ukraine-still-outgunned-as-russia-prepares-for-larger-conflict,"Russia’s unexplained buildup along Ukraine’s border set alarm bells ringing in the west last month as military analysts noted unusual flourishes – such as new field hospitals, long-distance shipments of armour and artillery and last-minute railcar bookings – that did not feel like a normal exercise.

Whether it is merely an attention-grabbing feint or a prelude to an escalation will depend on the Kremlin’s will. But through the buildup, Russia has already signalled that if a larger war does take place, it is prepared to deliver a hammer blow to its neighbour.

“My take is that all the signalling from Russia’s side is that the next war with Ukraine will be a much larger one … and that it will result in a much larger defeat in terms of Ukrainian force. That’s at least what they’re posturing,” said Michael Kofman, a senior researcher at CNA, referring to the troop buildup and rhetoric from Kremlin officials. At least so far, he said, Russia was making its buildup “very easy to see and find”.

The message has reached US and Nato officials, who have reaffirmed their support for Kyiv and called on Russia to de-escalate tensions. Joe Biden has proposed holding a presidential summit with Vladimir Putin. The foreign ministers of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia are expected to visit the conflict zone on Thursday.

Ever since the outbreak of war in 2014, the militaries of Ukraine and Russia have been preparing their troops for a larger conflict. Over those years, Russia’s ground forces have modernised considerably, seeing combat in Ukraine and Syria and deploying permanently along the border.

Ukraine, too, has retooled its military, which has fought a grinding war in the country’s east for seven years, boosting defence spending and seeking to recruit international support to ward off an aggressive neighbour with far greater resources.

“I would say that we have done the absolute best, or at least very well, that we could based on the funding and constraints we had,” said Mykola Bielieskov, a Kyiv-based military analyst, noting significant “quantitative improvements” in terms of building up numbers of troops, artillery, air defence systems and operational aircraft.

That buildup has had its limits in terms of acquiring unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and secure communications equipment and modernising battle tanks, he said, but there has been much better maintenance of existing stock than up to 2014. “What has changed is we now maintain the Soviet heritage much better than we had,” he said.

At the outbreak of the 2014 war, Ukraine’s military was barely in a position to fight a war. The vast majority of its troops seemed unable to carry out orders, and much of its equipment, including armour and aircraft, was not battle-ready. In the early stages of the conflict, volunteer battalions filled out the ranks on the frontlines. “The army was in tatters – in freefall, I would say. A couple more years of this and the army would have been nonexistent,” said Bielieskov.

Since then, defence spending in Ukraine has increased from $1.9bn to more than $4.7bn, allowing Ukraine to build up to 38 line and artillery brigades. Much of the investment has gone into artillery, he noted, after battles in 2014-15 showed that the Ukrainian military was outgunned by Russia’s UAV-guided long-range fire, which caused up to 80% of the casualties among Ukrainian fighters. Combat experience and training have also improved across the armed forces and the officer corps. A former diplomat in Kyiv called it a “major overhaul”.

Still, Russia maintains a larger and more advanced military force (its military spending is 10 times greater in dollar terms), and in the case of an all-out invasion it would probably use different tactics, launching attacks using air power, special forces and paratroopers, and electronic warfare, cutting a potential defence down to a period of weeks, Bielieskov estimated. In a worst-case scenario, Ukrainian military planners still may hope to raise the cost of an invasion, including the potential for urban and guerrilla warfare, to make it far less palatable for Moscow.

“It’s likely about making Russia pay the highest price using our regular forces and then starting this kind of campaign of resistance,” said Bielieskov.

Ukraine has turned its army into an effective force in Donbas, where it has had to invest considerable resources and would be best suited to hold the line against a larger Russian force.

But analysts say it would be put at a disadvantage if it had to turn to face an invading force on two fronts, potentially coming from Crimea and from the north, where Russia has established a base just 150 miles from the border, with tanks, rocket artillery and even short-range ballistic missiles.

“The Russian military is in a very different place than it was in 2014-15,” said Kofman, noting a “tremendous level of modernisation”, training, combat experience, upgraded kit and the new deployment of tactical formations along the Ukrainian border, as well as expanded logistical capacity. “They’re not going to repeat the contest that they had.”

Moscow would probably seek a “short and sharp” conflict, Kofman said, avoiding a grinding war for territory and minimising the importance of Ukraine’s large operational reserves.

“Realistically, they’re still tremendously both outgunned and outnumbered,” he said.",872,5383,9,62

Speaking to reporters during a visit to Greece, Kluge did point to “early signs that transmission may be slowing across several countries'' and cited ""declining incidence""' among the oldest people.

0,Ukraine may seek nuclear weapons if left out of NATO: Diplomat,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/16/ukraine-may-seek-nuclear-weapons-if-left-out-of-nato-diplomat,"A Ukrainian diplomat has reportedly warned Kyiv may be forced to acquire nuclear weapons to safeguard the country’s security if NATO does not accede to its membership demand amid spiralling tensions with neighbouring Russia.

Andriy Melnyk, Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany, suggested to national public radio network Deutschlandfunk on Thursday that President Volodymyr Zelensky’s administration was weighing up all possible options as fears mount over a possible escalation of hostilities in the country’s conflict-stricken east.

“Either we are part of an alliance like NATO and also make our contribution to strengthen this Europe, or we have only one option; to rearm ourselves,” Germany’s DPA news agency quoted Melnyk as saying. “How else could we guarantee our defence?”

His comments came after intensified fighting in recent weeks in Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions, where government forces have battled Russian-backed separatists since the rebels seized a swath of territory there in April 2014.

Meanwhile, Russia has amassed tens of thousands of troops as well as tanks and artillery near the shared border in the region. Moscow has also mobilised troops in the annexed Black Sea region of Crimea, which it annexed from Ukraine in March 2014.

Kyiv’s NATO push

Ukraine is currently an ally of NATO, but not a member. It has sought to launch accession talks for years but has consistently been turned down.

The issue has acquired renewed urgency of late as a result of the stand-off with Moscow.

Earlier this month, Kyiv called for its entry into the alliance to be fast-tracked, saying it was the only way to end the conflict in the Donbas region, of which Donetsk and Luhansk are a part.

Moscow opposes Kyiv’s ascension bid and has accused NATO and leading member the United States of turning Ukraine into a “powder keg” with increasing arms supplies to the country.

NATO, meanwhile, has told Ukraine to roll out domestic reforms and develop its defence capabilities in order to be considered for membership.

While a ceasefire halted full-scale warfare in Donbas in 2015, sporadic clashes never ceased [File: Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters] Zelensky said on Friday that he had again raised the issue of Ukraine’s NATO membership bid while attending talks with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris. German Chancellor Angela Merkel also joined the discussions in the French capital via video link.

The Ukrainian president told reporters following the meeting that he felt supported by France and Germany, both of which are NATO members, with regards to his country’s action plan for joining the alliance.

He also said he was ready to hold four-way talks that included Russian President Vladimir Putin to calm relations with its neighbour, adding that he thought a separate meeting between US President Joe Biden and Putin proposed by Washington could help solve some issues.

Putin urged to pull back

Kyiv earlier this week pinned the blame for the escalating tensions with Russia squarely on Moscow, with Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba condemning the Kremlin’s “aggravation of the security situation” in the region.

Addressing a news conference on Thursday, Kuleba accused Russian pundits and officials of “openly threatening Ukraine with war and the destruction of Ukrainian statehood”.

He also warned Moscow against initiating any incursion into Ukraine, stating any intensification of the escalation in the Donbas region would have “very painful” consequences for Russia.

“The red line of Ukraine is the state border. If Russia crosses the red line, then it will have to suffer,” he said. “The world is on the side of Ukraine and international law.”

Putin has overseen the massing of tens of thousands of troops as well as tanks and artillery near Russia’s shared eastern border with Ukraine [File: Mikhail Metzel/Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP] The Kremlin has repeatedly denied interfering in Donbas, but Ukraine and several Western countries have said separatist forces in the region have been armed, led, funded and aided by Russia.

Moscow has also said its troop movements in the region pose no threat and are merely defensive. It has also stated the military units would remain in position as long as the Kremlin saw fit.

But the buildup has alarmed Ukraine’s allies, prompting calls from NATO and several of the alliance’s member states – including the US, Germany and France – for Putin to order a pullback.

In the latest such appeal, Macron, Merkel and Zelensky on Friday jointly urged Moscow to reverse course.

Berlin (AFP)

A bruising internal struggle to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel has left Germany's once stable ruling conservatives in disarray and on the brink of implosion less than six months ahead of elections in September.

The fight between long-time Merkel-ally Armin Laschet and his more popular Bavarian rival Markus Soeder threatens to further destabilise the once dominant CDU/CSU alliance, whose poll ratings have plummeted in recent months.

Elected head of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union in January, Laschet would usually be the first choice to lead both the CDU and its Bavarian sister party CSU into September's general election.

Yet his claim to be chancellor candidate has been bitterly contested by CSU leader Soeder, who currently commands more support from both the public and conservative lawmakers.

The scrap for Merkel's throne has opened up historic wounds between the two parties and could even loosen their 16-year grip on the chancellery.

With the clock ticking down to September 26 elections, the bitter divisions poisoning the conservatives spell a rocky campaign ahead for a post-Merkel era.

It also leaves them exposed, with the internal squabbles sapping attention at a time when Europe's biggest economy is struggling to end a raging pandemic that has killed 80,000 and ravaged thousands of businesses and livelihoods.

- Historic squabbles -

""The CDU/CSU has not seen a showdown like this for more than 40 years!"" wrote Bild newspaper after Soeder and Laschet exchanged verbal blows in a meeting with conservative MPs.

Yet it is by no means the first time that the CDU and CSU have been at odds over who should take the top job.

In 1980, CSU leader Franz-Josef Strauss was nominated ahead of CDU candidate Ernst Albrecht and his then unpopular party leader Helmut Kohl.

In 2002, meanwhile, the newly appointed CDU chair Angela Merkel stepped back to allow Bavarian rival Edmund Stoiber to run.

In both cases, the CSU candidate was widely seen as a more charismatic and voter-friendly option, before being ultimately beaten in the polls by the incumbent social-democrats.

Both Kohl and Merkel then defied their critics at the next elections, going on to become Germany's longest-serving chancellors.

That could bode well for the currently unpopular Laschet, who has been praised for his ability to ""sit out opponents"".

Yet while Kohl and Merkel emerged with the conservatives in opposition, Laschet has a tougher job of keeping the CDU/CSU in power as they squabble over the vacuum left by Merkel's departure.

The chancellor has held the alliance together throughout her reign, maintaining her authority even when the CSU openly challenged her handling of the refugee crisis in 2015.

""If the party has nobody behind which it can unite, then things become brutal. It was like that after the Kohl era, and it is like that now at the end of the Merkel era,"" wrote weekly Der Spiegel in an editorial last week.

The magazine argued that the CDU/CSU would be better off going into oppositon, and ""finding a new king or queen in peace and quiet"".

- 'United?' -

With the surging Green Party snapping at their heels, the prospect of losing power now looms larger than ever for the conservatives, who have hit new lows in the polls amid a corruption scandal and anger over the pandemic.

Divisions may remain even if they retain power, with lawmakers said to favour Soeder and CDU grandees having already backed Laschet.

If Laschet prevails, he will have work ahead of him to win back support within his own party ranks.

If Soeder gets the nod, it spells questions for the authority of the CDU's leadership which has thrown their backing behind Laschet.

""There are wounds that will remain, or in any case, that won't heal so quickly as to not leave a mark during the election campaign,"" said Spiegel.

On Friday, MPs from both parties were collecting signatures to force a vote on the issue next week if a unanimous decision could not be reached behind closed doors.

""This is already the third power struggle in the CDU/CSU in the last three years. That shows that the party has lost its orientation, its centre,"" wrote Die Zeit newspaper this week.

Yet others insist that the ever-pragmatic conservatives can still bounce back.

""Whatever happens, both parties will go into the election campaign in a united way"" political scientist Nils Diederich of Berlin's Free University told AFP.

""The alliance will not break down just because two people are competing to be chancellor.""

0,Cancer patient saw disease all but vanish after catching Covid,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/14/cancer-patient-saw-disease-vanish-catching-covid/amp/,"Covid may have caused a cancer patient's tumours to vanish, according to doctors, who said it could have sparked an ""anti-tumour immune response"" in the man.

The 61-year-old patient at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro had a check-up last summer after being diagnosed with Hogkin's Lymphoma, a rare blood cancer that affects 2,100 people in the UK each year.

The disease, which occurs when white blood cells get out of control and spread to the lymph nodes, is typically treated with chemotherapy and around 90 per cent of patients are still alive five years afterwards.

Days after being told his chest was riddled with tumours and before starting treatment, the man was admitted to hospital after developing severe Covid. After making a full recovery, he had another scan and discovered the cancer had almost completely disappeared.

Sudden remission with Hogkin's Lymphoma is possible but is extremely rare. Just a couple of dozen similar cases have ever been recorded worldwide.

The case was revealed in the British Journal of Haematology.

Dr Sarah Challoner, of the Royal Cornwall Hospital, said: ""We think Covid-19 triggered an anti-tumour immune response.""

Dr Challoner added that the medical team believed T-cells, which fight infections in the body, may have also attacked cancer cells and led to the remission.

However, other clinicians warned against making early assumptions about the cause of the recovery. Martin Ledwick, Cancer Research UK's head cancer information nurse, said: ""At this stage it's too early to draw any conclusions from these cases – it's quite possibly a coincidence.

""Anyone undergoing cancer treatment should continue to follow the advice of their doctors, as well as protecting themselves from catching Covid-19, and we encourage all who can to take up the vaccine.""

A report in the Italian medical journal Acta Biomedica, published last year, highlighted a similar case at Cremona Hospital in Italy.",309,1948,10,62
0,International team creates first chimeric human-monkey embryos,https://www.statnews.com/2021/04/15/international-team-creates-first-chimeric-human-monkey-embryos/,"A team of scientists from the U.S., China, and Spain reported Thursday they have created the first embryos that were part human and part monkey and kept them alive for up to 20 days in laboratory dishes.

The ethically controversial creation of chimeras — containing cells from multiple species — is part of a drive to make experimental models to help scientists better understand early development, devise new treatments for human disease, and possibly find methods to grow organs for transplant inside other animals, such as pigs or sheep. Such chimeras can be used in experiments that can’t be done with human embryos, for example, but combining human cells with those of primates ushers in new and urgent ethical concerns.

To be clear, the work, published in the journal Cell, is in very early stages. The team did not create living, breathing part-human animals. They created very early embryos and never implanted them into the uterus of any animal. Concerns about human-animal chimeras center on what Stanford bioethicist and legal scholar Hank Greely calls “brains, balls, and beauty” — worries that an animal could look at all human, be born with a human brain, or be able to reproduce.

This experiment carried none of those risks, but makes it clear that the time to start discussing the ethics of human-animal chimeras is now. “It’s a first-in-kind experiment,” Nita Farahany, a professor of law and philosophy at the Duke University School of Law who co-authored a perspective piece on the ethics of the research, told STAT. “Whenever you cross a major technological or biological hurdle like this one, it’s a good moment to stop and reflect.”

The report provides the scientific details of work that began several years ago in Spain and China and made waves after it was leaked to the El País newspaper in 2019. (The Covid-19 pandemic delayed the completion and publication of the work, the researchers said.)

In the experiment, researchers injected 25 of a specific kind of human pluripotent stem cell (called “pinnacle stem cells” because they can turn into any kind of cell, including extraembryonic cells such as placenta) into each of 132 6-day-old macaque monkey embryos. The researchers stained the human cells with an exceptionally bright red fluorescent protein called tdTomato so they would be detectable within the monkey embryo as it developed.

The scientists took advantage of a new technique that allowed them to grow monkey embryos outside the womb for up to 20 days, a stage where the embryos were still largely undeveloped, but had formed layers and cavities. Survival of the embryos declined during the experiment; after 10 days, 103 embryos were still developing, and by day 19, just three of the chimeric embryos remained alive. (After 20 days, monkey embryos grown outside the womb, even those that are not chimeric, simply collapse.)

Still, the researchers found a high number of human cells in the chimeric embryos that survived. On average, 3% to 4% of the cells in the embryos were human, and in one embryo, up to 7% were. “When we observed human cells were alive in monkey embryos, that was amazing,” Tao Tan, a principal investigator at the State Key Laboratory of Primate Biomedical Research and Kunming University of Science and Technology in Yunnan, China, and one of the paper’s lead authors, told STAT.

Work published earlier this year by a research group in France showed that human cells did not survive well in monkey embryos. The key to the success in the new paper may be the particular stem cells that were used, as well as the way they were cultured.

The work, other scientists said, is the most successful to date in keeping a relatively large number of human cells alive and healthy in a nonhuman embryo. “This paper is a dramatic demonstration of the ability of human pluripotent stem cells to be incorporated into the embryos of the cynomolgus monkey,” said Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz, a developmental biologist at Caltech whose lab first developed, in mice, the technique of growing embryos in lab dishes. Such work gained increasing attention with the announcement last month that Jacob Hanna, a developmental biologist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, had kept mouse embryos alive and seemingly healthy for an extended period in an artificial womb.

The results published Thursday showed a far higher rate of survival for human cells in a nonhuman embryo than in previous experiments with sheep-human or pig-human chimeras, where sometimes just one in 100,000 cells were human.

It was those disappointing results that pushed the researchers to turn to monkeys, which are much more closely related to humans and have a similar developmental timeline, said the project’s leader, Salk Institute developmental biologist Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte. “Human cells do not robustly contribute to chimera formation in species evolutionarily distant to humans,” he said.

In monkeys, it was a different story. “We found the human and monkey cells cooperate with each other in building the embryo,” said Jun Wu, a research team member who is now an assistant professor at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, but was a staff scientist at the Salk when he worked on the project. Wu’s research has shown that when human cells are placed in culture with mouse cells, “we see the mouse cell actively kill the human cell, but when we place human and monkey cells together, there is no competition.”

Experiments such as this one cannot be funded with federal research dollars, though they break no U.S. laws. The work was conducted in China, not because it was illegal in the United States, the researchers said, but because the monkey embryos, which are difficult to procure and expensive, were available there. The experiment used a total of 150 embryos, which were obtained without harming the monkeys, “just like in the IVF procedure,” Tan said.

But such experiments, which combine human cells with those of animals, are nevertheless controversial. This work, and other work by Izpisua Belmonte, has moved so rapidly, bioethicists have had trouble keeping up.

“The complicated thing is that we need better models of human disease, but the better those models are, the closer they bring us to the ethical issues we were trying to avoid by not doing experiments in humans,” Farahany said. “Remarkable steps forward require urgent public engagement.”

In addition to considerations about research that may blur the line between humans and animals, the work on monkeys raises issues about both animal welfare and human consent. While many “de-identified” human cells can be used in research without consent for specific experiments, that may not be the best approach for highly controversial experiments such as this one, she said.

Izpisua Belmonte and the other researchers agreed that ethical debate and guidelines for such work is critical. They said they discussed the work with ethicists before proceeding and received extensive review and approval from all scientific institutions involved. The paper’s discussion section starts not with scientific findings as is usual in a research paper, but with a statement about ethical considerations.

The researchers say animal-human chimeras could prove a powerful tool in biomedicine and that the new research is important for helping understand what roadblocks stand in the way of merging human cells into animal embryos. Their hope is to understand the principles in monkey-human chimeras, which seem easier to create, and then try to apply that knowledge to the more technically challenging but ethically more acceptable pig-human chimeras.

The researchers, and other scientists STAT contacted for comment, said one of the most exciting things about the new paper was the discovery of “crosstalk” between human and monkey cells in the developing embryo, something that did not occur so readily in human-pig chimeras. “Human cells in pig tissue is akin to communications between two distant languages, such as Chinese and French, whereas human cells in macaques is like communications between two closely related languages, like Spanish and French,” said Izpisua Belmonte. “We do think understanding interspecific cross-talk could be the key for generating more successful chimeras.”

One major goal, they say, is to find a way to grow human organs in pigs or other animals to ease the shortage for transplants. Currently, more than 100,000 Americans are awaiting organs for transplant. But some scientists question whether that goal is achievable given how hard the research has proven so far.

“How realistic is it to think that someday this line of research could actually be able to produce organs for transplants into human patients?” asked Paul Knoepfler, a stem cell scientist and professor at the UC Davis School of Medicine. “If that is extremely unlikely given technical challenges, even setting aside ethical considerations, how much further should this research be pushed just to advance our knowledge of human development?”

Knoepfler said the research posed a host of other questions as well. “Is there a point at which a chimera is “too human”? For instance, what if a monkey-human chimera ended up being more human than monkey, should special rules apply?” he asked. “What if there are many human cells in the developing brain of a chimera?”

The issue of the brain merits special consideration, in part because many consider the brain the organ that makes humans unique. Because of these considerations, the National Academy of Sciences convened a group to weigh in on the ethics and governance of the emerging field of neural organoids, transplants, and chimeras. The report, released earlier this month, stated that many ethical issues in the field could be addressed by existing mechanisms, but that it was critical to continually reassess concerns as the science developed.

The Cell paper is interesting, said the report committee’s co-chair, Joshua Sanes, a neuroscientist and professor of molecular and cell biology at Harvard, but it is not pertinent to a discussion about neural chimeras because the less-than-3-week-old embryos had not reached the point of having a nervous system. Still, he said the new work reinforced the committee’s urging that ethical conversations “get ahead of the curve.”

“It’s pretty clear the entire field is moving ahead with great rapidity,” Sanes said. “It’s not clear how fast it will go, or in which direction, but we do need to revisit these issues regularly.”

Work is already afoot to loosen internationally recognized ethical limits that prohibit scientists from growing any human embryo outside the body for longer than 14 days. The rule had been in place for decades, and was developed in a time when it was technologically impossible to keep embryos alive outside the body for more than a few days. But that’s changed dramatically in recent years, and with increased interest in powerful gene editing tools such as CRISPR to genetically modify embryos to cure disease, motivation is strong to push biological limits further — and to have clear guidelines about what may be going too far.

Said Knoepfler: “Leaving it up to every researcher and institutional ethics review board to entirely come up with their own rules on human embryo research seems to me like a recipe for big trouble.”",1876,11582,7,62
0,New Brexit checks continued to hamper meat exports in February,https://www.pig-world.co.uk/news/new-brexit-checks-continued-to-hamper-meat-exports-in-february.html,"The introduction of new Brexit checks at the start of the year continued to hamper UK meat exports to the EU in February, new trade figures show.

The Government figures, published on Tuesday, show that overall UK exports to the EU made something of recovery from the slump in January, but volumes remain well below 2020 levels.Total exports from the UK to EU were up 47% on the previous month after a record drop of 42% in January.

After plummeting to just £400m in January, exports of food and live animals recovered to £700m in February, although this remains 29% below the £900m the UK exported to the EU in February 2020.

The data for meat and meat preparations showed an even larger deficit, with exports to the EU down 42% on the previous year:

Feb 2019: £115m

Feb 2020: £113m

Feb 2021: £66m

(Export value to the EU of Meat and Meat Preparations, Office of National Statistics, 13 April 2021)

In January, pork exports to the EU fell by a staggering 84%, amounting to just 2,500 tonnes, a reduction of 13,000 tonnes year on year. As a result, overall pig meat (including offal) shipments fell by nearly a half compared with 2020 to only 15,600 tonnes.

NPA Senior Policy Adviser, Charlie Dewhirst, said: “Obviously it’s encouraging to see exports recover from the dire situation in January but we are still a long way short of previous trade numbers.

“The pandemic will still be affecting export opportunities but there is plenty more work to do to tackle the systemic problems. We need to improve and modernise our trading processes with the EU to help the pig sector recapture the export market and sell our world class produce on the Continent.”

Live exports

Live pig exports are still not possible due to the lack of border infrastructure at the Channel ports. NPA senior policy adviser Rebecca Veale told BBC Farming Today how the inability to trade live animals with the EU is damaging the UK pig sector.

She was interviewed as part of a feature about how the new requirement for Border Control Posts (BCP) to inspect animals exported from and imported to the UK is causing disruption across the livestock sectors.

You can listen to the feature HERE (from 3.30 mins)

Questioned about the impact on pigs, Rebecca said: “Unfortunately, on the routes through seaports we would use, there are currently no Border Control Posts.”

She highlighted how BCPs were an issue for individual companies and not something EU Governments had control over. She said the NPA was ‘working really hard’ with some countries who are interested in putting a BCP in place, but stressed, while progress is being made, none are accepting live animals.

“For the pig industry in the UK, it is really important that we export breeding animals. There are a small number of breeding companies and the ability for them to operate in this country and abroad is of relevance to all producers.”

Mr Dewhirst updated the NPA’s Pig Industry Group on the search for new BCPs at EU ports at its latest meeting.

A possible site has been found inland near Calais, although it still needs approval from the French authorities and Brussels. Other options include the Hook of Holland and Zeebrugge. However, none of the facilities have yet been constructed, so it is likely to be some time before exports can resume.

The need for BCPs to check live pigs coming into the UK from the EU has been delayed until the start of 2022 – various possible sites have been identified.

The United Nations and its aid partners have seen no proof of a declared withdrawal of Eritrean troops from Ethiopia’s Tigray region, according to the world body’s top humanitarian official, who also warned the situation in the embattled region has deteriorated.

The comments by Mark Lowcock during a closed-door UN Security Council meeting on Thursday came more than two weeks after Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said Eritrea had agreed to withdraw the allied forces it had sent into the northern Ethiopian region during the conflict that broke out there in November 2020.

“Unfortunately, I must say that neither the UN nor any of the humanitarian agencies we work with have seen proof of Eritrean withdrawal,” the under-secretary general of humanitarian affairs told the council, according to a text of his speech seen by Al Jazeera.

After months of tension, Abiy sent government forces into Tigray on November 4 to detain and disarm leaders of the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), the then-regional ruling party that for decades dominated Ethiopia’s politics.

The winner of the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize said the move came in response to TPLF-orchestrated attacks on federal army camps. The TPLF said Abiy’s government and its longtime foe Eritrea launched a “coordinated attack” against it.

Abiy declared victory after federal forces entered the regional capital, Mekelle, on November 28 but fighting has continued and analysts warn of a prolonged deadlock in a conflict that is believed to have killed thousands of people and left more than five million people in need of aid.

“The humanitarian situation in Tigray has deteriorated,” said Lowcock, adding that the “vast majority” of the region of some six million people “is completely or partially inaccessible” for humanitarian agencies.

“The conflict is not over and things are not improving,” he continued, calling the “reports of systematic rape, gang rape and sexual violence … especially disturbing and alarmingly widespread”.

Civilians have been experiencing “targeted violence, mass killings and executions, and systematic sexual violence as a weapon of war”.

Thursday’s closed-door meeting was the latest in a number of similar sessions since the start of the conflict more than five months ago, but the Security Council has yet to release a statement.

“The Security Council has listened to these reports, it had closed-door meetings but it has been absolutely silent,” said Al Jazeera’s diplomatic editor James Bays, reporting from the UN headquarters in New York. “Security Council members have not managed to agree to a single statement on the situation.”

Asked by Al Jazeera what should be done to improve the situation in Tigray, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric called for an increase in humanitarian access as well as “real movement” on human rights investigations into the “horrific reports” of atrocities and a “real reconciliation within the different groups in Tigray”.

After months of denials, Abiy last month admitted publicly that Eritrean troops had entered Tigray. UN chief Antonio Guterres once said the prime minister had “guaranteed” Eritrean forces were not there.

This week, Amnesty International said Eritrean troops on Monday had opened fire on civilians in Tigray’s Adwa town, in an “unprovoked” attack that killed at least three people and wounded 19 others.

The rights group’s regional director, Sarah Jackson, described the shooting as “yet another unlawful attack by Eritrean troops on civilians in Tigray”.",575,3698,10,62
0,US cancels warships deployment to Black Sea: Turkish officials,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/15/us-cancels-warships-deployment-to-black-sea-turkish-officials,"Turkey said last week the US will send two warships to the Black Sea, a decision Russia called unfriendly provocation.

The United States has cancelled the deployment of two warships to the Black Sea, Turkish foreign ministry officials said, amid concerns over a Russian military build-up on Ukraine’s borders.

Last week, Turkey said Washington would send two warships to the Black Sea, in a decision Russia called an unfriendly provocation.

Washington and NATO have been alarmed by the build-up near Ukraine and in Crimea, the peninsula that Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.

The US embassy in Ankara had notified Turkey’s foreign ministry of the cancellation, officials said on Wednesday but did not provide a reason.

Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency later reported that no new notices had been conveyed to Ankara for potential deployments at later dates.

US officials said Turkey may have misunderstood the initial notification and that the deployment was never confirmed.

They said the US frequently notifies Turkey of potential access to the Black Sea, adding that a request does not necessarily mean its ships will pass through, but rather ensures that if they choose to, they already have the required approval.

Moscow’s warning

Russia, which has warned Washington to stay far away from Crimea and its Black Sea coast, says the build-up is a three-week snap military drill to test combat readiness in response to what it calls threatening behaviour from NATO.

It said the exercise is due to wrap up within two weeks.

Ahead of the notification about US warships, Russia’s navy on Wednesday began a drill in the Black Sea that rehearsed firing at surface and air targets.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called on Moscow on Tuesday to end its troop build-up.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has called for the “worrying” developments in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region to come to an end.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Joe Biden called on Russia to pull back troops from Ukraine’s borders.

Biden, in a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, proposed a summit of the estranged leaders to tackle disputes and told Moscow to reduce tensions over Ukraine, the White House said.",363,2256,9,62
0,Pakistan blocks social media platforms amid protest crackdown.,https://dw.com/p/3s67P?maca=en-gk-volltext-newsstand-world-en-10745-xml-googlenews,"Pakistan placed a temporary ban on several social media websites on Friday.

Platforms that will be unavailable include Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp, YouTube and Telegram.

The Interior Ministry directed the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to block the platforms until 3 p.m. (11:00 GMT).

""Social media has been blocked for a few hours so that troublemakers can not use it during Friday prayers congregations,"" an official told dpa.

Why exactly has social media been blocked in Pakistan?

The block comes amid fears that activists belonging to the radical Islamist Tehreek-e-Labaik (TLP) group might use the technology to perpetuate violent protests that have shaken the country this week.

At least five people including two police officers have been killed, and nearly 600 injured. Around 200 of those are in critical condition.

The TLP has also been agitating against the arrest of its leader, Saad Rizvi, who initially called for the rallies.

Political parties, Islamist groups and militant organizations in Pakistan rely heavily on social media platforms to connect with their followers.

Experts slam 'unconstitutional' move

The block drew widespread criticism from officials and human rights advocates. ""This ban is against the fundamental rights enshrined in the constitution,"" Dr. Mehdi Hassan, the ex-chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, told DW. ""Instead of putting a ban on social media, the government should arrest all the top leadership of the extreme outfit [TLP] and prosecute them in the court of law.""

Islamabad-based analyst Amir Hussain echoed those sentiments, adding that the ban on social media could have wide-reaching consequences on millions of people and businesses, many of whom have become dependent on social media to earn an income.

""Imagine the ways Uber drivers would be affected. Think of the women who are working at home and marketing their businesses through social media,"" Hussain told DW, adding that thousands of Pakistanis living abroad also use social media to conduct phone calls, and will be cut off from their main lines of communication.

He called on the government to alternatively ""change state policy, put an end to hate materials, and take action against those who use religion for political purposes.""

Some analysts, however, have praised the ban. ""The ban is a wise decision,"" Afzal Ali Shigri, a prominent security expert and former inspector general of police, told DW. Without a social media ban, he said, TLP supporters could use the platforms to upload fake videos to inspire further unrest.

""It is a prudent decision but I hope that this decision will be for a short time,"" Shigri added.

TLP supportes launched protests over the publication of caricatures of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad

What is the dispute with France about?

The TLP has been organizing rallies to denounce the publication of cartoons in France depicting the Prophet Muhammad.

The demonstrations prompted the French Embassy in Pakistan to urge its nationals to leave the country temporarily.

Extra security personnel have been deployed to the French embassy, and additional shipping containers placed as fortifications around its outer wall.

Prime Minister Imran Khan's government has struggled to get TLP protests under control in recent years, but this week announced an outright ban against the group.

The TLP is known for holding days-long, violent road protests over blasphemy issues, causing major disruption within the country.

In the most recent protests, demonstrators blocked roads and streets, demanding that the government fulfill an earlier promise to expel the French ambassador by April 20.

By Umberto Bacchi

April 16 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - London's Science Museum came under fire on Friday for having oil and gas major Royal Dutch Shell as a sponsor of an upcoming exhibition on climate change, a move described by environmental groups as ""out-of-step"".

The British museum is set to reopen after coronavirus lockdowns in May with ""Our Future Planet"", a display focusing on carbon capture - the process by which planet-warming gases are sucked out of the atmosphere and stored below ground.

The exhibition, which comes as Britain prepares to host a major U.N. climate summit in November, lists Shell as one of its main sponsors - drawing the ire of green activists.

""It beggars belief that this iconic British institution has freely chosen to link up with Shell ... at such a crucial time,"" Bill McGuire, professor emeritus of geophysical and climate hazards at University College London, said in a statement.

Environmental group Scientists for Global Responsibility said the move was ""irresponsible"", while Culture Unstained, a group campaigning to end fossil fuel sponsorship of culture, accused the museum of aiding ""greenwashing"" efforts.

Ian Blatchford, chief executive of the Science Museum Group, said the museum was transparent about its relationship with energy companies and retained editorial control in all such partnerships.

""Our Future Planet looks at both the cutting-edge technologies and nature-based solutions being developed to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere,"" he said.

""(The exhibition) makes clear that, alongside reducing carbon emissions, carbon capture and storage can be one contribution in the fight against climate change.""

Shell said in a statement its relationship with the museum was based on shared interests to promote engagement in science, adding that it aimed to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.

""Our priority is to avoid emissions, where that is not currently possible, to reduce emissions and, only then, turn to mitigation of emissions, for example through the use of carbon capture and storage technology,"" a spokeswoman said via email.

Carbon capture technologies are seen as a key component in the fight against global warming, with the UK's Climate Change Committee describing their development as a ""necessity"" for the country to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

Yet, critics say underground storage space for captured emissions is limited and focusing on such technologies risks slowing down the transition to green energy sources.

0,How one restaurant’s experiment may help diners breathe safely,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/interactive/2021/indoor-air-quality-safety-experiment/?tid=a_classic-iphone&amp;no_nav=true,"The Post asked three indoor air experts to examine Sierra Mar’s layout, including the location of vents and air filters, and some of the results Hernandez has gathered. They generally agreed that the devices used, and principally the HEPA filters, are known to work, so the design is likely creating a safer indoor experience.

[How to assess the safety of indoor dining]

Nothing is perfectly safe, as Hernandez himself acknowledges. The aim is reducing risk, and Virginia Tech’s Marr said the system Hernandez and Freed devise will do that “substantially.”

“It relies on proven technologies: a combination of excellent ventilation and filtration,” she said. “Real-time monitoring that is publicly available provides valuable information to the public, giving people confidence that the space is indeed low risk.”

Portland State University’s Corsi added that mixing air together indoors is very important, on top of good air ventilation and filtration. The air purifiers are spaced out in part to help do this.

“When you do increase mixing in a space, that does break up that plume of concentrated aerosols between you and an infector,” Corsi said. “That additional mixing causes dispersion, which makes the receptor inhale a lot lower amounts of the infector’s respirable particles.”

Donald Milton, who studies indoor air at the University of Maryland and pushed health authorities early on to recognize the virus’s airborne transmission, also thought the system designed by Hernandez would make dining safer in general. But he drew a distinction between people eating at the same table — where the smaller cordless device, made by Wynd, pushes the air upward — and those who are further away.

“Maybe that system could protect you from the people you’re eating at the same table with. That’s a very challenging thing,” Milton said, noting a device sitting on a crowded tabletop is more likely to be bumped or shifted into the wrong direction.

“But by having good mixing, good filtration of the air in the restaurant generally, you will reduce exposure to people at other tables.”

Marr did note something that Hernandez has been careful about, but that could undermine others attempting the approach: You have to be very careful about where your air purifiers are located. You do not want them pulling air in such a way that you are actually “spreading aerosols between tables,” Marr cautions.

In other words, do not line up two tables and then a purifier, or the air from the farthest table will travel across the central table to the machine, coursing around those seated at the central table along the way. That is the kind of simple, but consequential, mistake that we will learn to avoid in this new world of still invisible, but now demystified, air.

After collecting his measurements at the restaurant, Hernandez shared the data with The Post. It showed the setup worked, he said.

In the north sector of the restaurant, even as occupancy increased to 18 diners, airborne levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) never rose above 2 micrograms per cubic meter. That is even though outdoor PM2.5 levels that evening were at around 10 micrograms per cubic meter.

Indoor carbon dioxide levels rose across the restaurant as the occupancy level increased, but never eclipsed 600 parts per million. Outdoor levels are generally around 400 parts per million.

That rise is not enough to be dangerous, Hernandez suggests, and is actually in a sense good news when compared with the particle findings, since tiny molecules of carbon dioxide gas fly right through filters.

“The gases go up but the particles don’t. That’s the result of an engineering control,” he said.

Hernandez, who has also implemented indoor air quality monitoring for a number of Colorado schools, argues that even once the current pandemic is over, the kind of design that he has created will remain in demand.

“It applies to the next pandemic, colds, flu, whooping cough, you name it,” he said.

For restaurant owner Mike Freed, he is just hoping that California health regulators, and other restaurants, pay attention.

“I don’t think this is rocket science,” says Freed, “which is why it’s mind-boggling to me that the public health officials aren’t talking to the building scientists.”",698,4273,9,62

China's GDP grew by 18.3 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2021, the fastest in three decades, since the data was released, with key economic indicators all expanding at over 20 percent, setting an encouraging start for the year buoyed by a low base, soaring overseas demand and rebounding consumption at home.The stellar data offers a glimpse into the strength of China's economic recovery, which has been retaking lost ground since the second half of 2020. The country is likely to record the highest growth among major economies and make the greatest contribution to the global economy in the first quarter, on top of the US, analysts noted.Looking ahead, China's economy is forecast to keep a stable growth, but may enter ""unchartered waters"" in the second half of the year as geopolitical tensions keep developing and the marginal effect of global economic recovery has weakened.Some analysts are upbeat about China's GDP which might gain by a double-digit growth in the second quarter. For the whole year, the growth rate could reach 9 percent, analysts said, well above the government-set goal of above 6 percent.

In the first three months, China's GDP grew 18.3 percent to 24.9 trillion yuan（$3.82 trillion), compared with a 6.8-percent contraction in the same period last year when the economy came to a standstill amid the coronavirus lockdown.Retail sales soared 33.9 percent, fixed-asset investment jumped 25.6 percent, and industrial production gained by over 24.5 percent, data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Friday.The slew of indicators came in line with estimates, Liu Xuezhi, a senior macroeconomic analyst at Bank of Communications, told the Global Times on Friday.The consumption rally, at a pace apparently faster than the rebound in factory activity, sets the economy for a strong comeback to pre-virus levels, the analyst reckoned.In March alone, retail sales jumped 34.2 percent year-on-year, with the growth rate quickening 0.4 percentage points from the reading for the first two months, per NBS figures.

Industry observers said the data underscores a broadened recovery momentum, particularly in March, which marks a watershed in consumption from ""divergent recovery"" to ""going full swing.""""Millions of Chinese stayed at their working cities during the Spring Festival holidays, coupled with the resurgence of sporadic coronavirus cases, which curbed consumption to some extent in the first two months. With the rollout of a vaccination plan across the country, there was a turnaround in March,"" Lian Ping, head of the Zhixin Investment Research Institute, told the Global Times.""With three minor vacations in the second quarter and consumer confidence being improved, consumption will continue to gain steam in the April-June period,"" Lian added.""The pace of the economic recovery in the second and following quarters would rely more on the recovery of the service sector,"" global asset management giant Fidelity International said in a note sent to the Global Times on Friday.According to domestic travel data during the Qingming Festival in early April, the number of travelers and hotel bookings posted a substantial increase compared with previous holiday breaks, indicating that ""pent-up consumption demand may cause a retaliatory rebound,"" Fidelity International said, stressing more sustainable economic growth is still reliant on the recovery of incomes.In a convincing sign of revenge spending, train tickets to some of the most popular destinations for the upcoming May Day holiday have been sold out the moment they became available, causing platforms to temporarily crash.Analysts also highlighted the role of flooding overseas orders in shoring up China's industrial production acceleration in the first three months.""The global economy seems to be walking out of the pandemic-induced recession, which will boost foreign demand for Chinese merchandise until at least June. This is in contrast to last year, when the recovery of the supply side outpaced that of demand,"" Tian Yun, vice director of the Beijing Economic Operation Association, told the Global Times.Building on the momentum, China will continue to make the biggest contribution to the global economy, serving as an engine of growth for the world. Its gap with the US - the world's largest economy - is expected to further narrow, according to Tian, who expects China's economic scale to overtake that of the US in a decade and usher in a new world economic landscape.In 2020, China's economic volume represented about 70 percent that of the US.In a research note sent to the Global Times on Friday, ICBC International economists Cheng Shi and Wang Yuzhe wrote that the Chinese economy maintained a robust recovery momentum over the past quarter, with the first quarterly expansion reading averaging 5 percent in 2020-21.The Chinese economy's lead over major developed economies, as measured by year-on-year growth, widened again to about 20 percent in the first quarter, an indication of the country's effective virus containment measures, the economists said, expecting China's intrinsically driven economic rebound to continue as the global recovery nears its peak and China's macroeconomic policy avoids a sharp turn.""China is relatively further ahead than most economies in opening up and vaccinating its population. China began by inoculating key groups, including those engaged in handling imported cold-chain products, customs officers, medical workers, and those involved in public transport, to build a first line of immunity against importing the virus,"" Moody's said in an analysis report sent to the Global Times on Friday.The head start is considered to prop up the broader Asia-Pacific region, factoring in its heavy reliance on Chinese demand, according to the rating agency, putting China's GDP growth at 8.2 percent this year.But analysts noted that while China's industrial production has been back to the right track, the growth of fixed-investment and consumption have yet to bounce back to pre-virus levels despite a dramatic improvement from last year.Lian noted that as global supply ability gradually resumed this year, some China-bound commodity orders may experience a withdrawal, or be diverted to other emerging economies, which may impact manufacturing activity.""The GDP growth rates may come down quarter by quarter in 2021, due to the base variation and replacement effect, but it is highly likely that the annual growth rate will be over 10 percent as demands at home keep booming,"" Tian said.In the fourth quarter of 2020, China's GDP grew 6.5 percent year-on-year. For the whole of 2020, its economy expanded by 2.3 percent, the only major economy to achieve a positive growth last year.There are also concerns over the repercussions of rising producer prices on economic growth and the potential headwinds arising from geopolitical uncertainties.But as Liu said, it's not yet the case that inflation rears its ugly head across the board. The country faces a cost-driven structural increase in prices, mainly due to rising commodity prices, such as crude oil, that is being fed through industrial production. It's not domestic demand-fueled price increases and there are no expectations for a substantial rise in asset prices either, according to Liu.He also argued against the impact of external uncertainty on what he described as a domestic demand-buoyed economic recovery.",1167,7542,11,62

BEIJING, April 16 (Reuters) - China's economy grew at a record pace in the first quarter, official data showed on Friday, expanding 18.3% from a year earlier as the recovery from the coronavirus slump accelerated.

The growth in gross domestic product (GDP) was slower than the 19% forecast by economists in a Reuters poll, and followed 6.5% growth in the fourth quarter last year. It was the strongest growth since at least 1992 when official quarterly records started.

China's economy has largely recovered from last year's COVID-19 induced paralysis, fuelled by global vaccination progress, resilient exports and government stimulus.

The world's second-largest economy is expected to grow 8.6% this year, according to a Reuters poll, following a 2.3% rise last year, which was its weakest in 44 years but still made China the only major economy to avoid contraction.

However, there are doubts China can sustain the rapid pace of expansion as the low comparison base seen in the first half of last year fades.

On a quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP rose 0.6% in January-March, the National Bureau of Statistics said, compared with expectations for a 1.5% rise and a revised 3.2% gain in the previous quarter.

0,IAEA confirms Iran has started enriching uranium to 60% purity,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/middle-east/iaea-confirms-iran-has-started-enriching-uranium-to-60-purity,"VIENNA (REUTERS) - Iran has started the process of enriching uranium to 60 per cent fissile purity at an above-ground nuclear plant at Natanz, the UN nuclear watchdog said on Saturday (April 17), confirming earlier statements by Iranian officials.

The move has complicated talks aimed at reviving Iran’s nuclear deal with major powers as it is a big step towards producing weapons-grade uranium.

Iran had previously only reached 20 per cent purity, and that was already a breach of the deal, which says Iran can only enrich to 3.67 per cent.

Iran made the step up to 60 per cent in response to an explosion that damaged equipment at the larger, underground Fuel Enrichment Plant at Natanz. Teheran has blamed Israel and named a man wanted in connection with the blast.

“The Agency today verified that Iran had begun the production of UF6 enriched up to 60 per cent... at the (above-ground) Natanz Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement.

UF6 is uranium hexafluoride, the form in which uranium is fed into centrifuges for enrichment.

A confidential IAEA report to member states seen by Reuters provided more details.

“According to Iran’s declaration to the Agency, the enrichment level of the UF6 produced at PFEP was 55.3 per cent U-235.

The Agency took a sample of the produced UF6 for destructive analysis to independently verify the enrichment level declared by Iran. The results of this analysis will be reported by the Agency in due course,” the report said.",253,1520,10,62
0,Covid-19: India sees new spike in cases despite vaccine rollout,https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n854,"Anoo Bhuyan New Delhi

India is experiencing a sharp spike in covid-19 cases after months of numbers dropping. The rise comes as India celebrates festivals like Holi, religious functions like the Kumbh Mela, and with five states currently involved in elections.

The country’s pandemic curve had been flattening by January and February this year but has taken a sharp upward turn since March. On 27 March, India’s confirmed active cases on the day were 62 632, the highest seen since October 2020.

Globally, India has had the third highest number of confirmed cases and deaths from covid-19 after Brazil and the US. As of 29 March, India had 12 million cases and 162 000 deaths from the disease.1

Last week, the Indian government acknowledged a “surge in covid-19 cases” and asked states to focus on “stringent containment and public health measures” including increasing testing, tracing, and vaccination. A press release from the government2 put the onus for the second wave of infections on “the laxity among everyone.” The central government has asked state governments to take this surge in infections seriously, so as to not be “frittering away” the gains of last year’s work to bring down numbers.

Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India, said there has been a “perfect storm” of reasons for the spike. “The recent rapid upswing in cases is from a confluence of careless crowd behaviours, slackening of governmental vigil, and mutations of the virus.” He said that the decline in deaths between October 2020 and January 2021, “gave rise to a popular belief that the danger has fully passed, reinforced by overly confident assertions by some experts and politicians that we have attained herd immunity.”

The western state of Maharashtra contributed the bulk of active cases in India throughout the pandemic and in this current surge. As on 28 March 2021, Maharashtra had 320 000 active cases of covid-19, far ahead of the second highest state of Kerala, which has 24 578 active cases. According to a recent government assessment,3 Maharashtra accounts for 62% of all active cases in the country.

Indian vaccines India’s ability to control the spread of covid-19 and its demand for and supply of vaccines will impact global supply. According to government data,4 74 countries are currently using vaccines made in India. In total, India has supplied 60 million doses to the world—8.1 million have been grants to counties including Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, and Nepal.4 Some 34 million have been commercial sales, and 18 million have been given to Covax. India began its covid-19 vaccination programme on 16 January. Initially, it was only for health and frontline workers. On 1 March, this was expanded to everyone older than 60, and those older than 45 who have specific comorbidities. So far, it has administered over 60 million vaccinations, placing it third globally after China and the US.5

New variants India began its genomic sequencing project for covid-19 last year but, according to a paper6 published by Indian government scientists involved in the sequencing, its pace and volume has been insufficient when compared with India’s high number of cases. A recent press statement7 from the government said that even though variants of concern have been found in India, they have not been detected in high enough numbers to either establish a direct relationship or explain the rapid surge in cases. In total, Indian government laboratories have done the genome sequencing of 10 787 samples of SARS-CoV2 to look for variants, and found 771.

Another lockdown? The Indian government has not enforced another national lockdown as it did in the early months of the pandemic, but the chief ministers of different states have not ruled it out. In Maharashtra, the chief minister Udhav Thackeray has said repeatedly that another lockdown could be imposed if case numbers continue rising. The government has instead imposed a night curfew, restricting movement after dark. Earlier this month, the state published guidelines8 insisting that private offices continue to work from home and allowing 50% of their staff to work from office. Theatres and auditoriums have also been told to function at 50% capacity. In Delhi, the national capital, the chief minister has said that a lockdown would not be a solution, and that people should “learn to live” with the disease instead.9 The Delhi government has announced that there will be random testing for SARS-CoV2 at public places. The civic corporation in Mumbai, the capital city of Maharashtra, has said the same. Fines10 for not wearing a mask have increased in some states. Many states insist on a negative RT-PCR test result for covid-19 in order to be allowed entry into the state via flight or road. Public gatherings like weddings have been given caps on how many guests can be allowed. Festival celebrations have been barred11 in public, although the restriction has not so far been strictly enforced.12

Picture taken May 13, 2020. REUTERS/Flavio Lo Scalzo/File Photo

An Italian prosecutor has accused the World Health Organization (WHO) of hindering efforts to investigate allegations that Italy failed to prepare adequately for the coronavirus pandemic.

Prosecutors in the northern city of Bergamo, the epicentre of the deadly outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020, are also looking into accusations that WHO officials helped the Italian health ministry cover up its alleged shortcomings.

""Up until now we have just been met with a rubber wall,"" prosecutor Maria Cristina Rota told Reuters.

WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier denied that the United Nations agency was obstructing justice.

""It is WHO practice to always assist local authorities in such matters if requested and as appropriate. WHO is currently reviewing a request for international judiciary assistance from the office of the public prosecutor in Bergamo,"" he said.

The case has underscored concern about health management in Italy and raised questions over whether the WHO might be susceptible to pressure from member states to suppress potentially damaging information.

Almost 116,000 people have died of COVID-19 in Italy, the second highest tally in Europe after Britain, with the country still registering hundreds of deaths each day.

Rota said the Geneva-based WHO had rebuffed an initial request for help and demanded that any queries pass through formal diplomatic channels. This was done on March 8, but prosecutors have yet to hear back, she said.

Rota said the WHO had also failed to forward summonses to its staff to give witness statements to the prosecutors. ""Indeed, it encouraged everyone not to appear,"" she said.

As an international organisation, the WHO said its staff had diplomatic immunity. Spokesman Lindmeier said prosecutors had not sent a request to waiver immunity and did not provide the context in which the summons were being issued.

DAMNING REPORT PULLED

Bergamo prosecutors last year opened an investigation into the government's handling of the crisis and are reviewing allegations that the WHO conspired with Rome to suppress a damning report by its own researchers into the alleged failings of the Italian health system.

The report was posted on the WHO website on May 13, 2020, but was withdrawn the following day. Seen by Reuters, it said Italy's pandemic plan had not been updated since 2006 and said the response of local hospitals had been ""improvised, chaotic and creative"".

Italy repeatedly reassured the WHO that it had updated the plan in the years following 2006 but did not appear to have done so, a legal source said. The Italian health ministry did not respond to a request for a comment.

Francesco Zambon, who was lead writer on the WHO report, resigned from the agency last month, telling RAI TV his position had become unsustainable after he alleged that senior officials had pressured him to water down criticism of Italy.

The WHO's Lindmeier said the report was published prematurely and that the clearance process for releasing the report was not fully followed.

""The data and information contained in the report had not received final clearance and contained inaccuracies and inconsistencies,"" he told Reuters.

""If the requested actions had been completed the report could have been published normally, or re-published respectively,"" Lindmeier said.

Prosecutors say they are investigating whether the WHO pulled the report at the request of Ranieri Guerra, a special adviser at the agency. Guerra was director general for preventive health at Italy's health ministry between 2014 and 2017 and as such was responsible for the pandemic plan.

Guerra has denied being responsible for the removal of the report. He met Bergamo prosecutors in November and legal sources said last week that he was placed under investigation for allegedly lying during questioning.

He has denied that accusation, saying in a statement to the media that he was ""astonished and embittered by this situation. I do not know what they are talking about"".

“Israel must be the next most likely. Again, it has vaccinated close to its entire population and case numbers are below even last year’s threshold.” “The surest case for green must be Gibraltar.

The head of Pfizer has said that people will “likely” need a third dose of his company’s COVID-19 shot within six to 12 months of vaccination, while defending the relatively higher cost of the jab.

CEO Albert Bourla also said annual vaccinations against the coronavirus may well be required.

“We need to see what would be the sequence, and for how often we need to do that, that remains to be seen,” Bourla told broadcaster CNBC in an interview aired on Thursday.

“A likely scenario is that there will be likely a need for a third dose, somewhere between six and 12 months and then from there, there will be an annual revaccination, but all of that needs to be confirmed,” he said, adding that variants will play a “key role”.

“It is extremely important to suppress the pool of people that can be susceptible to the virus.”

Researchers currently do not know how long vaccines provide protection against the coronavirus.

Earlier this month, Pfizer published a study that said its jab is more than 91-percent effective at protecting against the coronavirus and more than 95-percent effective against severe cases of COVID-19 up to six months after the second dose.

But researchers say more data is needed to determine whether protection lasts after six months.

Rising prices

Bourla also defended the price of his company’s vaccine, saying they are saving lives and will not be sold to poor countries for a profit.

“Vaccines are very expensive,” Bourla said in an interview with several European news outlets.

“They save human lives, they allow economies to reopen but we sell them at the price of a meal,” he was quoted as saying.

According to data released several months ago by a member of the Belgian government, the Pfizer coronavirus jab has been the most expensive one for the European Union, along with the Moderna vaccine.

Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov explained earlier this week that the vaccine’s price was rising as sales were being negotiated, costing as much as 19.50 euros ($23), up from 12 euros ($14).

The prices are in sharp contrast to the vaccine produced by British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca, which pledged not to make a profit on its product during the pandemic and sold it to the EU for less than two euros ($2.39) a unit.

Bourla did not confirm the price of the Pfizer vaccine but admitted that it was sold at a higher price to developed countries like the US or those in the EU.

“In middle-income countries, we sell it for half the price,” he said. “In poorer countries, including in Africa, we sell it at cost.”",453,2662,10,63
0,Aso repeats claim that treated Fukushima water is good to drink,https://japantoday.com/category/politics/aso-repeats-claim-that-treated-fukushima-water-is-good-to-drink,"Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso repeated his claim Friday that it is safe to drink treated radioactive water accumulating at the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant after China asked him to personally prove it.

""I'm sure that the water will be diluted so that (the tritium concentration) is one-seventh of the level safe for drinking water under the World Health Organization's guideline,"" Aso told a press conference, without responding directly to the proposal made by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian on Wednesday.

Zhao's remark at a news conference came a day after Tokyo officially decided to start releasing the treated water into the sea from the plant in northeastern Japan in two years. Aso said, ""I have heard that we will have no harm if we drink"" the treated water.

Aso refuted Zhao's criticism that the Pacific Ocean is not ""Japan's sewer,"" countering, ""So is it China's sewer? It's everyone's sea.""

Aso, a former prime minister who has doubled as finance minister since 2012, has often come under fire for gaffes and controversial statements.

According to the Japanese government's plan, the tritium will be diluted to less than 1,500 becquerels per liter, one-40th of the concentration permitted under Japanese safety standards and one-seventh of the WHO's guideline for drinking water.

In addition to China, South Korea and Taiwan have aired opposition to Japan's decision, arguing that the water will harm the marine environment, food safety and human health.

0,Third of French wine lost after rare cold snaps devastate vines,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/apr/15/agricultural-disaster-two-billion-worth-of-french-wine-production-lost-after-cold-snaps?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other,"At least a third of French wine production worth almost €2bn (£1.7bn) in sales will be lost this year after rare freezing temperatures devastated many vines and fruit crops across France, raising concerns over the climate crisis.

“This is probably the greatest agricultural catastrophe of the beginning of the 21st century,” the French agriculture minister, Julien Denormandie, said this week as the government declared an “agricultural disaster” and began preparing emergency financial measures.

The unseasonal wave of bitter frost and ice hit suddenly after a bout of warm weather, which worsened the damage. The warmth had encouraged vines and fruit trees to develop earlier than usual, only to be withered by the sudden cold.

The national federation of agricultural holders’ unions told AFP it believes at least a third of French wine production would be lost as certain grape harvests in many of France’s best-known wine-producing regions risked being decimated.

The destruction has hit a swathe of France, including Bordeaux, Burgundy, the Rhône Valley and Provence, damaging vines but also hitting growers of kiwis, apricots, apples and other fruit as well as crops such as beet and rapeseed.

Wine-makers had battled over several nights to try to save vineyards, attempting to heat up fields by lighting thousands of small fires and candles near vines and trees. This created the extraordinary spectacle of the night sky lit by rows of flames between vines.

President Emmanuel Macron tweeted a picture of vineyards lit by candles, expressing support for farmers whom he said were fighting “night after night” to protect crops.

À vous, agriculteurs qui, partout en France, avez lutté sans relâche, nuit après nuit, pour protéger les fruits de votre travail, je veux vous dire notre soutien plein et entier dans ce combat. Tenez bon ! Nous sommes à vos côtés et le resterons. pic.twitter.com/uaW9TmPxYh — Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) April 10, 2021

Michel-Henri Ratte had set alarms through several nights to light candles to protect his 9 hectares (22 acres) of biodynamic vineyards around Arbois in the Jura, eastern France. But severe frost, followed by snow, devastated the early shoots on the vines.

“We’d bought huge candles – like big paint pots of full of wax –– and we placed them between the vines and ran out to light them at 2am,” he said.

“There were still some green shoots but then the snow came. It was catastrophic. Currently, we’re looking at 100% loss on this year’s harvest. We’ll know in a month if anything has survived. We live close to nature, we’re used to dealing with changing weather, but we were damaged by cold snaps in 2017 and 2019. For it to be happening every two years, and for weather to be going swiftly from very hot to very cold, raises questions about climate change. It wasn’t normal cold, it was a polar cold, much more intense than usual.”

Ratte usually produces up to 30,000 bottles a year but might not produce a single one this year.

He said: “Covid-19 and the lockdown had already left us feeling as if time had stopped and we were in another world. We miss the social interaction, [and] customers coming to our home. During that time, the vines kept going, but now they’ve stopped too.”

Thomas Montagne, the head of the European confederation of independent winegrowers, and a producer in the Luberon, southern France, said: “There’s a sense of disillusionment because French wine producers had already been hit hard by Covid lockdowns and bar and restaurant closures. Independent producers were hit hard by the cancellation of wine fairs due to Covid. International exports have also been affected; we were already hit by the tariffs on French wine imposed by the former US president Donald Trump.”

He said winemakers felt “shock and sadness”.",644,3927,11,63
0,Russian Prosecutors Seek to Label Navalny Groups as 'Extremist',https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/04/16/russian-prosecutors-seek-to-label-navalny-groups-as-extremist-a73631,"They requested that Navalny's network of regional offices and his Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) be added to the list of ""terrorist and extremist"" organizations run by Russia's National Anti-Terrorism Committee.

Russian prosecutors on Friday asked a Moscow court to designate organizations linked to jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny as ""extremist"" in a move that could ban them in Russia and result in jail time for their members.

Navalny's supporters have faced increasing pressure in recent months after the opposition politician returned to Russia in January from Germany.

The list currently consists of 33 organizations and includes the Islamic State, the Taliban and Jehovah's Witnesses. The presence of these groups is banned in Russia and participation in them can result in lengthy prison terms.

It also accused the organizations of creating conditions for ""changing the foundations of the constitutional order"" and called their activities ""undesirable.""

""Under the disguise of liberal slogans, these organizations are engaged in creating conditions for the destabilization of the social and socio-political situation,"" the Moscow prosecutor's office said in a statement.

The 44-year-old spent five months there recovering from a near-fatal poisoning attack that he says was carried out on the orders of President Vladimir Putin.

Navalny was arrested on his return to Moscow and sentenced to two-and-a-half years behind bars on old embezzlement charges, sparking nationwide protests that saw more than 11,000 people detained by police.

His allies, however, vow to carry on.

'Mass political repression'

""Putin has just announced full-scale mass political repression in Russia,"" key aide and head of Navalny's regional network Leonid Volkov wrote on Twitter shortly after the announcement from prosecutors.

In a statement on Facebook, Volkov and FBK director Ivan Zhdanov said they had no doubts about the ruling that a ""Putin's court"" will make but said they will continue their work ""peacefully, publicly and effectively.""

Founded in 2011, FBK has already had its assets frozen in 2019 and received multiple fines over non-compliance with Russia's ""foreign agent"" law.

FBK has published numerous investigations into the wealth of Russia's elite, usually accompanying by YouTube videos.

In January, the FBK team published a two-hour investigation into a lavish palace on the Black Sea allegedly belonging to Putin, which garnered over 115 million views.

Navalny's allies and organizations are subject to frequent police raids and arrests over their political activities.

Earlier on Friday, a Moscow court sentenced to two years in jail a Navalny ally working for FBK over the publication of ""extremist"" tweets.

On Thursday, key aide Lyubov Sobol was handed one year of community service for trying to enter the home of an alleged security agent that Navalny said took part in his poisoning.

On March 31, Navalny announced a hunger strike in his penal colony, demanding adequate medical treatment for pain in his back and numbness in his legs.

His team on Monday said that Russian prison officials had threatened to start force-feeding him.

Navalny, who has lost significant weight since arriving at the facility in February, reiterated in an Instagram post on Friday that the prison authorities are threatening to force feed him.",513,3362,9,63

A 3,500 year old inscription recently unearthed in Tel Lachish is the oldest piece of writing ever found in Israel and offers unprecedented insights into the development of the first alphabets, a study published in the journal Antiquity revealed on Thursday.The writing, a combination of six letters on two distinct lines, is featured on a pottery sherd found at the site, located in the Shephelah region of south-central Israel.The artifact was discovered in 2018 during excavations conducted by the Austrian Archaeological Institute at the Austrian Academy of Sciences.“Our excavation started in 2017,” said Dr. Felix Höflmayer, lead author of the paper and co-director of the excavation at Tel Lachish. “We have been looking into obtaining a radiocarbon sequence for the transition from the Middle to the Late Bronze Age.”Tel Lachish is one of the most important archaeological sites in Israel. During that period – around the middle of the 2nd millennium BCE – it was a Canaanite center.The city is also mentioned several times in the Bible.According to the Book of Joshua, the Israelites destroyed it as they conquered the Land of Israel at the end of their wanderings in the desert after the Exodus from Egypt.Lachish later became an important Israelite city in the Kingdom of Judah, until it was destroyed by the Assyrians in the 7th century BCE.The inscription was dated very precisely to 3,500 years ago, thanks to the numerous organic samples collected with it, such as seeds, which allowed the researchers to employ radiocarbon dating.“Another inscription was found in the 1930s, which some believe might go back to 100 years earlier, but because it was excavated such a long time ago, it is not possible to use radiocarbon dating,” Höflmayer explained. “Moreover, many experts have doubts regarding the alphabet script used.”The new finding is especially significant because it narrows the gap between the earliest testimonies of alphabetic script uncovered in the Sinai region and more recent evidence of Semitic alphabets.“We know that the early alphabet was invented in Sinai in approximately the 19th century BCE,” he said. “It resurfaced in southern Levant much later, only around the 13th and 12th centuries, but we had no clues about what happened between these two periods.”Before the discovery of the inscription, experts believed that writing might have been brought by Egyptians to the Levant, as archaeologists often referred to an area that includes modern Israel, Palestinian territories, parts of Lebanon, and Jordan.“In the Late Bronze Age, between 1550 and 1200 BCE, the region was under the Egyptian empire,” said Höflmayer. “The Egyptians imposed their administrative system and their own writing, and many experts thought that the early alphabet might have been introduced in this context. But now we can see that it was already in use at least by the 15th century BCE, when there was not such large-scale Egyptian domination.”Höflmayer said that even though the letters identified on the sherd bear names and compose words that might sound familiar to a modern Hebrew speaker, the alphabet was not the Hebrew alphabet, but rather an alphabet from which the Hebrew one would evolve centuries later.The inscription bears letters that the researchers identified as ayin, bet and daled, (e-v-d) forming a word that can be “eved” – which back then, as well as in modern Hebrew, means “slave.” The second word deciphered on the sherd features nun-peh-tav, (n-p-t) or “nectar.”“All alphabets have somewhat evolved from hieroglyphs, the Phoenician one, the Hebrew one, the Greek one, the Latin one and so on,” Höflmayer said. “Now we know that the alphabet was not brought to the Levant by the Egyptian rule. Although we cannot really explain yet how it happened, we can say that it was much earlier and under different social circumstances.”",669,4480,7,63

Enlarge this image toggle caption Kin Cheung/AP Kin Cheung/AP

BEIJING — Nine veteran activists and lawmakers in Hong Kong have been sentenced to prison terms of up to 18 months because of their participation in anti-government protests nearly two years ago.

Media mogul Jimmy Lai received one year in prison, while prominent lawyers Margaret Ng and Martin Lee received suspended sentences of 12 and 11 months respectively, meaning if they are not convicted of another crime in the next two years, they will not have to spend time behind bars. The heaviest sentence of 18 months was meted out to Lee Cheuk-yan, an activist and former lawmaker.

The nine are the most prominent figures in Hong Kong to be sent to prison thus far as Beijing mounts several waves of arrests in the aftermath of widespread protests against its control of the region. They were convicted earlier this month of participating in two unauthorized but peaceful protests in August 2019.

Those protests were part of a larger political movement that began peacefully and attracted record numbers of marchers from all walks of life in Hong Kong. But demonstrations occasionally turned violent, after Beijing and Hong Kong's chief executive, Carrie Lam, refused to budge on more far-reaching demands for democratic reform, such as the ability to directly vote for Hong Kong's next leader.

Now, Beijing is enacting a series of new rules in Hong Kong to cement its hold and prevent future political opposition.

Since the protests ended early last year, China has expelled four opposition lawmakers from Hong Kong's legislature. Beijing then rammed through new rules that give it effective control over how the legislature and the region's chief executive are selected. Around 50 activists who pioneered a sweeping win for Hong Kong's pro-democratic parties and were strategizing to win bigger legislative elections have been arrested. A national security law, not yet a year old, has made political dissent effectively impossible.

""The law should give protection for rights, not take them away,"" said Margaret Ng, 73, a prominent lawyer, speaking before her sentencing.

Those sentenced are notable for not only their influence but their seniority. Eight out of the nine sentenced are over the age of 60, and all of them have, in various ways, shaped Hong Kong's political and legal landscape since it left British rule in 1997.

Also among those in court Friday were former lawmakers Au Nok-hin, Leung Kwok-hung, Leung Yiu-chung, Lee Cheuk-yan, Albert Ho and Cyd Ho.

More than 10,000 people have been arrested for their participation in 2019's protests. Most have been released on bail and have yet to be tried.

Three of those sentenced on Friday — Ng, Lee and lawmaker Ho — have been deemed by Chinese state media as part of the ""Gang of Four,"" which Beijing sees as the primary orchestrators behind the mass demonstrations.

""What we're seeing is the Hong Kong legal system is becoming basically a Hong Kong control system,"" says Mark Simon, a longtime business associate of Lai's who lives in Taiwan.

Media tycoon Lai likely faces the longest stint in prison. He has yet to be tried for six additional charges — one for alleged fraud over the office lease for his media company, Apple Media, and two charges in relation to ""colluding with foreign forces"" under the national security law Beijing implemented last June. He could face life in prison for falling foul of those laws.

Lai, a frequent visitor to Washington, D.C., has met several times with senior American officials, including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

Lai has been in jail since last December after being arrested and denied bail for his national security charge.

""He's reading a lot,"" said Simon. ""He's worried about his family's health every once in a while. But he's incredibly bored, and he would probably happy to be out of jail.""

Earlier this month, Lai released a handwritten letter from prison: ""It is precisely this that we need to love and cherish ourselves. The era is falling apart before us, and it is time for us to stand tall,"" it said.

Ho, the former lawmaker, and lawyer Martin Lee gave short comments outside the courtroom before being sentenced Friday amid shouts from both their supporters and pro-Beijing demonstrators. Ho was sentenced to one year.

""The most important thing is to continue to have hope, as long as there is hope, everything It will succeed,"" Lee said. He also told reporters outside the courtroom where he was sentenced that he had slept well the night before and was ""at peace.""",769,4643,9,63

Prof. Nancy Agmon-Levin, who conducted the study, told The Jerusalem Post that she believes “ masks blocked infectious agents and definitely pollen.”

Agmon-Levin is the head of Sheba’s Clinical Immunology, Angioedema and Allergy Unit. She said that she and her team were hearing comments from patients that they had a lot less allergies this year compared to previous years.

“We thought this is probably because of wearing masks, but thought about how we could prove the idea,” she explained. “We checked the referrals to the emergency department due to asthma, of which 80% to 90% of all asthma patients are due to allergies.”

While there were such large decreases in asthma referrals, there was only around a 10% decrease in overall emergency department referrals during the same period.

Likewise, when looking at the first quarter of the year, pollution levels appear very similar to every other year, she said.

Allergies affect 30% of the Israeli population, according to the Health Ministry.

“You go outside during Passover – a time in which many plants are blooming that are highly allergic in Israel – wearing a mask and most pollens will not penetrate your nose and mouth, so you will have a lot less allergies,” Agmon-Levin said. “It’s a nice idea that you can decrease exacerbation from pollen with something that costs 90 agorot compared to the drugs we usually give patients that are very expensive and have many more adverse effects.”

This is the second Israeli study published on the subject. A separate report was released late last year by the Galilee Medical Center and Bar-Ilan University that was published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and showed that 40% of 215 nurses who wore either surgical masks or N95 masks experienced less sneezing and suffered less from having runny or stuffy noses.

0,Canada's Most Helpful Vaccine Resource Is a DIY Twitter Account,https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/v7e45m/canadas-most-helpful-vaccine-resource-is-a-diy-twitter-account-vaccine-hunters-canada,"The Vaccine Hunters Twitter page superimposed on a posts thanking the account for helping them find information. Photos via screenshots.

In response to incredible government ineptitude, four volunteers built Canada’s go-to COVID-19 vaccine resource almost overnight.

Vaccine Hunters Canada blew up on Twitter and Discord this week, with many of its 30,000 followers saying they never would have been able to get themselves or their family members vaccinated without it.

The small team has been posting up-to-date information on how and where to get vaccinated across the country, including last-minute changes and availabilities, bringing relief to people desperately waiting to get the shot.

“I hope you understand how amazing a service you’re performing for the community,” one person wrote on Twitter. Another posted, “Thank you so much @VaxHuntersCan I feel like I can finally breathe for the first time in over a year.”

Kerry Bowman, who teaches bioethics and global health at the University of Toronto, said the fact that so many Canadians are turning to a DIY social media account for vaccine information speaks to confusion and frustration with the vaccine rollouts, which are largely the responsibility of the provincial governments.

“It’s been poor planning, it’s been a fractured system and the public health communication has not been that clear,” he said.

“It didn’t have to be this bad. When you look at Britain and parts of the United States, it’s not perfect but they’re moving ahead.”

About 21 percent of Canadians have received at least one shot as of April 13, according to online research publication Our World in Data. By comparison, the United Kingdom is at 48 percent and the U.S. at 37 percent. Israel, at 62 percent, is the global vaccination leader.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau maintains all Canadians can be vaccinated by the end of September.

Bowman said the federal government got a slow start by failing to negotiate contracts with pharmaceutical companies in a timely fashion (or produce its own vaccine), and that Canada’s sprawling geography and the division of responsibilities between federal and provincial governments made things complicated from the outset.

Ambiguity around who is considered vulnerable, how to define an essential worker, and what health conditions qualify someone for a vaccine have contributed to further confusion, Bowman said, while online and telephone booking systems have been plagued with problems.

Thankfully, for all the incompetence at the top, we still have the unpaid labour of the working class.

Software developer Joshua Kalpin is one of four people currently running Vaccine Hunters Canada, on top of a full-time job. He got involved two weeks ago after an intensive search to find vaccines for family members.

Modeled off the American site vaccinehunter.org, the account often makes multiple posts an hour, giving its followers real-time information when there’s a pop-up site, an appointment slot that needs filling, a possibility of vaccine wastage or a change in eligibility criteria.

The team uses TweetDeck to aggregate real-time information from public health units and hospital networks across Canada, scours Reddit for helpful posts, and gets a growing stream of tips from the public that it verifies before posting.

“The best help anybody can get is from their community,” Kalpin said.

“People are scared, people want these vaccines so, so, so badly.”

He recognizes that only so many people can be reached online, and urges the account’s followers to spread the word to the less tech-savvy.

“Reach out to every single person you know—friends, family, coworkers, community, neighbours—and help them get their shot. That’s how we get out of this.”

Bowman said Vaccine Hunters Canada is part of a “fabulous” emerging network of COVID-19 volunteerism, citing stories of neighbours doorknocking to help seniors navigate vaccine booking systems.

0,Report: Iran is a Major Transit Point for the Global Meth Trade,https://www.occrp.org/en/daily/14235-report-iran-is-a-major-transit-point-for-the-global-meth-trade,"Iran’s role as a key node in the smuggling routes for methamphetamines from Central and South-East Asia to Europe has left the country with a significant drug problem, a recent EU report found.

More than 111 processing factories were shut down in the country in 2019 and 2020 alone, but several more are believed to still be in operation. (Source: Wikimedia Commons)“Iranian Drug Control Headquarters (DCHQ) reported that in 2019, an estimated 2.8 million Iranians (5.4 % of the adult population aged 15-65) were living with substance use disorders,” the report said.



Hundreds upon hundreds of tons of the drug have been seized by Iranian authorities as it has been passing through the country. It nevertheless keeps coming.

“Over the past decade, Iran is considered to have been an important source country of methamphetamine for domestic consumption and trafficking to external markets,” read the report.

While in recent years the drug is largely produced elsewhere, it is in Iran that it is processed into its final form and converted from liquid into crystalline form. More than 111 processing factories were shut down in the country in 2019 and 2020 alone, but several more are believed to still be in operation.

The U.S. withdrawal from the so-called “Iran Nuclear Deal” under the Trump administration hasn’t helped matters either. As international sanctions were re-imposed, the country’s economy has become more and more reliant on cross border smuggling especially by Kurdish couriers known as Kolbars. They ferry goods, both legal and illegal, through the mountainous region on Iran’s western border to Iraqi Kurdistan in exchange for essential supplies for their villages such as fuel and food.



“Given the reliance of the Iranian economy on cross-border smuggling and the reported transformative impact of smuggling on ethnic minorities in Iranian borderlands, it is likely that the country will continue to face challenges in its efforts to address the flow of drugs across its international borders,” the report said.",323,2040,12,63
0,Pakistan police file ‘blasphemy’ case against feminist marchers,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/16/pakistan-police-file-blasphemy-case-against-feminist-marchers,"Organisers of the annual Aurat Aazdi march on International Women’s Day condemn allegations as ‘baseless and false’.

Islamabad, Pakistan – Pakistani police have registered a blasphemy case against organisers of the feminist Aurat Azadi [Women’s Freedom] March in a northwestern city, while a court in the country’s second city dismissed the same charges as having no grounds.

Police in the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar registered the First Information Report (FIR) under the country’s strict blasphemy laws, which can carry a mandatory death penalty, on Thursday.

In a statement, organisers of the march, which is held annually to mark International Women’s Day on March 8, condemned the allegations as “baseless and false”.

“Since the March, women marchers have been met with countless death and rape threats including a leading newspaper, Daily Ummat, referring to [feminist] marchers as prostitutes and whores,” said the statement.

“These accusations and threats have now gone as far as falsely accusing us of blasphemy, an accusation that gravely endangers the lives of hundreds of women.”

Blasphemy is a sensitive subject in Pakistan, where the country’s strict laws mandate the death penalty for the crime of insulting Islam’s Prophet, and carry a life sentence for insulting Islam’s holy book, the Quran. The feminist organisers have been accused of the former offence.

In Lahore, a court dismissed a similar petition for being based on questionable video evidence and said the demonstrators’ right to protest was protected under constitutional protections for free speech.

Activists carry placards as they march during a rally to mark International Women’s Day in Lahore [File: Arif Ali/AFP] “The fact that the petitioner took offence from a vague slogan and labelled it as blasphemy reflects his own state of mind and pattern of thought,” read the order from Judge Hafiz Rizwan Aziz.

“He has alleged a very serious offence without any iota of supporting material.”

Allegations of blasphemy surfaced soon after this year’s march, appearing to be centered on doctored video and images. Organisers shared side-by-side comparisons of the original and doctored videos, the latter of which made it appear as if demonstrators were chanting against Allah.

“We are being incriminated for crimes we never committed, slogans that were never raised, and banners that were never carried,” said organisers in Thursday’s statement.

“Additionally, the incidents which are being falsely framed as blasphemous in these charges are not even from the Islamabad March and the allegations regarding them have been thoroughly debunked by both media outlets and the respective city chapters where they came up.”

Organisers said the blasphemy case was registered in Peshawar “to satisfy the bloodthirst of religious extremist vigilantes”.

This week, the far-right Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) party has held days of violent protests across Pakistan on the issue of blasphemy, demanding the French ambassador be expelled over comments by French President Emmanuel Macron last year that were perceived to be “blasphemous”.

Pakistan’s government on Thursday declared the TLP a “terrorist organisation” and cracked down on activists across the country, after at least two policemen were killed and more than 500 wounded in those protests.

The French government, meanwhile, has advised all French citizens and companies to temporarily leave Pakistan due to the security situation around the TLP’s protests.

0,Mexico’s vow to tighten border fails to deter US-bound migrants,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/apr/14/on-mexicos-southern-border-its-business-as-usual-as-us-bound-migrants-trudge-north,"Groups of men, women and children stepped off small boats and on to Mexican soil without showing their documents to anyone.

Drivers quickly bundled them into taxis which sped past an immigration office to a nearby crossroad, where the travelers climbed into a vans for the next leg of their journey toward the US border.

Mexico has announced it is imposing new travel restrictions on its southern border, because of the coronavirus – its first such restrictions since the pandemic began. It has also deployed police, national guard members and immigration officers to its southern states to slow the flow of migrants from Central America.

This week the White House announced that Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala would deploy troops “to make crossing the borders more difficult” as the Biden administration enlists its southern neighbours in its attempts to slow migration.

But on a recent morning it looked like business as usual on this remote stretch of the Mexico-Guatemala border, which follows the mighty Usumacinta River. Packs of haggard people trod along a narrow highway through the Lacandón jungle, toting backpacks and water bottles and occasionally perching toddlers on their shoulders.

Police checkpoints dot the 150km stretch of Highway 307 from Frontera Corozal to Palenque – the site of impressive Mayan ruins. But migrants said they simply paid to pass through – or were robbed by the officers they met.

“They’ve taken our money and now we’re dead broke,” said Christian, 27, who was traveling with a group of Honduran construction workers. “And now we have to deal with the military. We need to figure out how we get north. We are always fighting and figuring out a way to get there.”

Shortly after taking office in 2018, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador declared that Mexico’s migration and customs forces were “rotten to the core” and pledged a clean-up.

But human rights activists say soldiers, police officers and immigration officials are still guilty of crimes against migrants, ranging from robbery to extortion and kidnap for ransom.

“It’s a cartel,” said Father Gabriel Romero, director of La 72, a shelter for migrants near the Guatemala border. “They’re acting in cahoots with smugglers… with taxi and bus drivers. It’s a network taking advantage of migrants.”

Mexico has once again become a stopgap in US efforts to slow migration. And migrants have become a bargaining chip in the bilateral relationship.

Analysts say Mexico’s deployment of security forces to the southern border is yet another example of the US government outsourcing immigration enforcement to its neighbour.

“We’ve turned into a very strong and very heavy control apparatus, largely due to pressure from the US government,” said Tonatiuh Guillén López, a Mexican academic and former immigration commissioner.

The number of migrants arriving at the US border dropped under previous enforcement efforts, including one that followed a high-profile increase of migrant children reaching the US border in 2014, and the deployment of the National Guard after Donald Trump threatened to impose crippling sanctions if migration wasn’t stopped.

But such crackdowns have never completely stopped the flow of people, instead forcing migrants to take riskier routes through remote regions and exposing them to a heightened risk of robbery, rape, abduction and death.

Guillén, who resigned as immigration commissioner in June 2019 after Mexico buckled under Trump’s threats, expressed doubts that the country’s enforcement efforts would work as effectively this time around. “The flow of migrants will continue moving, mostly because they’re in small groups ... and a significant part of it is controlled by human traffickers,” he said.

Human traffickers, he said, “have infrastructure, money and complicit relationships [with the authorities].” Additionally, “governments in Mexico, the United States and Central America have never really put much of an effort into controlling these trafficking organisations”.

After a call last week with US Vice-President Kamala Harris, López Obrador said: “We are willing to join forces in the fight against human trafficking and to protect human rights, especially of children.”

The two leaders also said they had agreed to work toward Central American development and “agreed on the urgency of carrying out emergency humanitarian aid programs”.

We made it here without eating. We’re drinking out of puddles Leticía, Honduran migrant

But whatever measures are agreed by the US and Mexican governments, they are unlikely to outweigh the many factors pushing Central Americans to feel their homes.

Migrants on the road through southern Mexico described escaping situations of abject poverty, hunger and violence. They described crops destroyed by drought and entire neighbourhoods devastated by hurricanes. They also spoke bitterly of politicians who oversee rampant corruption.

“Hurricane Eta swept away everything and left us in the street with our children,” said Leticia, 34, standing along the highway with her husband, Hector, and their three children aged 11, 12 and 14. “That’s why we decided to leave and search for a future.”

Johan Martínez, 34, said he had fled extortion payments in Honduras, despite lacking much of an income from his work as a welder. He pulled up his white singlet to show scars on his belly from being shot, and pointed to his front teeth. “Fake,” he said, explaining he had been hit with a pipe by angry gangsters seeking payment.

Like many of the migrants heading north, he seemed buoyed by the arrival of Biden, whose taking office he called “the opportunity of a lifetime”.

But getting out of Frontera Corozal was no easy task. Martínez and six fellow travellers paid taxi drivers 50 pesos for the privilege of walking through the town of 5,000 people – this after already paying to pass through migration checkpoints the length of Guatemala, he said. “It’s money, money, money,” he said.

The extent of human trafficking is easy to spot in Frontera Corozal, a scruffy tourist outpost populated by indigenous Chol families.

One local business owner, who preferred anonymity for security reasons, estimated that trafficking in migrants underpins 90% of the town’s economy.

He pointed to the crossroads, which was chockablock with migrants getting out of cabs and climbing into vans.

The vans paid 3,000 pesos to pass through various checkpoints, the business owner said. And when there’s a convoy of vans, “the checkpoints are only staffed so they can charge them,” he said.

The business owner sees migrants walking through the jungle around the perimeter of his property to avoid checkpoints. He provides them with food and water at a restaurant he operates and permits them to sleep in an abandoned vehicle.

But he serves smugglers, too. He broke from an interview to sell cans of beer to a pair of smugglers arriving in a new model car – part of a fleet of vehicles the smugglers used to discreetly move migrants, he said.

Migrants too poor to pay the smugglers end up walking – though they end up paying officials – who migrants say rifle through their backpacks and relieve them of their meagre belongings.

“The first thing they steal are cellular phones,” said Leticía, the Honduran migrant walking the highway with her family. She and her family had already been walking for two days in the sweltering heat and they were running out money.

“We made it here without eating. We’re drinking out of puddles.”

The sun was starting to set, and they still had 25km to go to reach the next migrant shelter. They turned north and started walking.",1269,7979,10,63
0,Duterte urged to confront Chinese ‘bullying’ in South China Sea,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/16/duterte-urged-to-confront-chinese-bullying-in-south-china-sea,"Manila urged to shore up its exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea by building structures within its waters or risk losing them to China.

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte must end his “policy of subservience” towards Beijing, lawmakers and foreign policy experts have said, warning that the Filipino leader’s silence is sending the wrong signal as hundreds of Chinese “maritime militia” vessels continue to congregate within Manila’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the South China Sea.

While several Filipino officials, including the country’s top diplomat and the defence chief, have openly demanded that the Chinese vessels immediately leave the country’s waters, Duterte has kept quiet for weeks.

During an address on Thursday night, Duterte did not mention the South China Sea. His spokesman said earlier that the president preferred to pursue his “diplomatic initiatives” in “private”.

Earlier on Thursday, the Philippine Coast Guard revealed that despite repeated demands by Manila that Chinese ships leave Whitsun Reef, at least 240 Chinese vessels remained in the area and surrounding waters as recently as Wednesday.

The vessels were first spotted on March 7 at Whitsun Reef, which is about 320km (200 miles) west of Palawan Island and within the Philippine EEZ as defined by the International Court of Arbitration at The Hague. Since the first reported sighting, the vessels have dispersed in an even wider area.

In a statement on Thursday, Senator Leila de Lima, an opposition member, warned that the Philippines could become “just another one of China’s satellites” if Duterte and the military failed to confront China.

De Lima said despite the expression of support by the United States towards Manila’s position in the South China Sea, Duterte’s “policy of grovelling before China” could prove detrimental to the integrity of the Philippine territory.

For almost 70 years, the Philippines has maintained a mutual defence pact with the US. But since Duterte came to office in 2016, he has nurtured closer ties with China, and has openly showed his disdain towards Washington, even threatening to end the US-Philippine military alliance.

Risa Hontiveros, another opposition senator, said it was time for Duterte to confront his “best friend” China, for its “blatant deception”.

“China is truly intent on refusing any diplomatic means of resolving our disputes,” she said.

The Chinese embassy in Manila has insisted that what it has called “fishing vessels” are only “seeking shelter” near the reef due to bad weather, adding that the area has been a traditional fishing ground of Chinese fishermen and that it is part of China’s Nansha Islands or Spratlys, which is also disputed.

‘Speak up’

Retired Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio, an international law expert, said unless Duterte speaks and defends the country’s sovereignty, China will not take the Philippines position seriously.

“THE PRESIDENT MUST SPEAK, HE MUST STAND UP HIMSELF, IF HIS SUBORDINATES DO THE TALKING CHINA WILL NOT LISTEN” Ret SA Justice Antonio Carpio says China will only take PH seriously if PDuterte speaks & demands withdrawal of its 246 militia vessels in EEZ of WPS #ANCHeadstart pic.twitter.com/DQhIePvd7z — Karen Davila (@iamkarendavila) April 15, 2021

“He must stand up himself. Because if his subordinates do the talking, China will not listen. And if the president is silent, then China will continue … the Chinese will take us seriously if the president will speak,” Carpio said in an interview with ABS-CBN News Channel on Thursday.

Carpio, who was part of the Philippine team that won a favourable ruling at The Hague in 2016, also dismissed China’s claim that the vessels within the Philippine EEZ are involved in fishing.

“The maritime militia vessels are manned by maritime militia under the payroll of the Chinese government. In fact, the maritime militia are placed under the command of the [Chinese] navy,” he said.

The Hague tribunal has said the Philippines has exclusive control of the resources within its EEZ. That ruling, however, was dismissed as “null and void” by China, which continues to claim almost all of the South China Sea under its so-called “nine-dash line”.

‘Weak approach’

If the “weak approach” of the Duterte administration in confronting China continues, more features within the Philippines’ EEZ could be taken over by other countries as well in the future, said Liz Derr, co-founder and CEO of Simularity, a US-based geospatial company that has been monitoring incursions in the South China Sea.

China has already built naval and air facilities on an artificial island on top of the Mischief Reef, which is also within the Philippine EEZ. China has also created an island at Scarborough Shoal, which was controlled by the Philippines until 2012.

“Unfortunately, the Philippines is weak. We’ve seen and documented what other claimants have been doing to shore up their claims,” Derr told an online forum organised by the Manila-based think-tank, Stratbase ADR Institute for Strategic and International Studies.

“We’ve seen how much weaker the Philippines is in protecting [its] territory, compared to the other claimants. If this weakness continues, we will surely see more features being occupied by other countries,” she pointed out.

The Chinese embassy in Manila has insisted that the ‘fishing vessels’ present in the Philippine EEZ are only ‘seeking shelter’ due to bad weather, adding that the area has been a traditional fishing ground of Chinese fishermen and that it is part of China’s Nansha Islands or Spratlys, which is also disputed [Philippine Coast Guard]

Shore up EEZ

Compared with the Philippines, Vietnam has shored up its sovereign rights over its own EEZ by building 29 outposts in the Spratlys, she pointed out. Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also claim parts of the South China Sea.

Derr conceded that it would be unlikely for the Philippines to recover the artificial islands built by other countries, including China, within Manila’s EEZ.

She urged the Philippine government to protect its own EEZ by occupying the unoccupied Spratly features.

Carpio, the former Supreme Court justice, agrees.

“Otherwise, China will beat us,” he said. “China will just put up something there, and there’s nothing we can do. We should put up structures within our EEZ.”

Meanwhile, former Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert del Rosario said in a statement on Thursday that he shares the concern of former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that the Philippines could become a “subject” of China if it does not stand up to Beijing’s “duplicity and being a bully”.

“In our opinion, Secretary Clinton is absolutely correct in expressing her fear that the Philippines could become a subject of China. To the last Filipino, under the leadership of [Foreign Affairs] Secretary [Teodoro] Locsin and [Defense] Secretary [Delfin] Lorenzana, we must finally stand up to Beijing’s duplicity and being a bully,” del Rosario said.

In an interview published on Tuesday, Clinton told the Philippine news website Rappler that she worried the Philippines would become “basically a subject of China through financial investments, through the buying of influence, through the undermining of institutions”.

“I think that there’s a real danger that, left unchecked, the Philippines – no matter who the leader is – would find itself increasingly unable to act without Chinese approval. I don’t think that’s the kind of future that the Philippines would like,” Clinton told Rappler’s Maria Ressa.",1198,7570,10,63
0,Dominic Raab: UK fully supports Czech hunt for Skripal suspects,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/18/dominic-raab-uk-fully-supports-czech-hunt-for-skripal-suspects,"The British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said the UK stood in “full support” of the Czech Republic after the country’s police announced they were hunting two Russians, suspected of carrying out the Salisbury poisonings, in relation to an explosion at an arms depot.

The Czech authorities said on Saturday they were seeking Alexander Petrov, 41, and Ruslan Boshirov, 43, in connection with a previously unexplained 2014 explosion at a munitions dump in Vrbětice, which left two dead.

The duo are believed to be Russian GRU officers – real names Alexander Mishkin and Anatoliy Chepiga. They entered the UK under the names of Petrov and Boshirov in the run-up to the poisoning of former GRU officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, and were also present on Czech territory in October 2014, when the explosion occurred.

Raab praised the Czechs, who had “exposed the lengths that the Russian intelligence services will go to in their attempts to conduct dangerous and malign operations in Europe” – and hinted that he believed the same GRU cell was behind both plots.

“This shows a pattern of behaviour by Moscow, following the novichok attack in Salisbury,” Raab added. “We are as determined and committed as ever to bring those responsible for the attack in Salisbury to justice, and commend the actions of the Czech authorities to do the same.”

Western intelligence sources are confident that the Czech authorities’ investigation is well-founded, and argue that it demonstrates growing evidence of the activities of the 29155 GRU unit, specialising in deadly undercover operations across Europe.

Since the election of Joe Biden as US president, the west has become increasingly loud in calling out Russian spy plots. Last week, the US announced the expulsion of 10 Russian diplomats and alongside the UK accused the Kremlin of being behind the the SolarWinds cyberattack.

According to Czech media, detectives investigating the explosion initially assumed it was a tragic accident. Two men working at the depot – Vratislav Havránek and Luděk Petřík – died instantly when 50 tonnes of ammunition blew up.

Last year, however, investigators from Prague’s counter-intelligence service and the national centre against organised crime received new information. They discovered Mishkin and Chepiga – using the Petrov and Boshirov passports – had been in the country when the explosion took place.

The pair flew in from Moscow on 11 October 2014 on a regular Aeroflot flight. They left five days later – the day of the explosion – and went home via Austria. They emailed the depot in advance to arrange a visit and booked into a hotel in the nearby city of Ostrava.

The GRU officers sent scanned passports to depot managers issued in two further names – Ruslan Tabarov from Tajikistan and Nicolaj Popa from Moldova. Unusually, their email contained no metadata. The photos matched Chepiga and Mishkin.

Police believe the undercover GRU officers visited the arms complex. They have been unable to prove this since all evidence was destroyed. At the time weapons were being unloaded for a delivery to a Bulgarian arms dealer, Emilian Gebrev, who was supplying them to the Ukrainian army.

One source told the Czech magazine Respekt that the explosion in the warehouse may have happened prematurely. “It was probably not meant to take place in the Czech Republic, but only later during the transport of weapons to another country,” the source said.

Gebrev was poisoned in May 2015 after going for dinner in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia. Bulgarian prosecutors claim three undercover GRU operatives had checked into a hotel overlooking Gebrev’s office. One of them was Sergei Fedotov – real name Denis Sergeev – who flew to London at the time of the Salisbury poisonings.

Western intelligence has suspected the same GRU unit of being involved in the poisoning of Gebrev for some time, although the link to the explosion is new. It also believes members of unit 29155 were involved in a failed coup in Montenegro in 2016 and disinformation operations in Moldova in 2014.

Around 15 to 20 elite GRU officers are thought to make up the unit, which has a secret HQ in the Skhodnya area of Moscow. It functioned as a diversionary cell, sent deep behind enemy lines, with a base in south-east France, close to the Swiss border. After Salisbury, it appears to have been disbanded.

On Saturday the Czech government kicked out 18 Russian diplomats from Moscow’s embassy in Prague. It said it would brief its Nato counterparts at a meeting this week, amid signals that it plans to take a much tougher line over the Kremlin’s regular espionage activities.

Russia dismissed accusations that it was behind the 2014 depot explosion as unfounded and absurd. It said it would retaliate for the moves against its embassy staff and on Sunday announced the expulsion of 20 Czech diplomats. It accused Prague of trying to ingratiate itself with Washington by carrying out provocative “anti-Russian actions”.

Moscow also denies the GRU was involved in the attempted murders of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. The two men known as Petrov and Boshirov said in a television interview that their visit to Britain in 2018 was innocent.

They told the Russian TV network RT they were only in Salisbury as tourists to visit the cathedral, which they described as “famous for its 123-metre spire”. If they visited the site of the poisoning, it was a coincidence, they said.

Quick Guide What is novichok? Show Novichok refers to a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 80s to elude international restrictions on chemical weapons. Like other nerve agents, they are organophosphate compounds, but the chemicals used to make them, and their final structures, are considered classified in the UK, the US and other countries. The most potent of the novichok substances are considered to be more lethal than VX, the most deadly of the familiar nerve agents, which include sarin, tabun and soman. Novichok agents work in a similar way, by massively over-stimulating muscles and glands. Treatment for novichok exposure would be the same as for other nerve agents, namely with atropine, diazepam and potentially drugs called oximes. The chemical structures of novichok agents were made public in 2008 by Vil Mirzayanov, a former Russian scientist living in the US, but the structures have never been publicly confirmed. It is thought they can be made in different forms, including as a dust aerosol. The novichoks are known as binary agents because they only become lethal after mixing two otherwise harmless components. According to Mirzayanov, they are 10 to 100 times more toxic than conventional nerve agents. Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images Europe

The open-source website Bellingcat revealed Chepiga and Mishkin’s real identities and also discovered they had both been made “heroes of Russia”. Mishkin’s grandmother told neighbours she had a photo of him collecting his award and shaking hands with Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin.

It had been thought the decoration was in recognition for Mishkin and Chepiga’s secret work in Ukraine and Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014 in a shadowy military operation. It now appears the award may have been connected to the Czech warehouse explosion.

The Skripals suddenly fell ill in March 2018, with international investigations confirming they had been poisoned with the novichok nerve agent made by Russia.

The Skripals survived the attack, but a British woman, Dawn Sturgess, died after her partner picked up the discarded, modified perfume bottle in which the poison was hidden and gave it to her mistakenly as a gift.

0,Jaffa: Arabs clash with Jewish protesters after attack on rabbi,https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/304584,"Members of the local Religious Zionist community in Jaffa gathered Sunday evening to protest the attack on two yeshiva officials earlier today.

Protesters denounced the violent assault on Rabbi Eliyahu Mali and Moshe Schendowich, and called on authorities to take a firm hand against lawlessness in Jaffa.

Some protesters struck a defiant tone, saying that the local religious community would not be bullied or driven out by Arab attacks. “You won’t defeat us that easily,” protesters said.

A group of Arab counter-protesters also gathered, chanting ""Settlers, go home,"" and ""Allahu Akbar"".

The Arab counter-demonstration turned violent at one point, with some rioters hurling stones and shooting fireworks at the Jewish demonstrators and at police.

Officers kept the two groups separated from each other during the demonstration.

Rabbi Mali, the dean of the local Hesder yeshiva, and Schendowich, the yeshiva’s director, were attacked Sunday afternoon on a Jaffa Street by a group of local Arab men.

The assailants beat and kicked the two yeshiva officials while the two were en route to inspect a local property the yeshiva is purchasing from a Jewish seller.

The attackers surrounded the two and proceeded to harass and mock Rabbi Mali and Schendowich.

When Rabbi Mali and Schendowich took out their cellular phones to call for help, several of the Arabs assaulted them, punching and kicking the two victims.

Schendowich was injured in the attack, and was hospitalized afterwards.

Rabbi Mali filed a police complaint shortly after the assault.

Roughly one hour after the complaint was filed, police managed to locate and apprehend two Arab suspects.

The suspects have been identified as residents of Jaffa in their 30s.

“They punched and kicked me,” said Schendowich in an interview with Channel 13, emphasizing that the attack was nationalistically-motivated. “When people scream at you because you’re wearing a kippah, that you’re a ‘settler’ and that you should get out of there, that doesn’t seem like a ‘criminal’ incident.”

Diaspora Minister Omer Yankelevich (Blue and White) warned of a “quiet Intifada” targeting religious Jews.

“Under our noses there has been a quiet Intifada against visibly religious or haredi Jews. I call on the police to crush this violence with an iron fist. Jews shouldn’t have to be afraid to go in the street. We’re finished with the exile.”",380,2395,10,63
0,Beijing anger as pro-democracy documentary wins Oscar-nomination,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/18/beijing-anger-as-pro-democracy-documentary-wins-oscar-nomination,"Anders Hammer moved to Hong Kong in 2019 to capture a David versus Goliath battle on camera, filming pro-democracy protesters in the city taking on autocrats in Beijing.

Little over a year later he became an inadvertent protagonist in that fight, when his low budget documentary Do Not Split won an Oscar nomination.

Chinese authorities, apparently enraged or worried by the platform the star-studded evening might give the film, and by long-deleted comments from best director nominee Chloé Zhao, has reportedly told local media not to broadcast the ceremony live, and play down all coverage of the awards.

Hammer is bemused at the lengths to which China has gone to stop its citizens catching even a brief glimpse of his latest film. In the rest of the world, that move has earned him the type of press coverage he could never have dreamt of.

“We are part of a category, short documentaries, which is not normally one that gets most attention [in Oscar coverage],” he said. “It’s ironic Beijing is actually at this point promoting our documentary.”

His half-hour exploration of the protest is beautifully filmed in a fluid, intimate style that takes the viewer into the intense heart of street demonstrations.

Millions marched in peace through Hong Kong’s streets in the summer of 2019, originally spurred by anger at a law that would have allowed the city to extradite people to face trial in the mainland’s opaque and judicial system.

As the protests expanded into broader demands for democracy, the police response became increasingly brutal. By the end of the year students were besieged in their university campus, stuffing molotov cocktails to take on police who were now liberal with their use of tear gas, rubber bullets and even live ammunition.

Coronavirus brought the public demonstrations to an abrupt end, and soon afterwards Beijing passed a security law for Hong Kong that effectively ended the city’s limited autonomy and has been used to crush the pro-democracy movement.

Key figures are mostly in jail, in exile or awaiting trial. Even protest slogans and songs have been banned under the new legislation. The Norwegian director believes Beijing’s fear of a short documentary, even after this comprehensive crackdown, is a tribute to the protest movement’s enduring power.

“It was the biggest revolt against Beijing, and the political leadership [there] in a very long time,” Hammer said. “I think that the [Chinese leadership] is very afraid that this could spread in some way and that you would see similar actions being taken in mainland China … the fear that someone will be inspired to try to do the same.”

The star of the film, if that is the right word for a documentary about a grassroots protest movement that deliberately eschewed leader figures, is Joey Siu. She talks eloquently about how she became an accidental student activist, setting aside plans to teach as the fight for her city’s future became more urgent.

Most of the young protesters on the frontlines chose to stay anonymous over fears of retaliation that have proved well founded. Siu decided to go public, and continue to speak out, at huge personal cost.

“Ever since 2019, when I first went public [with my identity], I have been receiving a lot of harassment … and my personal information, or even information about my family members have been posted and circulated online,” she said.

The video that ends the film is the last one Siu recorded in Hong Kong. She realised she was being followed, and watched friends arrested – some as they tried to flee – and soon after decided to leave for the US.

Yet somehow, like others in the movement, she clings to hope that while they may have lost the battle for Hong Kong, they still have a chance in the long-term war for democracy.

“We understand that the situation in Hong Kong is not going to become any better, we’re pretty sure that the Chinese Communist party is not planning to restore any kinds of freedom or rights that we used to enjoy,” Siu said.

“But we are very determined to explore other possibilities to sustain the struggle.” The new focus includes lobbying for political support, organising protests where that is still possible – beyond China’s borders – and building solidarity.

The name of the documentary is taken from a protest motto, emphasising the need for unity in the face of pressure from Beijing. That commitment endures, and she is grateful that a film she took part in to document their struggle, is now also helping support it.

“All of us understand that this is going to be a very long and very difficult battle so we are trying our very best to sustain the momentum that we built in 2019,” she said.

“The Oscar nomination has galvanised a lot of attention from people across the globe, who might not have been paying attention to what has been going on in Hong Kong.”",827,4863,7,64
0,US set to brand Taiwan as currency manipulator even as ties warm,https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Markets/Currencies/US-set-to-brand-Taiwan-as-currency-manipulator-even-as-ties-warm,"NEW YORK -- Growing U.S. support for Taiwan as part of a geopolitical battle with China is not deterring Washington from branding the island as currency manipulator.

Taiwan's addition to the U.S. Treasury Department's list of manipulators in its semi-annual foreign exchange report, expected to be published on Thursday, ""appears to be consensus now,"" according to Francesco Pesole, a forex strategist with Dutch financial services firm ING Group.

In a note Wednesday, ING estimated the Taiwanese central bank's foreign exchange interventions in 2020 amounted to 5.8% of gross domestic product -- way above the 2% threshold set by the U.S. Treasury.

""We thought the Treasury already gave a free pass -- by underestimating [forex] interventions -- to Taiwan in December, possibly due to geopolitical considerations related to China's influence in the region,"" Pesole wrote, referring to the last report released by former President Donald Trump's administration.

The Taiwan dollar gained 5.6% against the greenback in 2020. But the island's currency fell sharply this week on expectations that it will be branded a manipulator -- falling more than 2% from a peak in early March.

China, despite the trade, tech and geopolitical tensions with the U.S., is set to be spared.

""China is not manipulating its currency so I expect that to be reflected in the report,"" said David Dollar, a former Treasury official who is now a senior fellow in the John L. Thornton China Center at the Washington think tank Brookings Institution.

The Treasury's new foreign exchange report will be the first under Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's leadership. At her confirmation hearing in January, Yellen vowed that she would work to fulfill President Joe Biden's promise to ""oppose any and all attempts by foreign countries to artificially manipulate currency values to gain an unfair advantage in trade.""

Even so, the Biden administration is likely to downplay tensions over exchange-rate policies with trading partners in Asia, due in part to geopolitical considerations, even though some are on the U.S. Treasury's currency manipulator list, Fitch Ratings said in a Wednesday note.

To China's chagrin, the U.S. has rapidly been drawing closer to Taiwan. Just last Friday, the State Department issued new guidelines that will enable American officials to meet more freely with their Taiwanese counterparts, ""to encourage U.S. government engagement with Taiwan that reflects our deepening unofficial relationship.""

A U.S. delegation, including former Deputy Secretaries of State Richard Armitage and James Steinberg, is currently visiting Taipei.

Last year, Taiwan's central bank started actively buying U.S. dollars following a steep appreciation of the Taiwan dollar.

In December, the Trump administration placed both Taiwan and China on its monitoring list for meeting two out of three criteria for the currency manipulator label -- a goods trade surplus with the U.S. of over $20 billion and an account surplus of more than 2% of GDP over a 12-month period.

The December report pegged Taiwan's intervention at 1.7% of GDP, 0.3 percentage point short of the 2% threshold.

As the new edition of the report looms, Taiwan's central bank has acknowledged the risk of being tagged. Gov. Yang Chin-long told parliament in March that it is ""possible"" that the U.S. will make such a designation. The last time Taiwan was named in 1992.

But Yang reassured Taiwanese lawmakers that even if Washington went forward with such a move, it would have no immediate impact on Taiwan's economy.

Speaking to parliament, Yang also maintained that Washington's large trade deficit with Taipei should be attributed to demand -- the island is a big producer of semiconductors -- rather than not exchange rates.

""We think the impact on Taiwan's economic growth would be limited because we don't expect the U.S. to impose import tariffs on goods from Taiwan,"" Oxford Economics write in a note on Thursday. ""That would weigh on bilateral relations at a time of rising cross-strait tensions with China and harm U.S. firms that rely on Taiwan's semiconductors.""

Taiwan's recent exchange-rate policies have drawn criticism from members of the Biden administration, including Brad Setser, counselor to the U.S. Trade Representative.

In 2019, Setser, then a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, published a research report alleging that Taiwan hid over $100 billion in reserves and related currency intervention from the U.S. Treasury.

""The case for the U.S. naming Taiwan a currency manipulator under the 1988 act is actually stronger than the case for naming China,"" Setser wrote in a tweet associated with the report.

Last September, Setser again maintained that there is ""an increasingly strong case"" for giving Taiwan such a designation, in reaction to a Reuters report that the island is limiting outright currency intervention by blocking forex transactions.

JPMorgan's Asia rates and forex strategy team wrote in a March note that they expect Taiwan's central bank to adopt a more hands-off approach to its currency, as it faces ""increasing pressures on both external and domestic fronts.""

Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and India were also on the Treasury's monitoring list last year, while Vietnam was tagged a currency manipulator. ING expects Vietnam's designation to continue while flagging Thailand as at risk of joining its ranks.

But ""labeling a country a manipulator is often a less effective lever than the threat of doing so,"" Mark Sobel, a former senior Treasury official and U.S. chairman of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, wrote in a March article.

The U.S. currency manipulator label does not trigger immediate penalties such as tariffs. It requires bilateral engagement on currency policies that can involve the International Monetary Fund. Such a designation, which remained fairly rare up until a few years ago, could also cause swings in foreign exchange markets.

In 2016, Congress enacted legislation to make currency manipulator determinations by a quantitative approach consisting of three metrics, in place of a more qualitative weighing. The Trump administration further adjusted the current account metric to 2% of GDP from 3%, making it easier for economies to cross the threshold.",992,6349,12,64

Enlarge this image toggle caption Weizhi Ji/Kunming University of Science and Technology Weizhi Ji/Kunming University of Science and Technology

For the first time, scientists have created embryos that are a mix of human and monkey cells.

The embryos, described Thursday in the journal Cell, were created in part to try to find new ways to produce organs for people who need transplants, said the international team of scientists who collaborated in the work. But the research raises a variety of concerns.

""My first question is: Why?"" said Kirstin Matthews, a fellow for science and technology at Rice University's Baker Institute. ""I think the public is going to be concerned, and I am as well, that we're just kind of pushing forward with science without having a proper conversation about what we should or should not do.""

Still, the scientists who conducted the research, and some other bioethicists defended the experiment.

""This is one of the major problems in medicine — organ transplantation,"" said Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, a professor in the Gene Expression Laboratory of the Salk Institute for Biological Sciences in La Jolla, Calif., and a co-author of the Cell study. ""The demand for that is much higher than the supply.""

""I don't see this type of research being ethically problematic,"" said Insoo Hyun, a bioethicist at Case Western Reserve University and Harvard University. ""It's aimed at lofty humanitarian goals.""

Thousands of people die every year in the United States waiting for an organ transplant, Hyun noted. So, in recent years, some researchers in the U.S. and beyond have been injecting human stem cells into sheep and pig embryos to see if they might eventually grow human organs in such animals for transplantation.

But so far, that approach hasn't worked. So Belmonte teamed up with scientists in China and elsewhere to try something different. The researchers injected 25 cells known as induced pluripotent stem cells from humans — commonly called iPS cells — into embryos from macaque monkeys, which are much more closely genetically related to humans than are sheep and pigs.

After one day, the researchers reported, they were able to detect human cells growing in 132 of the embryos and were able study the embryos for up to 19 days. That enabled the scientists to learn more about how animal cells and human cells communicate, an important step toward eventually helping researchers find new ways to grow organs for transplantation in other animals, Belmonte said.

""This knowledge will allow us to go back now and try to re-engineer these pathways that are successful for allowing appropriate development of human cells in these other animals,"" Belmonte told NPR. ""We are very, very excited.""

Such mixed-species embryos are known as chimeras, named for the fire-breathing creature from Greek mythology that is part lion, part goat and part snake.

""Our goal is not to generate any new organism, any monster,"" Belmonte said. ""And we are not doing anything like that. We are trying to understand how cells from different organisms communicate with one another.""

In addition, Belmonte said he hopes this kind of work could lead to new insights into early human development, aging and the underlying causes of cancer and other disease.

Some other scientists NPR spoke with agree the research could be useful.

""This work is an important step that provides very compelling evidence that someday when we understand fully what the process is we could make them develop into a heart or a kidney or lungs,"" said Dr. Jeffrey Platt, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Michigan, who is doing related experiments but was not involved in the new research.



But this type of scientific work and the possibilities it opens up raises serious questions for some ethicists. The biggest concern, they said, is that someone could try to take this work further and attempt to make a baby out of an embryo made this way. Specifically, the critics worry that human cells could become part of the developing brain of such an embryo — and of the brain of the resulting animal.

""Should it be regulated as human because it has a significant proportion of human cells in it? Or should it be regulated just as an animal? Or something else?"" Rice University's Matthews said. ""At what point are you taking something and using it for organs when it actually is starting to think and have logic?""



Another concern is that using human cells in this way could produce animals that have human sperm or eggs.

""Nobody really wants monkeys walking around with human eggs and human sperm inside them,"" said Hank Greely, a Stanford University bioethicist who co-wrote an article in the same issue of the journal that critiques the line of research while noting that this particular study was ethically done. ""Because if a monkey with human sperm meets a monkey with human eggs, nobody wants a human embryo inside a monkey's uterus.""

Belmonte acknowledges the ethical concerns. But he stresses that his team has no intention of trying to create animals with the part-human, part-monkey embryos, or even to try to grow human organs in such a closely related species. He said his team consulted closely with bioethicists, including Greely.

Greely said he hopes the work will spur a more general debate about how far scientists should be allowed to go with this kind of research.

""I don't think we're on the edge of beyond the Planet of the Apes. I think rogue scientists are few and far between. But they're not zero,"" Greely said. ""So I do think it's an appropriate time for us to start thinking about, 'Should we ever let these go beyond a petri dish?' ""

For several years, the National Institutes of Health has been weighing the idea of lifting a ban on funding for this kind of research but has been waiting for new guidelines, which are expected to come out next month, from the International Society for Stem Cell Research.

The notion of using organs from animals for transplants has also long raised concerns about spreading viruses from animals to humans. So, if the current research comes to fruition, steps would have to be taken to reduce that infection risk, scientists said, such as carefully sequestering animals used for that purpose and screening any organs used for transplantation.",1066,6412,10,64
0,US-funded broadcaster asks European court to block Russian fines,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/16/us-funded-broadcaster-asks-european-court-to-block-russian-fines,"Moscow has moved to penalise Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty for failing to label its reports with the ‘foreign agent’ tag.

The Moscow bureau of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) has called on Europe’s top human rights court to order Russian authorities against enforcing fines that could cost the broadcaster millions of dollars.

The multimedia news outlet, which is funded by Washington, has been heavily fined this year for what Russia says is a repeated failure to label itself as a media outlet “performing the functions of a foreign agent”.

RFE/RL says Russian authorities have the power to place it into insolvency or block access to its media sites if the fines are unpaid – or do both.

Andrey Shary, its general director, faces the prospect of a prison sentence of up to two years and personal bankruptcy, the network fears.

“We are hopeful that the European Court of Human Rights will view these actions by the government of Russia for what they are: an attempt to suppress free speech and the human rights of the Russian people,” RFE/RL President Jamie Fly said in a statement.

Fly added that Moscow’s actions set a “dangerous precedent at a time when independent media are under assault around the globe”.

The standoff has added to friction in Washington’s ties with Moscow that are already at post-Cold War lows, under pressure from several issues including Ukraine, Syria, sanctions and the jailing of Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny.

However, any favourable ruling by the ECHR would likely be largely symbolic as Russia passed a law last year giving its national legislation precedence over international treaties and rulings in cases when they conflict with its constitution.

‘Irreversible harm’

Since October, Russia’s communications watchdog Roskomnadzor has filed 390 violation cases against RFE/RL and is expected to announce more on Friday.

The watchdog has the power to label foreign-funded NGOs, media or individuals it deems are engaged in political activity as “foreign agents”.

Roskomnadzor has ordered RFE/RL to place a precautionary statement on its material which reads: “This report (material) was created and (or) disseminated by a foreign mass medium performing the functions of a foreign agent and (or) a Russian legal entity performing the functions of a foreign agent.”

The designation also requires publications to report their funding and spending.

The broadcaster says the watchdog’s fines for failing to carry the statement could total the equivalent of $2.4m and cause “irreversible harm”.

RFE/RL, which is funded by a grant from US Congress through the United States Agency for Global Media, argues it has full editorial independence protected by US law and that the labelling requirement amounts to defacing its own product.

“While RFE/RL has complied with all of its legal obligations under the foreign agents law, it has declined to implement this new labelling requirement, which is clearly intended to damage its reputation and viability as an independent media organisation in Russia,” the broadcaster said in a statement.

The outlet, which has a network of freelancers across Russia, covers Crimea, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014, in great detail, and provides extensive coverage – in Russian – of opposition protests and the fate of Navalny. It says it has almost doubled its Russian audience over the last five years.

The outlet, which was founded in the 1950s and was initially funded via the CIA, was for years at odds with Soviet authorities during the Cold War.

After the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s predecessor in the Kremlin, Boris Yeltsin, invited RFE/RL to open an office in Russia.

Moscow clamps down on dissent

Roskomnadzor said in a statement on Friday that compliance with the “foreign agent” law was mandatory and that the label was designed to make clear to a Russian audience that such organisations “pursue the interests of other states”.

But the law, which applies to non-governmental political organisations and media receiving foreign funding, has been widely criticised as aiming to discredit critical reporting.

Russia has recently stepped up actions that appear to be aimed at stifling dissent.

Criminal charges were filed this week against four editors of an online student magazine. The publication had posted a video connected to January’s nationwide protests calling for Navalny’s release.

A court last week fined Twitter 8.9 million rubles (about $117,000) for failing to remove posts in which users called for minors to rally in the pro-Navalny demonstrations.",732,4620,9,64
0,The staggering scale of India’s anti-Pakistan propaganda machine,https://www.trtworld.com/magazine/the-staggering-scale-of-india-s-anti-pakistan-propaganda-machine-42241,"Insight

Hundreds of fake news websites and NGOs linked to Indian entities were used to spread propaganda against Pakistan internationally.

For years Pakistan has accused its archrival India of engaging in hybrid warfare which relies on a disinformation campaign to undermine Islamabad at international forums. Now it seems much of that is true.

The EU DisinfoLab has uncovered a network of NGOs and fake media organisations linked to India that for more than a decade have been engaged in anti-Pakistan propaganda.

""It is the largest network we have exposed,"" Alexandre Alaphilippe, executive director of EU DisinfoLab told the BBC after the report “Indian Chronicles” was published on Wednesday.

Brussels-based DisinfoLab is a European NGO which aims to check the disinformation targeting the European Union, its parliamentarians and policies.

In a sophisticated operation, much of which has been linked to the New Delhi-based Srivastava Group, hundreds of fake media outlets, long-dead organisations and stolen identities were used to paint Pakistan in a negative light in the EU and elsewhere, the report says.

The revelations by @DisinfoEU on the widespread Indian network of subversive activities vindicates Pakistan's position & exposes its detractors. The international community needs to take notice of a rogue Indian regime that now threatens the stability of the global system. — Imran Khan (@ImranKhanPTI) December 10, 2020

While DisinfoLab says it has not found any connection between this campaign and the Indian state, Pakistan’s foreign office came out with a strong statement.

“India not only spread disinformation but abused international institutions in its desire to malign Pakistan,” it said.

The revelations could deepen tension further between the two neighbours who have fought three wars and have come close to another full blown conflict last year.

Resurrected to deceive

The DisinfoLab investigation found that at least ten long-defunct NGOs and industry-related organisations were resurrected and used to lobby diplomats at international forums, especially the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC).

For instance, the Commission to Study the Organisation of Peace (CDOP), an NGO that became inactive in the 1970s, was reactivated in the mid-2000s to organise events on the sidelines of UN sessions and send representatives to panel discussions.

Its origin has been linked to Srivastava Group.

In honour of #HumanRightsDay, we want to share a chapter of our recent investigation with implications for @UN_HRC.



While NGOs should definitely not be silenced, 'dead' NGOs should not be given a voice. https://t.co/M65W2YZNjc — EU DisinfoLab (@DisinfoEU) December 10, 2020

What will worry many in Islamabad is that the NGOs in question are UN accredited, something which makes them appear legitimate.

The groups are also responsible for putting up “Free Balochistan” posters across Geneva in 2017. Pakistan’s restive Balochistan province is facing an insurgency, and India often highlights the human rights violations there to deviate attention from its own atrocities in Kashmir.

The International Club for Peace Research (ICPR), another dormant NGO that focuses on Africa, was resurrected in 2009 when it started to appear at the UNHRC sessions where Pakistan was targeted.

It was this so-called NGO which in 2012 issued a press release, distributed by Indian news agency DNA, demanding “enquiry into genocide in Bangladesh by Pakistani Army.”

“The (ICPR) website refers to promoting peace and to Mother Teresa in its “about us” section, lists past events and meetings related to peace and human rights in Africa, but its “news”, “pictures” and “demonstrations” sections are entirely about human rights in Pakistan,” DisinfoLab says.

The groups ostensibly lobby around issues that are sure to cause discontent within Pakistan.

“Generally, we found several other NGOs regularly covering the same issues around minorities in Pakistan, Balochistan, Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan. For a majority of these NGOs, these issues are not part of their original mission,” it notes.

For instance, in the southern Sindh province there’s strong resentment against the construction of upstream dams. But despite it being a domestic matter, the World Sindhi Congress was invited by one of the groups at the 2018 UNHRC to speak against the dam.

The report has also raised questions about the performance of UN bureaucracy as organisations set up to represent industry groups ended up in the hands of Indians and later used solely as tools to bash Pakistan.

Take for example the Canners International Permanent Committee (CIPC), which was established to promote the canning industry but stopped functioning in 2007. It was later reactivated by the same Indian network.

“The core theme of the original NGO – “canned foods” - was totally diverted by Indian Chronicles to undermine Pakistan at the Human Rights Council,” says DisinfoLab.

Another interesting example is of the African Regional Agricultural Credit Association (ARACA), which instead of proposing ways to help farmers, has used Geneva for anti-Pakistan activities.

A Pakistani dissident, Mehran Marri, also known as Mehran Baluch, who has more than 27,000 followers on Twitter, has spoken on behalf of ARACA.

Marri, who supports Balochistan’s secession from Pakistan, has also served as the President of Balochistan House, an organisation linked to Ankit Srivastava of the Srivastava Group.

“NGOs tied to this ecosystem are also often represented by official representatives of minorities in Pakistan, who can be seen to speak for different organizations,” notes DisinfoLab.

The media connection

The Indian disinformation network relies heavily on more than 700 fake media outlets to spread propaganda of the NGOs linked to Srivastava Group.

Fake news websites such as EU Chronicles, Japan Times Today, and Arizona Herald, regularly published Pakistan-centric stories.

The DisinfoLab found that the Indian news wire agency, ANI, a partner organisation of Reuters, often helped magnify the stories published by these outlets.

Once sent out by ANI, these stories were picked up by respectable media groups such as The Times of India and The Economic Times.

A glaring example of how the propaganda works can be seen in the 2017 interview of the Pakistani diplomat Hussain Haqqani published in another fake outlet, Times of Geneva.

The story titled ‘Baloch posters in Switzerland to isolate Pakistan’ was picked up by ANI and forwarded to its subscribers. It ended up on the webpages of Outlook India magazine and the Business Standard.

0,South Korean steelmaker to end partnership with Myanmar military,https://www.wral.com/skorean-steelmaker-to-end-venture-with-myanmar-military/19629775/,"— A South Korean steelmaker on Friday said it plans to end a joint venture with a military-controlled firm in Myanmar following criticism that its business has benefited military leaders who have violently suppressed pro-democracy protests there.

POSCO Coated & Color Steel said it has decided to discontinue its partnership with Myanmar Economic Holdings Public Company Limited, which is about 40% owned by Myanmar’s Defense Ministry. However, the South Korean company said it would not pull out of Myanmar.

POSCO C&C owns 70% of its joint venture with MEHL, Myanmar POSCO C&C. Min Ji-hyun, an official from POSCO C&C, said the company has informed MEHL it wants to buy the Myanmar firm’s 30% stake so that it can continue operating the venture with full ownership. MEHL has yet to respond to POSCO C&C’s offer, Min said.

Min said he couldn’t provide detailed estimates on how much the deal would cost POSCO C&C, saying that would depend on when it goes through. He said the company will look for “other ways” to continue doing business in Myanmar if MEHL refuses to sell its stake, but did not elaborate on what those might be.

Human rights activists have been pressuring many companies around the globe to end any financial support for the military. The U.S. government has imposed sanctions on MEHL and a similar military-controlled conglomerate, Myanmar Economic Corp.

POSCO C&C is an affiliate of South Korean steel giant POSCO that manufactures steel sheets. The company issued a statement saying it hopes its steel business will “continue to contribute in improving living environments in Myanmar and facilitate the country’s economy.”

A military junta took over Myanmar from an elected civilian government in a Feb. 1 coup. Security forces have killed at least 700 civilian protesters and bystanders, have detained the former government’s leaders, and have charged doctors, entertainers and others with crimes over their opposition to the coup.

In a statement, the rights group Justice for Myanmar said it cautiously welcomed Posco C&C's decision but urged it to “immediately end all other business ties with the Myanmar military junta and its conglomerates.""

That includes rent on land leased by entities associated with the military, it said.

The statement was jointly issued with the Korean Civil Society in Support of Democracy in Myanmar, a network of more than 100 rights groups. That group said that it had joined with other advocacy organizations to file a complaint with South Korea's National Human Rights Commission and other agencies to protest business ties between Korean companies and the military. That complaint was filed in November, long before the coup.",433,2691,9,64

A senior Japanese ruling party official said on Thursday that cancelling this year’s Olympics in Tokyo remains an option if the coronavirus crisis becomes too dire.

The Tokyo Olympics Organising Committee responded with a statement saying all those involved in preparing for the Games remained fully focused on hosting them in the summer.

""If it seems impossible (to host the Olympics) any more, then we have to stop it, decisively,"" Toshihiro Nikai, secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party, said in comments to broadcaster TBS.

Cancellation is ""of course"" an option, he said, adding: ""If the Olympics were to spread infection, then what are the Olympics for?""

With Japan in the midst of a fourth wave of coronavirus infections, doubts over whether Tokyo would be able to host the Summer Games - already an unpopular idea with the public - have resurfaced in recent weeks.

Government and organising officials have consistently said the Games would go ahead.

""We do not speculate,"" an International Olympic Committee spokesperson said on Thursday. ""We are fully concentrated and committed to the successful delivery of the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 this year, and working at full speed towards the opening ceremony on July 23.""

But the fact that a ruling party heavyweight made the remark was enough to give his comments top billing on domestic news.

NIKAI EXPLANATION

""Olympics Cancelled"" was trending on Twitter in Japan with nearly 50,000 tweets from users as of Thursday afternoon.

""If this person says it, Olympics cancellation looks like a reality,"" tweeted @marumaru_clm in reference to Nikai, who is a key backer of Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and is known for his frank comments.

""Yay! This is great! Finally, it's cancelled, cancelled, cancelled!"" tweeted another user, @haruha3156.

Nikai later issued a written statement to explain his stance.

""I want the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics to succeed,"" the statement said. ""At the same time, to the question of whether we would host the (Games) no matter what, that is not the case. That's what I meant by my comments.""

Prime Minister Suga later side-stepped a reporter's question on whether cancelling was indeed an option, saying only that the government remained committed to controlling the pandemic ahead of the Olympics.

""There's no change to the government's stance, to do everything possible to prevent the spread of infections as we head towards the Olympics,"" he told reporters in Tokyo ahead of his trip to Washington to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden.

INFECTIONS SURGE

Japan is grappling with rising COVID-19 infections, with new cases in Tokyo jumping to 729 on Thursday, the most since early February.

Tokyo, Osaka and several other prefectures entered a quasi-state of emergency this month, asking bars and restaurants to shorten their hours, and four more prefectures were set to be added, local media reported.

Asked about Nikai's comments, the Tokyo Olympic organising committee said in a statement: ""Prime Minister Suga has repeatedly expressed the government's commitment to holding the Tokyo 2020 Games.

""All our delivery partners including the national government, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee, the IOC (International Olympic Committee) and the IPC (International Paralympic Committee) are fully focused on hosting the Games this summer.""

Preparations have included incorporating social distancing measures and other restrictions for the postponed Games, which are set to begin on July 23 and will be held without international spectators.

A scaled-back torch relay is already underway.

""We'll hold (the Games) in a way that's feasible,"" Taro Kono, a popular minister in charge of Japan's vaccination drive, said on a separate TV programme, according to Kyodo News. ""That may be without spectators,"" he added.

Japan's top medical adviser, Shigeru Omi, acknowledged the pandemic had entered a fourth wave, driven by mutant strains, with Kyoto University professor Hiroshi Nishiura urging in a magazine commentary that the Olympics be postponed.

Akira Koike, an opposition lawmaker with the Japanese Communist Party, reacted to Nikai's comments on Twitter saying that holding the event was already ""impossible"" and that a swift decision on cancellation should be made.

Cancelling or postponing the Games would probably not hurt Japan’s economy much but would have a larger effect on Tokyo’s service sector, a senior International Monetary Fund official said on Wednesday.

Islamabad, Pakistan – Pakistan has temporarily blocked Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp and some other social media services across the country as part of a security crackdown on a far-right religious party, officials say.

The temporary ban blocked all access to social media platforms Facebook, Twitter and YouTube and messaging apps Whatsapp and Telegram across the country starting at 11:00am local time (06:00 GMT) on Friday, an interior ministry official said.

“This was imposed in anticipation of [Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan or TLP] protests and their penetration in the social media [is very high],” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Press Release: In order to maintain public order and safety, access to certain social media applications has been restricted temporarily. — PTA (@PTAofficialpk) April 16, 2021

The official said the “temporary ban” would be lifted at 3:00pm local time (10:00 GMT), although several areas continued to report outages past that time.

A second official familiar with the issue confirmed to Al Jazeera that the services had been blocked by the government, with the country’s telecommunications regulator saying the step had been taken “in order to maintain public order and safety”.

The far-right TLP has held days of violent protests against the arrest of its leader Saad Rizvi on Monday.

Clashes between police and protesters have left at least four policemen dead and more than 600 wounded, official said on Friday.

TLP supporters throw stones over a police armoured vehicle during a protest in Islamabad [File: Aamir Qureshi/AFP] At their height, the protests saw major intercity highway closed and roads in major cities such as Karachi, the country’s largest city, the eastern city of Lahore and the capital Islamabad blocked.

Police fired water cannon, tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters as they attempted to disperse them.

The protests had largely quelled by Thursday, but limited demonstrations continued in some areas. Authorities said they feared the TLP would launch large protests following midday congregational prayers on Friday.

A day earlier, the government formally banned the TLP under anti-terrorism legislation, with the National Counter-Terrorism Authority (NACTA) adding it to Pakistan’s list of “proscribed organisations”.

Also on Thursday, the French government told citizens and French companies to leave Pakistan due to “serious threats” from the TLP protests.

In November, the TLP launched a days-long sit-in protest blocking a major highway into the capital Islamabad over remarks by French President Emmanuel Macron that many, including Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan, said “encouraged Islamophobia”.

Macron had defended publications’ right to reprint controversial caricatures of Islam’s Prophet Muhammad, an act considered “blasphemous” by some Muslims.

Founded in 2017 by firebrand cleric Khadim Hussain Rizvi, the TLP has campaigned on a one-point agenda of fighting perceived “blasphemy”, organising several mass protests across the country over its opposition to laws it considers blasphemous and the acquittal of a Christian woman of the crime of blasphemy.

The party holds three seats in the provincial assembly of the southern province of Sindh. On Thursday, the government said it would begin proceedings to have the party delisted by the Election Commission, potentially unseating those three lawmakers.

Blasphemy is a sensitive subject in Pakistan and insulting the Quran, Islam’s Prophet Muhammad or Muslim holy personages can carry a mandatory death penalty.

Since 1990, at least 78 people have been murdered in connection with blasphemy allegations across Pakistan, according to an Al Jazeera tally.

In 2016, Raul Castro said he would step down in five years but in a country that's been led by the same family for six decades, that certainly wasn't take for granted.





Just now through the 89-year-old confirmed that he will step down as the first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba in a speech at the party congress.





That will pave the way for a new generation of leadership -- none of who participated in the revolution -- to lead the country. The transition will take place this weekend and is likely to put 60-year-old Miguel Díaz-Canel in charge.









The transition is an opening for softening relations between the US and Cuba. Biden has signaled he wants to thaw the relationship after Trump reversed Obama-era reforms.





The Florida now appears to be a solidly Republican state may open a window to end the US embargo. Cuba implemented some reforms last year to allow people to operate small businesses. It's also loosening controls in state-run firms.

Talks on rescuing Iran's 2015 nuclear deal will carry on for several days before breaking so that Iranian and U.S. officials can return home for consultations, a European Union official said on Friday,

The EU is chairing meetings in Vienna of the remaining parties to the deal - Iran, Russia, China, France, Germany and Britain. A delegation from the United States, which pulled out of the accord under President Donald Trump, is based in a nearby hotel as Iran has refused to hold direct talks.

A second round of talks, which involve discussions in various formats as well as formal meetings of all the remaining parties, started on Thursday. The aim is a U.S. return to the deal, lifting sanctions that were reimposed after its pullout, and undoing Iranian breaches of its nuclear restrictions. read more

Talks will continue ""for a few days and then I think the two most relevant delegations will go back home to receive more precise instructions and then, I don't know when, we will resume,"" the EU official told reporters in a phone briefing.

The talks have been overshadowed by an explosion at Iran's main uranium-enrichment facility at Natanz, which Tehran has blamed on Israel, and Iran's decision to enrich uranium to 60% purity, a big step towards weapons-grade, which it said it started doing on Friday. read more

""We have this (Iranian) decision to go for 60% enrichment. Obviously this is not making the negotiation easier,"" the official said, calling what happened at Natanz ""deliberate sabotage"". It is not clear how long the talks will last in total, he added.

Israel - widely believed to be the only Middle Eastern country with a nuclear arsenal - has not formally commented on the Natanz incident. Several Israeli media outlets have quoted intelligence sources as saying the country's Mossad spy service carried out the operation.

0,U.S. Is Expected to Approve Some Arms Sales to U.A.E. and Saudis,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/us/politics/arms-sales-uae-saudi-arabia.html,"“You can’t cut off everything while your partner is taking daily attacks from an adversary when you’ve made public statements about being committed to their security,” said Kirsten Fontenrose, a director at the Atlantic Council who served as the National Security Council’s director for the Persian Gulf region in the Trump White House.

The review does not recommend suspending any weapons sales to the United Arab Emirates. That fact emerged on Monday, after the Justice Department formally notified lawyers about the decision, which officials say was made this year as part of a lawsuit opposing the agreement brought by the nonprofit New York Center for Foreign Policy Affairs.

The Emirates played a big role in the Yemen war but stepped back recently. As part of negotiations last year to try to persuade the Emirates to normalize relations with Israel, the Trump administration told Emirati officials that it would accelerate approval of sales of F-35 fighter jets and drones.

U.S. officials said on Wednesday that Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken received the report this week from other offices in the State Department, and that he was expected to approve it. The report would then go to the National Security Council for final approval.

“I and many other House members remain concerned about the proposed sale of $23 billion in arms to the U.A.E.,” said Representative Gregory W. Meeks, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He said he had “many questions about any decision by the Biden administration to go forward with the Trump administration’s proposed transfers” of the fighter jets, drones and munitions to the Emirates.

Israeli officials and some members of Congress have expressed concerns that the sales of F-35s would weaken what they called Israel’s “qualitative military edge” over other countries in the region, and that Congress requires presidential administrations to maintain it as a matter of law. Israel is currently the only country in the region with F-35s.

Other U.S. officials have been concerned about selling the F-35, one of the military’s most advanced pieces of hardware, to the United Arab Emirates when it is developing a closer relationship with China, which is notorious for technological espionage. American officials are worried about the radar and stealth abilities of F-35s and some drone technology, among other things.",386,2415,12,64

A new fundraising scheme has been set up to assist with the restoration of Paris's Notre-Dame Cathedral after the 2019 fire, encouraging contributors to ""adopt"" a piece of history at the 12-century Gothic landmark.

The Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris last week launched the website restorenotredame.org, which allows people to sponsor precious artworks, artefacts or even gargoyles that were damaged in the 2019 fire.

The blaze brought down the cathedral's towering spire and roof. The majority of the structure remained intact thanks to the rib vaulting, which saved centuries of priceless heritage central to French culture and history.

Among the precious relics: what is said to be Jesus' crown of thorns and a part of the cross from his crucifixion, as well as the Tunic of St Louis.

The item which had generated most interest and emotion was probably the 14th-century Virgin of the Pillar, which ""attracts the attention of believers because it is the Virgin Mary in all her beauty and significance"", according to Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris president, Michel Picaud.

New mission

The group was first set up in 2017 to raise 110 million euros to repair damage caused by wear and tear and pollution, as well as inferior materials used in the original construction. No major restoration work had been carried out on the monument since the mid-19th century.

The 2019 fire caused an outpouring of international concern – and gave the mission of the Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris even greater urgency. Over 830 million euros has since been donated from more than 150 countries.

Two years on, the repairs are well underway, but lengthy and complex operations remain in order to achieve the ambitious target set by President Emmanuel Macron of restoring the cathedral to its former glory and reopening to the public by April 2024.

The cause of the inferno that transfixed viewers the world over remains uncertain, but investigators have so far rejected any idea of foul play, suggesting a short-circuit or a discarded cigarette could have been to blame.

0,Kataib Hezbollah controls access points to key Iraqi border city,https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2021/04/kataib-hezbollah-controls-access-points-key-iraqi-border-city,"AL-OBEIDI, Iraq — Roughly a dozen young men in black, olive green and camouflage mull around below the arches of the Sheikh Haidar checkpoint between the town of al-Obeidi and the border city of Qaim.

Arches curve over both sides of the checkpoint while a large poster of Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a senior Iraqi security commander from Kataib Hezbollah killed in a US drone strike near Baghdad in January 2020, draws the attention of anyone passing through.

The checkpoint is named after a member of the Shiite-led Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) killed in the war against the Islamic State (IS) in this Sunni-dominant region.

Qaim residents say Kataib Hezbollah and other nonstate armed groups have tightened their grip in the Iraqi-Syrian border area despite measures taken over the past year to reduce the influence of nonstate armed groups across the country.

A Feb. 25 airstrike by the US military on positions held by Kataib Hezbollah and Kataib Sayyid al-Shuhada in the Albu Kamal area of Syria just across the border from Qaim was the first known offensive military action taken by the Joe Biden administration, which took office in late January. The airstrike was carried out in retaliation for rocket attacks on bases hosting international forces.

Kataib Hezbollah claimed that only one of its fighters had been killed in the attack, though other sources and media outlets cited much higher figures. On Feb. 28, Kataib Hezbollah spokesman Mohamed Mohi claimed in a message to this reporter that there had been airstrikes in both Syria and Iraq, but both officials and Qaim residents deny this. Kataib Hezbollah issued a statement claiming the airstrike was an “insult to Iraqi sovereignty.”

Kataib Hezbollah has three brigades within the government-salaried PMU, two of which are deployed in western Anbar. This part of the group officially answers to the central government. However, Kataib Hezbollah as a whole operates outside of Iraqi government control and most analysts say it is linked to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. It is part of the Shiite ""muqawama,"" or Iran-linked ‘resistance’ factions, and was designated a terrorist group by the United States in 2009.

A Washington Institute profile published earlier this month stated, “In practice, KH PMF (PMU) Brigades frequently disobey the GoI (Government of Iraq) chain of command while remaining legally organs of the Iraqi state.”

Several Iran-linked Shiite armed groups have been crossing the Iraqi-Syrian border nearby since the area was retaken from IS in late 2017. Many have been accused of smuggling for profit and not just transporting weapons and men “for the fight against IS,” as is often claimed.

A local security official in Qaim told this reporter on a visit to the district in early April that PMU fighters had gone around the residential areas near the border and demanded to search the call logs of locals’ cellphones after the February airstrike, and that Kataib Hezbollah had set up their own video surveillance network in the city’s markets.

The district of Qaim includes the main city with the town council buildings and hospital, as well as the Husaybah border area, al-Obeidi further east and Roumana, north of the Euphrates River and linked by a bridge now controlled by the PMU.

Local dignitaries who in early 2020 had spoken more openly about the situation to Al-Monitor were in early April wary of speaking about the PMU and other nonstate actors operating in the area.

“It isn’t useful,” Sheikh Sabah, the top sheikh of the Albu Mahal tribe, one of the largest in the area, told Al-Monitor during an interview in al-Obeidi. “We want to speak about what we need. And we need everything. Services. We don’t have enough water, electricity. We need more support for agriculture. Jobs. Everything.”

Next to his relatively simple diwan stands the ruins of his former, palatial home destroyed by al-Qaeda in Iraq in previous years after his tribe rose up against it.

Others close to the top Albu Mahal sheikh say he and many others have land that had previously been used for agriculture south of the main road running from Ramadi to Qaim in an area now “occupied by the PMU.”

“There will be problems with them [PMU] in the future,” many locals say. But, for now, they just want to survive and recover. For that, they say, abiding by the rules of the dominant military forces is essential: in this case, apparently, the PMU.

Abu Aya, a former Qaim Swat commander and current commander of the local tribal PMU Kataib al-Hamza — which was initially formed in the post-2003 years to fight the US 'occupation' but later collaborated with the United States in fighting al-Qaeda and was reformed to fight IS — told Al-Monitor in an April 8 interview that though there were other PMU brigades operating in the area, Kataib Hezbollah was in control and that they were preventing local residents from returning to farm thousands of plots of land south of Qaim “for security reasons.”

During a visit to the Qaim district in early April, Al-Monitor was denied access at the final checkpoint to the city by the nonlocal PMU manning it.

Al-Monitor had authorization from the Joint Operations Command (JOC) to access all of western Anbar for reporting purposes. This reporter had previously made several trips to the area since accompanying the Iraqi army in the operations to retake the area from IS in late 2017, and has accompanied various Iraqi forces on frontlines over the years, including several PMU.

Local sheikhs, security forces and the army all tried unsuccessfully to gain permission for this reporter to cross the checkpoint from the PMU. The response was simply that people “higher up” in the PMU had rejected the request.

Nonlocal PMU including muqawama groups, such as Asaib Ahl al-Haq, took part in the battle for Qaim on the border but not Rawa, which lies further east and north along the Euphrates River. Rawa is not as strategic for controlling the border between Iraq and Syria.

Nonlocal PMU are officially supposed to stay out of Qaim and only guard areas outside of it, Al-Monitor was told by local security forces. They added that this agreement had been reached in previous years after much pressure from the local community and tribes. Nonetheless, many Iran-linked armed groups continue to circulate there, locals say, and now “control all access points.”

Compared with previous visits by Al-Monitor, two more checkpoints for key access points to the city had changed hands from the army to the nonlocal PMU, several local security sources told Al-Monitor.

A Kataib Hezbollah spokesman had not responded by the time of publication to an April 15 request for comment.

In referring to the PMU, a member of the local security forces told Al-Monitor, “They say we are haram and they are halal. That all foreigners — except the Lebanese and Iranians — are enemies. They are the same as IS,” presumably referring to the armed groups’ ""occupation"" of land and religious ""jihad"" being their stated aim for fighting.

“Go on the road they control between here and Akashat and you’ll see what they are like,” he said.

Akashat is south of the city, between Qaim and Rutba, on a road controlled by nonlocal PMU.

“Write that but don’t use my name,” he added. “We have to live here even after you are gone.",1224,7332,10,64

Sue Gough, a spokesperson for the Pentagon, confirmed to CNN that images and footage of a blinking triangular object in the sky, along with other UAPs that were categorized as a “sphere”, “acorn” and “metallic blimp”, were taken by navy personnel in 2019.

Gough told CNN that the defense department would not comment further on the nature of the footage or share any examinations into them.

“To maintain operations security and to avoid disclosing information that may be useful to potential adversaries, DoD does not discuss publicly the details of either the observations or the examinations of reported incursions into our training ranges or designated airspace, including those incursions initially designated as UAP,” Gough said in the statement.

Last April, the Pentagon released three videos of UAPs taken in 2004 and 2015 that included audio of pilots amazed at the speed of the objects they were seeing. “Look at that thing, dude!” one pilot said. “It’s rotating!”

The release of the footage kicked off federal interest in investigating UAPs. In August, the defense department created a UAP taskforce following pressure from congressional lawmakers. In December, Congress passed its government funding bill that included a directive to the national intelligence director and defense secretary to release a report on UAPs in six months’ time.

Last month, Donald Trump’s former intelligence director John Ratcliffe teased the contents of the report, telling Fox News that the document would include unknown sightings from “all over the world”.

“Frankly, there are a lot more sightings than have been made public,” Ratcliffe said.

Per Congress’s spending bill, the UAP report must be published by early June to meet its deadline.",316,2023,10,64

Islamabad, Pakistan – The French embassy in Pakistan has advised all French nationals and companies to temporarily leave the country, after violent protests by a far-right party that has accused French President Emmanuel Macron of committing “blasphemy”.

A French embassy official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the development to Al Jazeera on Thursday.

“I confirm that, due to the situation in Pakistan, we have advised the French citizens and companies to leave the country temporarily,” the official said.

A second French official said that while the embassy in the Pakistani capital Islamabad would remain open, some staff would also be leaving the country.

The AFP news agency, based in France, quoted an email sent to French citizens in Pakistan advising them to leave.

“Due to the serious threats to French interests in Pakistan, French nationals and French companies are advised to temporarily leave the country,” the embassy said in the email, AFP reported.

“The departures will be carried out by existing commercial airlines.”

Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was aware of the French advice “which appears to be based on their own assessment of the situation”.

“For its part, the government is taking enhanced measures for the maintenance of law and order and preventing any damage to life and property,” said Zahid Hafeez Chaudhri, ministry spokesperson.

Anti-France sentiment has been at the centre of the far-right Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) party’s messaging since it held protests last November against comments by Macron that were deemed by many, including Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan, to be “encouraging Islamophobia”.

Those protests were quelled after the TLP reached an agreement with the Pakistani government to put the question of expelling the French ambassador, boycotting all French goods and taking other steps before Parliament.

This week, however, violent protests broke out across the country when the government arrested TLP chief Saad Rizvi in what appeared to be a preemptive move ahead of the expiry of a TLP-issued April 20 deadline for the expulsion of the French envoy.

On Thursday, Pakistan’s government formally banned TLP under anti-terrorism laws, Sheikh Rasheed, the interior minister, told reporters in Islamabad.

Rasheed said the government would also move a legal petition to have TLP officially delisted as a political party by the Election Commission, effectively unseating its two provincial lawmakers in the southern province of Sindh.

TLP emerged as the fourth largest single party in the aggregated national popular vote for the lower house of parliament in the general election in 2018, although its candidates were all beaten. Two TLP members won provincial seats in Sindh in that election.

At least two policemen were killed and hundreds of policemen and protesters were wounded in clashes at the nationwide demonstrations.

Large rallies were held in Karachi, Pakistan’s largest city, the eastern city of Lahore, near the capital Islamabad, and elsewhere.

Major intercity highways and roads were closed for much of Monday and Tuesday as the protests and clashes continued. Police fired water cannon, tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the protesters in some areas.

Furore over cartoons

The November protests followed Macron’s support for the right to republish cartoons depicting Prophet Muhammad, considered “blasphemous” by many Muslims.

The caricatures in question are also viewed by many as Islamophobic, as they often link the faith to “terrorism”.

Blasphemy is a sensitive subject in Pakistan, where insulting Islam’s prophet, holy book or other religious personages are crimes that can carry the death penalty.

Increasingly, blasphemy allegations have led to violence by mobs or targeted attacks, with at least 78 people killed in such violence since 1990, according to an Al Jazeera tally.

In the latest such incident, Taqi Shah, a religious scholar belonging to the minority Shia Muslim sect was axed to death in the town of Jhang in March after being accused of committing “blasphemy”.

Russian authorities demanded earlier this year that DOXA take down its video explaining that students shouldn't be afraid to voice their opinions at a Jan. 23 pro-Navalny protest and that it was unlawful for universities to expel students who attend. DOXA said it had deleted the video at the authorities’ request and maintains that it contained no calls to illegal activity.

Russian police have raided independent student news site DOXA’s Moscow offices and charged its editors with inciting minors to illegally protest, the outlet said Wednesday.

“Today at 6 a.m. [security officers] carried out searches at the DOXA office and the homes of editors Armen Aramyan, Vladimir Metelkin, Alla Gutnikova and Natasha Tyshkevich,” the outlet said on its website.

The four editors were then charged after being taken in for questioning by investigators.

According to human rights lawyer Pavel Chikov, their charges fall under the same case opened against top Navalny aide Leonid Volkov, who was charged in absentia as he is based in Lithuania.

On Wednesday afternoon, dozens of supporters, mostly young people, gathered outside Moscow's Basmanny District Court, where the editors were due to be sentenced to pre-trial restraints.

“I came here to support Natasha [Tyshkevich],” Anna, 26, told The Moscow Times. “I believe the whole case has been fabricated and politically motivated. I also believe that journalistic activities should not succumb to political repressions.”

Leonid, 22, chief editor of the city of Kazan's first independent student-run outlet, said he came to show his support and solidarity with DOXA, who he said set an example for university students nationwide.

“Unfortunately in Russia, everything is arranged so that there are five or six truly independent student publications. There are many of them in general, but very few are willing to criticize the academic community,” he said.

A Moscow court late Wednesday ordered the four journalists to follow restrictions including a ban on phone and internet communications and leaving their homes from 00:00 to 23:59, the Mediazona news website reported. Metelkin called the measures ""essentially house arrest.""

DOXA said in a statement that it will “continue to cover things that are important for young people, and we will continue to stand up for their rights.”

“The pressure that the journalistic community has faced lately is unprecedented, but we will not stop our activities,” the statement said.",408,2606,9,64
0,French MPs pass controversial law that restricts images of police,https://www.euronews.com/2021/04/15/french-mps-pass-controversial-law-that-would-restrict-images-of-police,"French lawmakers have given their final support for a controversial ""global security"" law which has sparked widespread demonstrations.

The bill is centred on ""Article 24"", which will make it an offence to maliciously share images that identify police officers in operation by face or name.

Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said the law would protect police officers from online calls for violence. Police unions have also expressed their support for the measures.

But the legislation has been widely criticised by both humans rights and media organisations who say that it would curtail press freedom and lead to less police accountability.

Thousands of French citizens had demonstrated against the original bill and increased incidents of police violence at nationwide rallies in November.

The rallies prompted the French government to announce a ""complete new rewrite"" of the contested article, which had originally been approved by the country's Senate.

Under Article 24, it will be an offence to disseminate images of national police officers or gendarmes if there is intention or ""provocation"" to identify them.

Any shared videos with malicious intent to identify the spouse, partner, or child of a police or customs officer will also be punished.

Those found guilty could face a sentence of up to five years in prison and a €75,000 fine.

This has been increased from the original legislation, which carried a sentence of one year and a €45,000 fine.

The law states that an offending person must have ""the obvious aim of damaging the physical or psychological integrity"" of the police officer in question.

But the provisions have still faced opposition from NGOs including Reporters without Borders (RSF) and Amnesty International France, who were among those that encouraged people to go to the protests.

""This law sets up a broad surveillance of the French population, including by drones,"" said Anne-Sophie Simpere, advocacy officer for Amnesty International France, referring to another provision of the new law, which allows authorities to use drones to monitor crowds of demonstrators.

""It's a threat to the right to privacy, but also to the right to protest. Many people don't want to be filmed and recorded by the state when they go to a protest, so this will have a deterrent effect on demonstrations,"" Simpere told Euronews.

""The whole logic of the legislation is against human rights law, which is supposed to protect the population against the abusive state and to protect the right to privacy, the right to freedom of expression and the right to inform,"" she said.

'Slippery measure'

Journalists have particularly expressed concern that they are endangered by filming police officers during their work at protests.

Pauline Adès-Mével, editors-in-chief of RSF, told Euronews in December that the “intent to harm” provision was still a “slippery measure”.

""We totally understand what the police is expecting and we do understand that police need to be protected, but the burden is currently on press freedom and journalists,"" she added.

""We need some measures that allow journalists to do their job on the field without being prevented from going live, or to be thought of as having an intention to harm.""

France’s National Consultative Commission on Human Rights has stated that the government has never intended to undermine press freedom with the bill.

Organisers of the demonstrations against the law last year said 500,000 people gathered, while the government estimated there had been 133,000 people present.

Dozens of police officers were injured at the rallies, which took place despite a national lockdown imposed to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The European Union has reminded France that journalists must be able to ""work freely and in full security"", warning that it would examine the country's controversial security bill to ensure it complies with EU laws.

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights office and France’s own human rights ombudsman have also said the new article risks undermining fundamental rights.

The bill was adopted by 75 members of the French National Assembly on Thursday, where President Emmanuel Macron's LREM party has a majority. Just 33 MPs voted against the bill, while 55 abstained.

The law will now have to be approved by France's Constitutional Court before coming into effect.",694,4378,10,65

NEW YORK (Reuters) - More than 500 rape cases have been reported to five clinics in Ethiopia's Tigray region, the United Nations said on Thursday, warning that due to stigma and a lack of health services the actual numbers were likely to be much higher.

""Women say they have been raped by armed actors, they also told stories of gang rape, rape in front of family members and men being forced to rape their own family members under the threat of violence,"" Wafaa Said, deputy U.N. aid coordinator in Ethiopia, said in a briefing to U.N. member states in New York.

She said at least 516 rape cases had been reported by five medical facilities in Mekelle, Adigrat, Wukro, Shire and Axum.

""Given the fact that most health facilities are not functioning and also the stigma associated with rape, it is projected that actual numbers are much higher,"" she added.

A dozen top U.N. officials on Monday called for a stop to indiscriminate and targeted attacks against civilians in Tigray, particularly calling out reports of rape and ""other horrific forms of sexual violence.""

Fighting in Tigray broke out in November between government troops and the region's former ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has also said troops from neighboring Eritrea were in the region.

Redwan Hussein, spokesman for the government's emergency task force on Tigray, Billene Seyoum, spokeswoman for the prime minister, Mulu Nega, head of Tigray's interim administration, Eritrea's Foreign Minister Osman Saleh Mohammed and Eritrea's Information Minister Yemane Gebremeskel did not respond to calls and messages requesting comment on the U.N. remarks on Thursday.

The violence in Tigray has killed thousands of people and forced hundreds of thousands from their homes in the mountainous region of about 5 million.

""Most of the internally displaced people left with nothing more than the clothes they were wearing. They are generally traumatized and tell stories of the difficult journey they took in search of safety. Some reported walking for two weeks and some as far as 500km,"" Said said on Thursday.

""Of the people who traveled with them, some were reportedly killed particularly youngsters, people were reportedly beaten, women were subject to rape, some were pregnant and delivered on the way losing their babies,"" she said.

The United Nations has raised concerns about atrocities, while U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has described acts carried out as ethnic cleansing. Ethiopia rejected Blinken's allegation.

This week, Abiy acknowledged for the first time that atrocities such as rape had been committed and said any soldiers committing crimes would be punished.

Dozens of witnesses in Tigray have told Reuters that Eritrean soldiers routinely killed civilians, gang-raped and tortured women and looted households and crops. Eritrea has not responded to queries on reports of atrocities.

Oklahoma lawmakers have passed a bill that they’re pretending is about protecting citizens when it’s really about their contempt for anti-racism protesters. The legislation that passed in the Republican-controlled Senate on Wednesday increases penalties for protesters who block streets while granting blanket immunity for drivers who injure or even kill protesters. To the GOP legislators in Oklahoma, I say: If you hate Black Lives Matter so much that you want to run it over in your Honda Pilot, just say so.

Anyway, the Associated Press reports that the bill, which is now on its way to be signed by the governor, passed in the state Senate mostly along party lines with a 38-10 vote. The bill makes blocking public streets during a protest a misdemeanor offense punishable by up to a year in jail and a $5,000 fine.



As AP noted: “Blocking roadways is a longtime tactic of nonviolent protesters dating back to even before the civil rights movement in the 1960s.” A protest isn’t really a protest if no one is being disturbed or inconvenienced, but whatever: Let’s just say for the sake of argument that locking up nonviolent protesters for a year for blocking a street is in the interest of public safety and it’s not being done because conservatives view police brutality as negro extermination porn, and they’re mad people are protesting against it.



There’s still the issue of motorists being allowed to plow through demonstrators without suffering consequences.



From AP:



Sen. Rob Standridge, a Republican from Norman who wrote the bill, said it was prompted mostly by an incident in Tulsa last summer in which a pickup truck drove through a crowd gathered on a Tulsa interstate while protesting the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Several people were injured, including one who was paralyzed from the waist down after falling from an overpass, but the driver, whose family was in the car, was not charged. “The kids cowered in the back seat because they feared for their lives,” Standridge said. “That’s what this bill is about.”

So, let me see if I have this right: A driver hit and injured protesters and wasn’t charged with a crime, and in response to that incident, Standridge pushed a bill that ensures no one will ever be charged with a crime for hitting protesters in the future. No, no, that sounds qu-white reasonable.

What about all the ways this bill could go wrong?

What if during a chaotic protest, a participant ends up blocking a street unknowingly or by accident? That’s worth taking their freedom away for up to a year?

What if motorists take this new law to mean that it’s open season on protesters once they get behind the wheel? Last year, we saw report after report after report involving drivers purposely attacking protesters with their vehicles. Once this bill is signed into law, motorists in Oklahoma can go mowing down protesters knowing all they have to do is tell authorities, “I was in fear for my life.”

One would hope that lawmakers in Oklahoma would have the same energy for bills aimed at curbing the police violence and the systemic racism that necessitates these protests in the first place.



More from AP:



Sen. Kevin Matthews, a Democrat from Tulsa and the chairman of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre Centennial Commission, said he was particularly troubled to see legislation targeting protesters but not the underlying issues of police brutality and systemic racism. “In my community, people were bombed from the air, people had cannons shot into our churches, by some accounts 300 people dead and businesses burned down,” Matthews said, referring to the 1921 attack by a white mob on the city’s Black community. “And it was said my people were rioting when it was not true.”

Dalati Nohra/Handout via REUTERS

The United States stands ready to facilitate maritime border talks between Lebanon and Israel that will have benefits for the crisis-hit Lebanese economy, a U.S. envoy said on Thursday.

On a visit to Beirut, Under Secretary of State David Hale blamed Lebanese leaders for failing to end a deadlock in cabinet talks to tackle the collapse, which has crashed the currency. He warned that ""those who continue to obstruct"" progress open themselves up to punitive actions, without naming individuals.

As part of its pressure campaign on Tehran, Washington escalated sanctions last year against Lebanese allies of Hezbollah, hitting former ministers on charges of corruption and ties to the Iran-backed group, which it classifies as terrorist.

Hale accused Hezbollah and Iran of undermining the state after meeting on Thursday with Lebanese President Michel Aoun, a political ally of the group whose son-in-law became a target of U.S. sanctions.

Hale said that talks with Iran on reviving a 2015 nuclear deal could foster regional stability but ""would only be the beginning of our work"" as the United States addresses ""the other elements of Iran's destabilising behavior"".

While pledging not to abandon U.S. interests in Lebanon, Hale said resolving a maritime border dispute with Israel would ""have potential to unlock significant economic benefits for Lebanon"". read more

The two neighbouring enemies launched negotiations last year, a culmination of years of U.S. diplomacy, which have since stalled. The dispute has held up offshore exploration in the eastern Mediterranean. While Israel pumps gas from offshore fields, Lebanon has yet to find commercial reserves.

A statement issued by the Lebanese presidency later said Aoun had asked to accredit international experts to draw border lines according to international law for the area and asked that no oil and gas exploration work be done in the waters in the meantime.

A Lebanese draft decree expanding the country's claims by around 1,400 square kilometers has been approved by the caretaker prime minister and two senior ministers and is awaiting presidential and full cabinet approval. read more

At least one person has been reported killed and several injured after Myanmar security forces opened fire on a pro-democracy protest by medical workers in the city of Mandalay, according to local media on Thursday, with reports of many young demonstrators arrested.

An image posted on social media showed a monk carrying a severely injured man, with two other people assisting him. The person later died, according to a social media post quoting the Mandalay-based Friday Times Journal.

Several photos on social media also showed the military rounding up people on Thursday morning before they could join the protest in the country’s second-largest city.

Medical workers, some of whom have been at the forefront of the campaign against the coup, have gathered early in Mandalay but troops soon arrived to disperse them, opening fire and detaining some people, the Mizzima news agency added.

Mizzima said it did not have details of the number of casualties or arrests.

But among those who were reportedly nabbed by authorities were journalists identified as Ajax and Christopher from Myitkyina News Journal.

Ko Wai Moe Naing, an organiser of anti-military protests in the city of Monywa in Sagaing region was also detained on Thursday, according to the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM).

Images were also posted of several damaged vehicles allegedly destroyed by security forces in Mandalay.

Opponents of the military’s February 1 coup that removed an elected government led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi have kept up their campaign against the military this traditional New Year week with a series of actions and marches.

A spokesman for the military government could not be reached for comment by news agencies.

New Year protest

The coup has plunged Myanmar into crisis after 10 years of tentative steps towards democracy, with daily protests and campaigns of defiance, including strikes by workers in many sectors that have brought the economy to a standstill.

The five-day New Year holiday, known as Thingyan, began on Tuesday but pro-democracy activists cancelled the usual festivities to focus on their opposition to the generals who seized power.

The military says the demonstrations are dwindling but there were reports of flash protests in Sagaing Region as well as in Hpakant township in Kachin State and Kyondoe in Karen State.

In Phayuso township in Kayah State, hundreds of people were seen carrying anti-military government banners, defying warnings by security forces.

Before the latest security crackdown on Thursday in Mandalay, the activist group, Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, had already reported at least 715 protesters killed since the military seized power.

The United Nations human rights office warned on Tuesday that the military clampdown on the protests risked escalating into a civil war, such as Syria’s.

Flagging possible crimes against humanity, the High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet urged countries to take immediate action to push the military to stop its “campaign of repression and slaughter of its people”.

Protesters in Meikhtila held a “Thangyat Strike” on Thursday—the third day of the Thingyan New Year Water Festival.

“I fear the situation in Myanmar is heading towards a full-blown conflict,” Bachelet said in a statement.

“There are clear echoes of Syria in 2011,” she warned, referring to the start of a civil war that over the past 10 years has killed about 400,000 people and forced more than six million to flee the country.

The military government’s bloody crackdown has brought widespread international condemnation and calls for restraint – as well as sanctions from some countries on the Myanmar armed forces and their extensive business interests.

The study was published on the Public Library of Science's website after having been peer-reviewed.

""A unique odor associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection present in human urine as well as saliva, provides impetus for the development of odor-based screening – either by electronic, chemical, or biological sensing methods,"" researchers stated in the study.

However, there is a certain concern for training such dogs, because since the ultimate goal would be for them to detect COVID-positive patients in a public setting and not from such samples, such training would be dangerous, as they would need to be trained around people who have tested positive for coronavirus.

However, researchers expressed concern over the method of providing samples used in training the dogs, as they could possibly get accustomed to specific samples rather than some sort of trademark scent of a COVID-positive sample.

""Future training of dogs and investigation into biological, chemical and electronic detectors should focus on increasing the number of relevant and novel samples,"" the study states.

In February, a German veterinary clinic managed to train sniffer dogs to detect the novel coronavirus in human saliva samples with 94% accuracy. This is not the first study to promote the notion that coronavirus could be detected using medical detection dogs . In fact, the use of sniffer dogs to detect coronavirus in public spaces is considered a potential method for reopening international travel safely.In February, a German veterinary clinic managed to train sniffer dogs to detect the novel coronavirus in human saliva samples with 94% accuracy.

“We did a study where we had dogs sniffing samples from COVID-positive patients and we can say they have a 94% probability in our study... that they can sniff them out,” said Holger Volk, head of the veterinary clinic.

“So dogs can really sniff out people with infections and without infections, as well as asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID patients,” he added.

In Finland, dogs trained to detect the novel coronavirus began sniffing passenger samples at Finland’s Helsinki-Vantaa Airport last September, in a pilot project alongside more usual testing there.

Chile’s international airport in Santiago is also using canine detectors.

A study published in March found that Thai sniffer dogs trained to detect COVID-19 in human sweat proved nearly 95% accurate during training and could be used to identify coronavirus infections at busy transport hubs within seconds.

“The dogs take only one to two seconds to detect the virus,” Professor Kaywalee Chatdarong, leader of the project at the veterinary faculty of Thailand’s Chulalongkorn University, told Reuters.

“Within a minute, they will manage to go through 60 samples.”

The dogs can detect a volatile organic compound secreted in the sweat of COVID-19 sufferers, even in the absence of disease symptoms, the Thai researcher said.

NEW DELHI: An alarming spike in COVID-19 cases has created a crisis across India, particularly in the capital, New Delhi, recording more than 25,000 cases — about one in three of those tested — in the past 24 hours, according to official data.

The situation in New Delhi, which has a population of more than 20 million people, forced Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to write to the federal government seeking more hospital beds. Several health care facilities have said they can no longer accommodate patients, leading to a rise in fatalities due to lack of space, oxygen cylinders and drugs.

“The situation in Delhi is very grim,” Kejriwal wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

He asked the PM to “earmark 7,000 beds out of 10,000 in the federal government-run hospitals in Delhi” for COVID-19 patients to “tide over the crisis.”

“There is an acute dearth of oxygen in Delhi, and it should be supplied immediately,” Kejriwal added.

On Sunday, India registered a record single-day rise of 261,500 coronavirus infections taking the nationwide case total to almost 1.48 million.

More than 1,500 people died from the coronavirus disease on Sunday alone, another record for the nation of 1.39 billion, bringing the national toll to 177,168 deaths.

Several residents in New Delhi said that most private and government hospitals had run out of beds with many patients desperate to get admitted to hospital.

“Since yesterday evening I have been trying to admit my sister in a hospital but seven or eight hospitals I reached refused admission,” Tabish Jamal, a Delhi resident, told Arab News on Sunday.

“My sister’s oxygen level is dipping, and she needs immediate medical intervention, but it’s a grim scenario. We are so helpless,” she said, adding that “a small nursing home with basic facilities” had admitted her sister, but “we are getting desperate.”

Lucknow, the capital of the eastern state of Uttar Pradesh, is also facing a bleak scenario with media reports saying that people were “waiting in hordes to be admitted to hospitals,” with at least 50 seen queueing outside the King George’s Medical University, the city’s main facility.

“It’s a grim scenario in the city and around Lucknow,” Kulsum Mustafa, a senior journalist in Lucknow, said on Sunday.

She accused the government of “hiding the exact figures and not showing the true picture.”

“The fact is that there is not only an acute shortage of beds and oxygen, but the testing facilities are minimal too,” Mustafa said.

India’s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh reported close to 27,550 cases on Sunday making it the second-worst affected area, after the western state of Maharashtra, which had registered more than 67,000 patients in the past 24 hours.

Meanwhile, in the western state of Gujarat, which is PM Modi’s home state, officials reported scenes of “chaos at most hospitals” in the capital city of Ahmedabad.

“Ahmedabad city, like other places in India, is facing a shortage of oxygen, hospital beds and important medicines such as Remdesivir,” Dr. Mona Desai, chief of Ahmedabad Medical Association, said on Sunday.

“With the new variant of coronavirus, the oxygen level starts to dip very soon, and the state is not prepared to supply oxygen to all. The timely intervention of oxygen is important; otherwise, vital organs fail,” she added.

On Sunday, Gujarat registered nearly 10,000 cases, which Desai said is “not the real figure.”

“The death toll is high this time, but the government data is not showing that. I don’t know why they hide the data.”

Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said that the “oxygen production is being doubled.”

“Oxygen production is being diverted from industrial to medical use. The center is providing additional ventilators to the states,” he told a press conference on Sunday.

He said that Maharashtra, with Mumbai as its capital, would get 1,121 ventilators, Uttar Pradesh 1,700, Jharkhand 1,500, Gujarat 1,600, Madhya Pradesh 152 and Chhattisgarh 230.

Experts and medical practitioners, however, questioned the “sincerity of the government” in fighting the pandemic.”

“It’s more than one year, and the government is not ready to face the challenges posed by a coronavirus,” Mustafa said, adding before questioning the “rationale of allowing the Hindu festival Kumbh to take place in this year.”

The Kumbh Mela is a month-long festival that takes place once every 12 years, with organizers expecting a footfall of 150 million Hindus — equivalent to the population of Russia — to converge on the northern state of Uttarakhand for a ritual dip in holy waters at four dedicated sites this year.

So far, 5 million people have visited the sacred sites since the festival began on April 1.",783,4788,9,65

A new assessment in the medical journal Lancet has found ""consistent, strong evidence"" that the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, is predominantly transmitted through the air.

Therefore, public health measures that fail to treat the virus as predominantly airborne leave people unprotected and allow the virus to spread, according to six experts from the UK, USA and Canada, including Jose-Luis Jimenez, a chemist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) and the University of Colorado Boulder.

""The evidence supporting airborne transmission is overwhelming, and evidence supporting large droplet transmission is almost non-existent,"" Jimenez said. ""It is urgent that the World Health Organization and other public health agencies adapt their description of transmission to the scientific evidence so that the focus of mitigation is put on reducing airborne transmission.""

The team of experts, led by the University of Oxford's Trish Greenhalgh, reviewed published research and identified 10 lines of evidence to support the predominance of the airborne route.

At the top of their list: Super-spreader events such as the Skagit Choir outbreak, in which 53 people became infected from a single infected case. Studies have confirmed these events cannot be adequately explained by close contact or touching shared surfaces or objects.

Moreover, transmission rates of SARS-CoV-2 are much higher indoors than outdoors, and transmission is greatly reduced by indoor ventilation.

The team highlighted research estimating that silent (asymptomatic or presymptomatic) transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from people who are not coughing or sneezing accounts for at least 40 per cent of all transmission. This silent transmission is a key way COVID-19 has spread around the world, ""supporting a predominantly airborne mode of transmission,"" according to the assessment. The researchers also cited work demonstrating long-range transmission of the virus between people in adjacent rooms in hotels; people who were never in each other's presence.

By contrast, the team found little to no evidence that the virus spreads easily via large droplets, which fall quickly through the air and contaminate surfaces.

""We were able to identify and interpret highly complex and specialist papers on the dynamics of fluid flows and the isolation of live virus,"" lead author Greenhalgh said. ""While some individual papers were assessed as weak, overall the evidence base for airborne transmission is extensive and robust. There should be no further delay in implementing measures around the world to protect against such transmission.""

The new work has serious implications for public health measures designed to mitigate the pandemic. First, ""droplet measures"" such as handwashing and surface cleaning, while not unimportant, should be given less emphasis than airborne measures, which deal with inhalation of infectious particles suspended in the air.

If an infectious virus is primarily airborne, someone can potentially be infected when they inhale aerosols produced when an infected person exhales, speaks, shouts, sings, or sneezes. So airborne control measures include ventilation, air filtration, reducing crowding and the amount of time people spend indoors, wearing masks whenever indoors (even if not within 6 feet or 2 meters of others), attention to mask quality and fit, and higher-grade PPE for healthcare and other staff when working in contact with potentially infectious people.

""It is quite surprising that anyone is still questioning whether the airborne transmission is the predominant transmission pathway for this virus or not,"" said co-author Professor Kimberly Prather, an aerosol scientist from the University of California San Diego. ""Only by including inhalation of aerosols at both close and long range can we explain the many indoor outbreaks that have occurred around the globe. Once we acknowledge this virus is airborne, we know how to fix it. There are many examples of places that have fared much better by acknowledging this virus is airborne from the start. The world needs to follow their lead as soon as possible.""",641,4262,8,65
0,Philippines seizes fossilized giant clam shells worth $25 million,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/17/asia/fossilized-clam-shells-seized-intl-scli/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_latest+%28RSS%3A+CNN+-+Most+Recent%29,"(CNN) The Philippines is shell-ebrating after it seized more than 150 tons of fossilized giant clams Friday worth nearly $25 million.

As part of a joint operation, the Philippine coast guard found the shells, known locally as ""taklobo"", on the shores of Sitio Green Island, in the western Palawan province, it said in a Facebook post. The haul was worth ₱1.2 billion (around $24.8 million).

It is the biggest illegal giant clam shell haul in the region, according to the coast guard's Palawan commander, Commodore Genito Basilio.

The law enforcement team arrested four suspects, accusing them of violating the Philippine Wildlife Resources Conservation and Protection Act . Article 27 of the Act says it's unlawful for someone to ""willfully and knowingly exploit wildlife resources and their habitats"" for a number of reasons, including trading the wildlife or for the purposes of collection.

Anyone who kills or destroys wildlife species categorized as threatened could face two years in prison or a fine of ₱20,000 ($410), according to the Act.

The Palawan Council for Sustainable Development (PCSD), which also took part in the operation alongside intelligence groups such as the Australian Federal Police, said in a statement Saturday it questioned a member of the group taking the clams, Rosalee Tequillo.

""PCSDS' [sic] discussion with Dra. Tequillo resulted in learning that she and her group are engaged in the collection and possession of Giant Clam species for commercial purposes without legal authority,"" the statement said.

Tequillo claimed she had permission from the Philippine president's office and the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) to collect the shells, said the PCSD, adding that Tequillo had no documents to prove this.

President Rodrigo Duterte's office, the BFAR and the PCSD did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

""A certain group of individuals"" was spreading the false rumor that the PCSD and the BFAR were allowing the collection of taklobo, said the PCSD in a statement on April 13.

The giant clams help maintain marine wildlife by sheltering some animals and stopping too much algae growth, according to CNN affiliate CNN Philippines

Tequillo also asserted the suspected group had a ""treasure hunting permit,"" but the giant clams are not covered by this, according to the PCSD. The mollusks can only be collected for taxonomic purposes and not for commerce, it added.

Teodoro Jose S. Matta, the PCSD's executive director, emphasized in Saturday's statement that the body, which is responsible for regulating the Wildlife Act in Palawan, would ""remain firm in the commitment to clamp down on illegal wildlife trading.""

In a separate statement released on Saturday the PCSD called on local fishers and citizens to abstain from collecting and commercially trading the shells and other threatened wildlife.

This seizure is one of a number of similar incidences in recent months. Alongside the Philippine coast guard and other groups, the PCSD seized 324 pieces of giant clam shells worth ₱160 million on Johnson Island on March 3, following a similar discovery in October.",498,3143,9,65

The Dogecoin (CCC:DOGE-USD) cryptocurrency is getting traction from high-profile investors. Back in February, it was actually more of a rounding error, as it was trading for $0.002.

Source: Orpheus FX / Shutterstock.com

But as the crypto craze got into gear, Dogecoin would quickly go on to hit a high of $0.082605 before crashing and bouncing even higher. It’s trading this morning at somewhere around $0.14.

The origins of Dogecoin go back to 2013. The founders included Billy Markus, who was a software engineer at IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Jackson Palmer, who was a developer at Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE).

“The cryptocurrency DogeCoin gained popularity in 2013, after its creators created a satire about the proliferation of dubious crypto coins during that same year,” said James Page, who is a technical writer and executive for Cryptohead. “It is said to be started as a joke, because it was inspired from a viral meme ‘Doge.’”

But of course, Dogecoin is now pretty serious. So why is this the case? And what are the prospects for this digital currency?

Well, let’s take a look.

A Backgrounder

The two founders of Dogecoin have since left the project. However, they did create a thriving community on Reddit which has allowed for strong growth.

An example of the power of this is when the Dogewallet was hacked in the early days.

“Normally, this would be a bad PR day for any cryptocurrency or firm,” said Richard Gardner, who is the CEO of Modulus. “In this case, however, the community came together to compensate the victims, and a tragic event brought users even closer together. It is the sense of community that makes DOGE coin, parody or not, really quite unique among the altcoins market.”

Keep in mind that Dogecoin is used primarily for smaller transactions, say for tipping people. “I think it’s because of this usability that demand naturally increased over time,” said Morgan Taylor, who is the CEO of Sourcery.

The Dodgecoin platform is based on open source and has a robust technology core.

“Today it has some serious benefits like super-fast transactions that you can send to anyone anywhere in the world for less than a penny in fees,” said Ben Weiss, who is the CEO of CoinFlip. “Dogecoin was never designed to hold much intrinsic value. Unlike Bitcoin, there is no cap on how many dogecoins will be minted.”

Now one of the biggest recent catalysts for Dogecoin has been Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Elon Musk. He tweeted the following: “Dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency. It’s pretty cool.”

But of course, there are also a myriad of other influencers that are fans of Dogecoin. One is billionaire Mark Cuban, who has announced that his NBA team – the Dallas Mavericks – will accept the currency for the payment of tickets and merchandise.

Where Now?

As should be no surprise, there are many price targets for Dogecoin. And some are quite bullish. For example, Coinpedia predicts that it will hit $1 by the end of this year. The same goes for the European Review.

This may be a stretch. But then again, if there continues to be more adoption and a few more tweets from Musk, Dogecoin could certainly see more gains. There is also buzz that Coinbase may put this digital currency on its platform. If so, this would represent a nice source of demand.

Yet there is the nagging problem that Dogecoin can be easily created. This is in contrast to Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), which has a relatively fixed supply. Because of this, a shortage can dramatically increase the value of this digital currency.

In other words, it’s a good idea to be cautious Dogecoin. The crypto market can be quite volatile and it is not necessarily clear which digital coins will ultimately prevail.

Russia's media watchdog Roskomnadzor has filed at least 390 violation cases against RFE/RL since October and is expected to announce more on Friday.

The broadcaster is asking the ECHR to order Russia to refrain from enforcing the fines until the court can make a full ruling on Roskomnadzor's moves.

""We are hopeful that the European Court of Human Rights will view these actions by the government of Russia for what they are: an attempt to suppress free speech and the human rights of the Russian people,"" RFE/RL president Jamie Fly said in a statement.

RFE/RL said the fines could reach millions of dollars.

Why is Russia imposing fines on media outlets?

Last year, Roskomnadzor ordered broadcasters and non-governmental organizations that receive foreign funding to add a lengthy disclaimer to their content specifying that it was created by an outlet ""performing the functions of a foreign agent.""

The decision has been widely criticized as a tool to discredit critical reporting, with the term ""foreign agent"" carrying Soviet-era connotations in Russia.

RFE/RL's said Russia’s moves violate the European Convention on Human Rights.

Last week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken raised concerns over Russia's ""efforts to close Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and silence this valued source of independent reporting.""

The standoff comes as Washington's ties with Moscow are strained by several issues. On Thursday, the US expelled Russian officials and sanctioned Russian individuals and entities for election interference.

The US and the European Union have also slammed the Kremlin over the conflict in eastern Ukraine and for jailing Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny.

0,"Officials say Tokyo Olympic cancellation, no fans still an option",https://www.tsn.ca/officials-say-tokyo-olympic-cancellation-no-fans-still-an-option-1.1624190,"TOKYO — Two officials in Japan's ruling LDP party said Thursday that changes could be coming to the Tokyo Olympics. One suggested they still could be cancelled, and the other said even if they proceed, it might be without any fans.

Toshihiro Nikai, the No. 2 and secretary general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, mentioned the cancellation only a day after Tokyo reached the 100-days-to-go mark on Wednesday.

He made his comments in a show recorded by Japan's TBS TV.

""If it seems impossible to go on with the games, they must be definitely cancelled,"" Nikai said. ""If there is a surge in infections because of the Olympics, there will be no meaning to having the Olympics.""

Asked if a cancellation was still an option, Nikai said: ""Of course.""

But he also added: ""It is important for Japan to have a successful Olympics. It is a big opportunity. I want to make it a success. We will have many issues to resolve and prepare, and it is important to take care of them one by one.""

Prime Minister Toshihide Suga said in a statement there was ""no change to the government position to do everything to achieve safe and secure Olympics.""

The Canadian Olympic Committee said in a statement that it remains confident that the Games will be staged safely and successfully, ""and (we) look forward to participating at Tokyo 2020.

""Not only because of what we know is being planned by the IOC and Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee to safeguard health and safety but because of our own decisions being made. Our actions will continue to be guided by our Chief Medical Officer and Canadian public health officials.""

Canada led the way a year ago when both the Canadian Olympic and Paralympic Committees announced they wouldn't send teams to Tokyo unless the Games were postponed. Two days later, the IOC announced the Games would be pushed back a year.

Tokyo organizers said they, the IOC and the International Paralympic Committee ""are fully focused on hosting the games this summer."" They said Suga ""has repeatedly expressed the government's commitment"" to holding the Olympics.

COVID-19 cases have been rising across Japan. On Thursday, Japan's second-largest metropolitan area of Osaka recorded 1,208 new cases. It was the third straight day that new cases surpassed 1,000. Tokyo hit 729, its highest total in more than two months. Japan has attributed 9,500 death to COVID-19, good by world standards but poor by results in Asia.

Tokyo and Osaka have been under an alert status since earlier this month, but officials are concerned there is little sense of urgency. Experts on a Tokyo metropolitan government taskforce warned that the new variant could replace the conventional virus and trigger explosive infections by early May. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike urged residents to take maximum protection and asked non-Tokyo residents not to visit the area.

Taro Kono, the government minister in charge of Japan's vaccine rollout, said even if the Olympics go on, there may be no fans of any kind in the venues. He said it's likely that the Olympics will have to be held in empty venues, particularly as cases surge across the country.

That means only television cameras and still cameras will be around to record the action, joined by some reporters, judges and match officials.

The delayed Tokyo Olympics are to open in just over three months on July 23, and the Paralympics follow on Aug. 24. Fans from abroad have already been banned. Now even Japanese spectators could be kept away.

""I think the question is how to do the Olympics in a way that is possible in this situation,"" Kono said Thursday on a television talk show. ""That may mean there will probably be no spectators.""

Kono did not suggest the Olympics would not go ahead, but he said they could be held under only ""certain conditions.""

“The way these Olympics will be held will be very different from past ones,” he said.

Tokyo organizers have said they expect to announce a decision this month on the number of fans allowed into each venue.

Organizers had expected to receive about US$800 million from ticket sales, their third-largest source of income. Any shortfall will have to be made up by Japanese government entities, which are already footing most of the bills.

The official cost for the Olympics is $15.4 billion, but several government audits have suggested it might be twice that much, and all but $6.7 billion is public money.

The rockets targeted Balad airbase north of Balad, and two crashed into a dormitory and a canteen of US company Sallyport, the source tells AFP.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the United States routinely blames Iran-linked Iraqi factions for such attacks on its troops and diplomats.

It was not immediately clear if there were any casualties.

F-16 aircraft are stationed at the Balad airbase north of Baghdad, and several maintenance companies are present there, employing Iraqi and foreign staff.

The speaker of the Iranian parliament announced on Friday that the nation had succeeded in its plans for uranium enrichment.

""I proudly announce that Iranian scientists ... have managed to produce uranium enriched to 60 percent"", speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf wrote on Twitter.

At the same time, the head of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, Ali Akbar Salehi, confirmed that the operation is ""underway at the Martyr Ahmadi Roshan nuclear facility"" in Natanz.

Iran managed to boost its programme using IR-4 and IR-6 centrifuges, which are much faster than its first-generation IR-1 centrifuges, allowed by the 2015 nuclear deal.

Tehran's intentions, previously announced by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) sparked international concerns, with the EU calling the Iranian plans ""extremely worrisome from a nuclear non-proliferation perspective"".

International nuclear organisations consider uranium to be weapons-grade if it is enriched to a level of 20 percent or more., while 90 percent is needed for the production of nuclear weapons.

Iran started suspending its obligations set in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2019, precisely one year after the United States pulled out of the agreement and reimposed economic sanctions against the Middle Eastern country.

Last December, Tehran passed a law to boost its uranium enrichment and stop IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities in response to the killing of nuclear physicist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, which the Iranians blamed on Israel.

The United States said they are ready to overturn Trump's withdrawal from the JCPOA but need Iran to stop violating the deal first, while the Islamic republic stressed that Washington has to suspend the unilateral sanctions before any talks are possible.",339,2208,10,65

The Czech Republic has announced that it is expelling 18 Russian diplomats identified as spies over a huge ammunition depot explosion in 2014.

Prime Minister Andrej Babis said on Saturday the Czech intelligence agencies had provided evidence about the involvement of Russian military agents in the massive explosion that killed two people. He said the Czech Republic, as a sovereign state, had to react to those findings.

“There is well-grounded suspicion about the involvement of officers of the Russian intelligence service GRU, unit 29155, in the explosion of ammunitions depot in the Vrbetice area,” Babis said.

Interior Minister Jan Hamacek, who is also serving as the foreign minister, said the Russian embassy staffers were clearly identified as Russian military spies.

“Eighteen employees of the Russian embassy must leave our republic within 48 hours,” Hamacek told reporters.

In Russia, the Interfax news agency cited Vladimir Dzhabarov, first deputy head of the upper house’s international affairs committee, as saying Prague’s claims that Russian intelligence officers were involved in the explosion were absurd.

Moscow’s response to the expulsion of 18 diplomats should be proportionate, Dzhabarov said on Saturday.

Several explosions shook the Vrbetice ammunition depot, 330km (205 miles) southeast of the capital, Prague, on October 16, 2014.

The explosions killed employees of a private company that was renting the depot from a state military organisation.

Separately on Saturday, Czech police said they were searching for two men carrying various passports, including Russian ones in the names of Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov.

Those names were the aliases used by two Russian military intelligence officers who British prosecutors charged with the attempted murder on British soil of Russian spy Sergei Skripal. They and Moscow both denied involvement.

Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were poisoned with a nerve agent in the English city of Salisbury in March 2018. The attack prompted the biggest wave of diplomatic expulsions between Moscow and the West since the Cold War.",336,2213,9,65

The European Union must pressure Moscow to allow Alexei Navalny to have access to his doctor, allies of the hunger-striking Kremlin critic wrote in a letter sent this week to EU foreign ministers.

Navalny, 44, a prominent opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin, announced a hunger strike at the end of March in protest at what he said was the refusal of prison authorities to treat him properly for acute back and leg pain.

Two allies of Navalny, Vladimir Ashurkov and Leonid Volkov, wrote to the 27 EU ministers to urge them to discuss Navalny's health at their next meeting on Monday, according to a copy of the letter seen by Reuters.

""Alexei must immediately be granted his lawful request for a doctor of his choice,"" said the letter, which was also sent to the parliaments of EU member states.

The letter raised similar health concerns to those voiced on Tuesday by Navalny's wife, who said after visiting him in prison that he was having difficulty speaking and had lost more weight.

""Alexei's health is steadily deteriorating,"" the letter said, citing an unofficial copy of test results that showed spinal problems.

""He now feels numbness not only in his both legs, but also in his left hand, along with pain in his back and muscular impairment,"" the letter said.

""Alexei is also suffering from a fever and a heavy cough. Several inmates in his penal colony unit have recently been diagnosed with tuberculosis,"" it added.

Navalny, who the West says has been wrongly jailed and should be freed, returned to Russia in January after recovering from what German doctors say was a nerve agent poisoning.

He was jailed in February for two and a half years for parole violations that he called politically motivated. Russia has said it has yet to see evidence he was poisoned.

Staff at the Russian prison said they have offered Navalny proper treatment, but that he refused it. read more

Russia’s prisons service said on Tuesday that a panel of doctors assessed Navalny’s health as satisfactory and that he was transferred from the clinic back to the main part of the prison on April 9, the RIA news agency quoted it as saying.

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly

Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and U.S. President Joe Biden will highlight Tokyo's central role in Washington's strategy to counter the challenge of an increasingly assertive China at a summit on Friday.

While that emphasis on Japan's key status will be welcome in Tokyo, where some politicians are pushing for a tougher stance towards Beijing, it also raises questions about how far Tokyo can go to meet demands on regional defence and human rights.

""This will be the precursor to a series of meetings among like-minded countries to send the right signal to Beijing,"" Kunihiko Miyake, an adviser to Suga, told Reuters.

Suga took over as premier last September, inheriting a China policy that sought to balance security concerns with deep economic ties.

But striking that balance has become harder as China increases maritime activities in the East and South China Seas and near Taiwan, which Beijing considers a wayward province.

Rights concerns have deepened over the treatment of Muslim Uighurs in China's Xinjiang region. China denies abuses, but Washingtonsays Beijing is perpetrating a genocide.

Suga will be the first foreign leader to meet Biden in person since the president took office, something that could give Suga a boost ahead of a general election this year.

""Asking Suga to meet the president first means a lot - that China competition is critical and who is the best partner? Japan,"" said Toshihiro Nakayama of Japan's Keio University.

""That also means that Japan has to do more.""

Suga told reporters before leaving for Washington he hoped to strengthen the alliance based on the shared values of freedom, democracy, human rights and rule of law, show the two countries' leadership in creating a ""free and open Indo-Pacific"" and build a relationship of trust with Biden.

Besides regional security, the two are also expected to discuss climate change, supply chain resilience, a global semiconductor shortage and COVID-19.

Marc Knapper, the senior official for Japan and Korea at the U.S. State Department, said issues that would be ""front and centre"" in the discussions included ""China's unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the East China Sea, South China Sea; what's happening within China, and...around China, Taiwan, Hong Kong.""

He told an event at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies there would also be discussion of North Korea's nuclear missile program, which threatens both Japan and the United States, and ways to address ""existential issues of our time, climate change, clean energy, COVID-19.""

Japan is grappling with rising coronavirus infections with fewer than 100 days from the planned start of the Summer Olympics in Tokyo. read more

'PEACE AND STABILITY'

In a statement after a March meeting of U.S.-Japan defence and foreign ministers, the two sides ""underscored the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait"" and shared ""serious concerns"" about human rights in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.

The United States, the European Union, Britain and Canada have imposed sanctions on Chinese officials for alleged abuses in Xinjiang and some Japanese lawmakers think Tokyo should adopt its own law allowing it to do the same, while Japanese executives worry about a backlash.

Japanese officials were divided over whether Suga should endorse a strong statement on Taiwan, despite U.S. urging, or Xinjiang, two Japanese ruling party lawmakers familiar with the discussions said.

A Japanese foreign ministry official said it was not decided whether there would be a joint statement after the summit.

Asked to comment, a senior U.S. official said: ""We would not want Japan to make any statements that they do not fully support.""

Any comments by Suga on either Taiwan or human rights will be closely watched by China, which has warned Tokyo against ""being misled"" by countries biased against Beijing.

Taiwan is China's most sensitive territorial issue and a source of major friction with Washington, which is required by U.S. law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.

While Tokyo has no official diplomatic relations with Taipei, non-governmental engagement has flourished. Some Japanese lawmakers want even closer ties.

The last time U.S and Japanese leaders referred to Taiwan in a joint statement was in 1969, when Japan's prime minister said maintenance of peace and security in the ""Taiwan area"" was important for its own security. That was before Tokyo normalised ties with Beijing.

Japan hosts over 50,000 U.S. military personnel and, experts say, would be unlikely to stand idly by in any Taiwan crisis, although many ordinary citizens would probably be wary of entanglement.

0,Birmingham launches taskforce as babies die at twice national rate,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/apr/18/birmingham-launches-taskforce-as-babies-die-at-twice-national-rate,"A taskforce is being set up to tackle baby deaths in Birmingham, after a report revealed infant mortality rates in the city are nearly twice the national average, with families from Pakistani backgrounds disproportionately affected.

Councillors described the situation as “distressing” and said the report made for uncomfortable reading after it highlighted deprivation, ethnicity and health inequalities as key factors in the stubbornly high numbers, which equate to more than 100 babies dying before their first birthday in the city every year.

“Something is going wrong. We need to act to put it right,” said the councillor Rob Pocock, the chair of the health and social care scrutiny committee, which produced the report. “This is a tragedy that can and must be reduced.”

The infant mortality rate in Birmingham is seven deaths per 1,000 live births, compared with 3.9 deaths in England as a whole, and numbers have not declined in recent years as they have done nationally.

Death rates are highest in the areas of the city with the worst deprivation, a key issue in Birmingham where 28.1% of children live in low-income families compared with 17% nationally.

On Tuesday, councillors voted in favour of establishing a new multi-agency taskforce with the goal of reducing infant mortality in the city by at least 50% by 2025, and working with community groups and faith leaders to help minimise risk factors.

The report said data from Birmingham’s 2011 census showed Pakistani, black African and Afro-Caribbean populations were overrepresented in child deaths, and analysis from the city’s Child Death Overview Panel highlighted Pakistani families as being particularly affected.

Nationally, stillbirth and neonatal mortality rates (death within 28 days of birth) are 60% higher for babies of Asian and Asian British ethnicity compared with babies of white ethnicity, and 45% higher for babies of black or black British ethnicity.

This equates to one in 188 Asian or Asian British babies being stillborn compared with one in every 295 babies of white ethnicity.

“Really, more work does need to be done to understand why there is such a significant and frankly unacceptable variation among different communities,” said Josie Anderson, the policy, research and campaigns manager at Bliss, the leading UK charity for babies born premature or sick.

“Research has shown women living in the most deprived areas had an 80% higher risk of stillbirth and neonatal deaths compared to women living in the least deprived areas. And of course there is quite a lot of intersection between women living in deprived areas and also ethnicity as well.” She advocated the use of continuity of care practices where women are treated by either the same midwife or a very small group of midwives throughout their pregnancy to boost trust and communication.

The report said a fifth of infant deaths in Birmingham were caused by abnormalities at birth, the risk of which is doubled by consanguineous marriage (marriage between couples related as second cousins or closer), a study has shown. Pocock said the report “sought not to exaggerate this issue but we have also not ignored it. It is part and parcel of the range of complex factors that we face in attempting to deal with the problems of infant mortality.”

The report said the challenge in tackling the potential risk of consanguinity was “complicated by cultural sensitivities and misconceptions […] as well as inadequate knowledge and skills among healthcare professionals and low levels of trust among communities that have past experience of discrimination”.

Shabana Qureshi, the wellbeing manager at Ashiana Community Project in Sparkbrook, an inner-city area with the second-highest non-white population in Birmingham, was one of the contributors to the report. “In terms of the scientific rationale as to why intermarriage is such a risk, I think there’s some awareness but it’s limited,” she said.

“There is awareness that when you marry a closer relative, there is a higher risk that your child may have some complications surrounding its birth. But I think that’s often dismissed because the communities we are working with are predominantly of Pakistani origin and in Pakistan 50% or more of the population practice consanguinity. It’s something that’s quite normalised.”

She said “consistent and culturally sensitive” messaging was crucial to improving genetic literacy in the community, but stressed that child poverty was still the main factor that needed addressing. “Across all of the ethnic groups, including Pakistani, Bangladeshi and black communities, you’re more likely to experience higher levels of perinatal death or stillbirth due to socioeconomic deprivation,” she said.

“We need to address that blatant inequality so a baby born in a particular area to a person of a particular ethnicity has just as much a chance of survival as a baby being born in an affluent area.”",788,4947,10,66
0,Cuba's Raul Castro is stepping down as head of its Communist Party,https://us.yahoo.com/news/cubas-raul-castro-stepping-down-143526775.html,"Raul Castro is stepping down as the head of the Communist Party of Cuba, the most powerful position on the island, with few expectations of significant change among Cubans.

It is however, a historic move — Castro and his late brother, Fidel Castro, have been in power since the 1959 revolution.

The Communist Party’s eighth congress will begin Friday when it will certify President Miguel Díaz-Canel as the next party secretary-general and set policy guidelines. Raul Castro had said in 2018 he expected Díaz-Canel to replace him after his retirement in 2021. Díaz-Canel, 60, represents a new generation and is serving the first of two five-year terms as president.

Many analysts believe Castro, who turns 90 in June, will continue to be the most influential figure on the island until his death.

In Cuba, major events are put together during historic celebrations and this year’s congress is no exception. It coincides with the 60th anniversary of the failed, CIA-backed Bay of Pigs invasion.

Castro’s retirement comes as Cuba, one of the last communist run-countries in the world, is facing multiple challenges. Its economy shrank 11 percent in 2020 due to the pandemic, and it's been grappling with tightened U.S. sanctions and a decline in aid from its ally, Venezuela. The government lacks hard currency to import food and medicine, which means endless lines outside stores when food becomes available, and one meal a day for some families.

The country is also dealing with a spike in Covid-19 cases. Strict lockdowns and measures have kept the numbers of cases and deaths below those of most countries in the region, but they have also tested the patience of many Cubans. Cuba has developed five vaccine candidates and two are in late-stage trials.

The country’s challenges have led to public discontent at levels rarely seen since the 1959 communist revolution. Mobile internet has allowed videos of protests to quickly spread among Cubans and also helped activists mobilize. A large protest in November by artists demanding greater freedom of expression made headlines across the globe.

Story continues

President Joe Biden campaigned on reversing some of the previous administration’s harsh measures, such as limits on remittances and restricted travel to the island by Americans while focusing on human rights. But so far, administration officials have indicated they won’t be making changes anytime soon. Juan Gonzalez, executive director of the National Security Council, said recently that the “political moment” has changed from the Obama administration years and that “oppression against Cubans is worse today than perhaps during the Bush years.”

Disenchantment in the island over the country’s centrally planned system, stagnant economy and decaying infrastructure has been brewing for years, especially among younger Cubans. During the Communist Party’s congress in 2011, a set of ambitious economic reforms were promised that have not been fully implemented.

Victoria Hernández 37, an entrepreneur who sells products such as hangers and batteries in East Havana, says she does not expect much from the congress.

“I think our officials should change their mentality more to improve things. Right now what we’re thinking about is food. I want to also think about having a car, a better house,” she said.

Need for economic reform

But some experts believe Castro's move is important in order to speed up economic reforms. This involves strategic decisions in order to keep the public more content without ceding the tight grip the party has over society.

Arturo López-Levy, a professor at Holy Names University in California, thinks the economic reforms will gain traction once the pandemic is under control.

“What is happening now is a new generation is consolidating control,” he said. “Now they will be forced to make important reforms, because their legitimacy doesn't come from a revolutionary background, but from being capable of showing better performance.”

He said there aren’t high expectations among Cubans because the country “will remain a Leninist system and that basically means the political monopoly of the Communist Party.”

Fabio Fernández, a history professor at the University of Havana, often quoted in the Communist Party newspaper Granma, says it’s important for the party to move forward, fulfill the economic reforms it promised over a decade ago, and make political changes without abandoning its socialist system.

“A new concept of Cuban socialism is what we need to adopt because the old one no longer works,” he said.

REUTERS/Ari Jalal

A drone dropped explosives near U.S. forces stationed at Erbil airport in northern Iraq late on Wednesday, Kurdish officials said, with no immediate reports of casualties.

A separate rocket attack killed a Turkish soldier at a military base nearby, the Turkish defence ministry said.

It was the first known attack carried out by an unmanned aerial drone against U.S. forces in Erbil, amid a steady stream of rocket attacks on bases hosting U.S. forces and the embassy in Baghdad that Washington blames on Iran-backed militias.

The interior ministry of the autonomous Kurdistan regional government, based in Erbil, said in a statement the drone was carrying TNT which it used to target the U.S. forces. It said no one was hurt in the attack.

A group that Western and some Iraqi officials say is aligned with Iran praised the attack, but did not explicitly claim it.

A barrage of rockets hit the same U.S.-led military base in the Erbil International Airport vicinity in February, killing a non-American contractor working with the U.S. military.

Shortly before Wednesday's attack in Erbil, at least two rockets landed on and near a base to the west of the city that hosts Turkish forces, Iraqi security officials said. That attack killed a Turkish soldier, Ankara said.

A rocket hit a base belonging to an Iraqi Shi'ite Muslim militia group near that Turkish base a few hours later, a security official said, wounding at least one fighter. It was not immediately clear who had fired the rocket.

Turkey also has troops in Iraq both as part of a NATO contingent and a force that has attacked Kurdish separatist militants in the north.

The Iran-backed militias oppose both the presence of the United States and Turkey and demand a full withdrawal of all foreign troops.

The United States has sometimes responded with air strikes against Iran-aligned militias including on the Iraqi-Syrian border.

An air strike ordered by former president Donald Trump that killed Iran's top commander Qassem Soleimani in January 2020 sent the region to the brink of a full-scale conflict.

The Associated Press reported that Jonathan Pentland, 42, was detained in the Richland County jail in South Carolina on Wednesday.

In the video that was originally posted to Facebook on Monday, Pentland can be seen walking close behind a Black man. When asked what he is doing in the neighborhood, the Black man says he is ""walking,"" and Pentland responds, ""Let's go. Walk away.""

""You’re in the wrong neighborhood,"" Pentland can be heard saying in the video. ""I ain’t playing with you. ... I’m about to show you what I can do.""

Pentland demands to know where the other man lives and accuses him of ""harassing the neighborhood."" When the Black man responds to a woman Pentland identifies as his wife, Pentland shoves him.

Walking while black.



The kind of hate that our black skin attracts is absolutely ridiculous. There are so many #jonathanpentland’s in positions of power who abuse their authority and engage in white supremacy activities, just like this.

As the AP reported, the woman who originally posted the video, Shirell Johnson, said that when authorities arrived on the scene, Pentland was given a citation for malicious injury to property for slapping the other man's phone out his hand.

Social media accounts have connected Pentland to Fort Jackson in South Carolina, where he has been reportedly stationed since 2019, working as a drill sergeant at the garrison.

In a statement on Twitter, Fort Jackson Commander Brig. Gen. Milford Beagle Jr. said, ""The leaders at Fort Jackson in no way condone the behavior depicted in the video posted recently.""

Fort Jackson stated that the Department of Justice is looking into the incident and confirmed that Pentland has been charged.

""This action deeply impacts our community--the neighbors in the Summit, the city of Columbia, Richland & Lexington counties, and our Army family,"" Beagle said. — Fort Jackson (@fortjackson) April 14, 2021

Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott did not disclose the other man's identity during a news conference, the AP reported, but confirmed that he is not a juvenile. He stated that the man had been involved in other incidents in the neighborhood before the video but said that “none of them justified the assault that occurred.”

Videos on social media appeared to show protesters demonstrating outside Pentland's house. The gathered crowd chanted, ""We will make racist people uncomfortable.""

(Bloomberg) -- China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd.’s expansive pop-up showroom sits at the heart of Shanghai’s National Exhibition and Convention Center. With nine models on display, it’s hard to miss. The electric car upstart has one of the biggest booths at China’s 2021 Auto Show, which starts Monday, opposite storied German automaker BMW AG. Yet its bold presence belies an uncomfortable truth -- Evergrande hasn’t sold a single car under its own brand.China’s largest property developer has an array of investments outside of real estate, from soccer clubs to retirement villages. But it’s the recent entry into electric cars that’s captured investors’ imaginations. Shareholders have pushed Evergrande NEV’s Hong Kong-listed stock up more than 1,000% over the past 12 months, allowing it to raise billions of dollars in fresh capital. It now has a market value of $87 billion, greater than Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co.Such exuberance over an automaker that has repeatedly pushed back forecasts for when it will mass produce a car is emblematic of the froth that has been building in EVs over the past year, with investors plowing money into a rally that briefly made Elon Musk the world’s richest person and has some concerned about a bubble. Perhaps nowhere is that more evident than in China, home to the world’s biggest market for new energy cars, where a mind-boggling 400 EV manufacturers now jostle for consumers’ attention, led by a cabal of startups valued more than established auto players but which have yet to turn a profit.Evergrande NEV was a relatively late entrant to that scene.In March 2019, Hui Ka Yan, Evergrande’s chairman and one of China’s richest men, vowed to take on Musk and become the world’s biggest maker of EVs in three to five years. Tesla Inc.’s Model Y crossover had just had its global debut. In the two years since, Tesla has gained an enviable foothold in China, establishing its first factory outside the U.S. and delivering around 35,500 cars in March. Chinese rival Nio Inc. earlier this month reached a significant milestone when its 100,000th EV rolled off the production line, prompting Musk to tweet his congratulations.Despite his lofty ambitions and Evergrande NEV’s rich valuation, Hui has repeatedly pushed back car-production targets. The tycoon’s coterie of rich friends, among others, have stumped up billions, but making cars -- electric or otherwise -- is hard, and hugely capital intensive. Nio’s gross margins only flipped into positive territory in mid-2020, after years of heavy losses and a lifeline from a municipal government.Speaking on an earnings call in late March after Evergrande NEV’s full-year loss for 2020 widened by a yawning 67%, Hui said the company planned to begin trial production at the end of this year, delayed from an original timeline of last September. Deliveries aren’t expected to start until some time in 2022. Expectations for annual production capacity of 500,000 to 1 million EVs by March 2022 were also pushed back until 2025. Still, the company issued a buoyant new forecast: 5 million cars a year by 2035. For comparison, global giant Volkswagen AG delivered 3.85 million units in China in 2020.It’s not just Evergrande’s delayed production schedule that’s raising eyebrows. A closer look under the company’s hood reveals practices that have industry veterans scratching their heads: from making selling apartments part of car executives’ KPIs, to attempting a model lineup that would be ambitious for even the most established automaker.‘Weird Company’“It’s a weird company,” said Bill Russo, the founder and chief executive officer of advisory firm Automobility Ltd. in Shanghai. “They’ve poured a lot of money in that hasn’t really returned anything, plus they’re entering an industry in which they have very limited understanding. And I’m not sure they’ve got the technological edge of Nio or Xpeng,” he said, referring to the New York-listed Chinese EV makers already deploying intelligent features in their cars, like laser-based navigation.A closer look at Evergrande NEV’s operations reveals the extent of its unorthodox approach. While it’s established three production bases -- in Guangzhou, Tianjin in China’s north, and Shanghai -- the company doesn’t have a general car assembly line up and running. Equipment and machinery is still being adjusted, according to people who have seen inside the factories but don’t want to be identified discussing confidential matters.In a response to questions from Bloomberg, Evergrande NEV said it was preparing machinery for trial production, and would be able to make “one car a minute” once full production is reached.The company is targeting mass production and delivery next year of four models -- the Hengchi 5 and 6; the luxe Hengchi 1 (which will go up against Tesla’s Model S); and the Hengchi 3, according to people familiar with the matter. The company has told investors it aims to deliver 100,000 cars in 2022, one of the people said, roughly the number of units Nio, Xpeng Inc. and Li Auto Inc., the other U.S.-listed Chinese EV contender, delivered last year, combined.Its workers are also being asked to help sell real estate, the backbone of the Evergrande empire.New hires are required to undergo internal training and attend seminars that drill them on the company’s property history and have nothing to do with car making. In addition, employees from all departments, from production-line workers to back-office staff, are encouraged to promote the sale of apartments, whether through posting ads on social media or bringing relatives and friends along to sale centers to make them appear busy. Managerial-level staff even have their performance bonuses tied to such endeavors, people familiar with the measure said.Meanwhile, the ambitious targets have Evergrande NEV turning to outsourcing and skipping procedures seen as normal practice in the industry, people with knowledge of the situation say.While it’s hiring aggressively and recently scored Daniel Kirchert, a former BMW executive who co-founded EV startup Byton Ltd., the firm has contracted most of the design and R&D of its cars to overseas suppliers, some of the people said. Contracting out the majority of design and engineering work is an unusual approach for a company wanting to achieve such scale.14 Models At OnceOne of those companies is Canada’s Magna International Inc., which is leading the development of the Hengchi 1 and 3, one of the people said. Evergrande NEV has also teamed with Chinese tech giants Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Baidu Inc. to co-develop a software system for the Hengchi range. It will allow drivers to use a mobile app to instruct the car to drive via autopilot to a certain location and use artificial intelligence to switch on appliances at home while on the road, according to a statement last month.A spokesperson for Evergrande said it was working with international partners including Magna, EDAG Engineering Group AG and Austrian parts maker AVL List GmbH in developing “14 models simultaneously.” Representatives from Magna declined to comment. A Baidu spokesperson said the company had no further details to share, while a representative for Tencent said the software venture is with a related firm called Beijing Tinnove Technology Co. that operates independently. Tinnove didn’t respond to requests for comment.Rather than staggering model releases, Evergrande NEV appears to be rolling out every type of car all at once under its Hengchi brand, which sports a roaring gold lion on the badge and translates loosely to ‘unstoppable gallop.’ The nine models being launched span almost all major passenger vehicle segments from sedans to SUVS and multi-purpose vehicles. Prices will range from about 80,000 yuan ($12,000) to 600,000 yuan, although the final costs could change, a person familiar said.That’s a completely different product development strategy to EV pioneers like Tesla, which only has four models on offer. Nio and Xpeng have also chosen to focus on just a handful of marques, and even then are struggling to break into the black.“The market has proved the effectiveness of the ‘one product in vogue at one time’ strategy,” said Zhang Xiang, an automobile industry researcher at the North China University of Technology. “Evergrande is offering many products and expects a win. There’s a question mark over whether this will work.”Without any long-term carmaking nous, Evergrande has issued uncompromising directives to meet its latest production targets, according to the people. Two models, including the Hengchi 5, a compact SUV that rivals Xpeng’s G3, are targeting mass production in a little over 20 months. To hit that timing, certain industry procedures, like making mule cars, or testbed vehicles equipped with prototype components that require evaluation, may be skipped, people familiar with the situation said. Evergrande told Bloomberg it has entered a “sprint stage toward mass production.”As it is, Bloomberg could only find one instance where the Hengchi 5 has been showcased in public, in photos and grainy footage released by Evergrande in February as the cars drove around a snow-covered field in Inner Mongolia. The company’s shares surged to a record.Glossing over those steps is unusual, said Zhong Shi, a former automotive project manager turned independent analyst.“There’s a standard engineering process of product development, validation and verification, which includes several laboratory and road tests” in China and everywhere else, Zhong said. “It’s hard to compress that to shorter than three years.”While there’s no suggestion Evergrande’s approach violates any regulations, its stock-market run could be in for a reality check. After similarly hefty market gains, some EV startups in the U.S. that have yet to prove their viability as revenue-generating, profitable entities have lost their shine over the past few months amid concern about valuations and as established carmakers like VW move faster into EV fray.Read more: The End of Tesla’s Dominance May Be Closer Than It AppearsThe industry’s multi-billion dollar surge also hasn’t escaped Beijing’s attention. Evergrande NEV shares dipped lower last month after an editorial from the state-run Xinhua news agency highlighted concerns about how the EV sector is evolving. Of particular worry are companies that are shirking their responsibility to build quality cars, a blind race by local governments to attract EV projects, and high valuations by companies that have yet to deliver a single mass-produced car, according to the missive, which named Evergrande specifically in that regard. “The huge gap between production capacity and market value shows there is hype in the NEV market,” it said.Still, Evergrande NEV’s stock has gained 18% since then, buoyed by the outlook for China’s electric-car market. EVs currently account for about 5% of China’s annual car sales, BloombergNEF data show, with demand forecast to soar as the market matures and electric-car prices fall. EV sales in China may climb more than 50% this year alone, research firm Canalys said in a February report.With competition also on the rise, some outside Evergrande NEV’s loyal shareholder base remain skeptical.“The market is getting crowded but unless you have a preferred lane, there’s not much chance to win,” Automobility’s Russo said. “Maybe there’s some synergy with the property businesses but right now it’s an EV story, and a pretty expensive one.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",1844,11696,15,66

Sexual violence is being used as a weapon of war in Ethiopia's Tigray, the U.N. aid chief told the Security Council on Thursday, prompting the U.S. envoy to challenge the body's silence, asking: ""Do African lives not matter as much as those experiencing conflict in other countries?""

The U.N. official, Mark Lowcock, said the humanitarian crisis in Tigray had deteriorated over the past month with challenges to aid access and people dying of hunger. He said the world body had not seen any proof that soldiers from neighboring Eritrea - accused of massacres and killings in Tigray - have withdrawn.

""To be very clear: the conflict is not over and things are not improving,"" Lowcock said, according to his notes for the private briefing, which was requested by the United States.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield noted Thursday's briefing was the fifth private council meeting since fighting between Ethiopia's federal government troops and Tigray's former ruling party began in November, according to diplomats familiar with her remarks.

""The Security Council has been unified on Syria, Yemen and even on Burma, where we were able to come together to release a statement,"" she said, according to the diplomats. ""We are asking the council to reconsider a statement on Ethiopia. ... Victims need to know the Security Council cares about this conflict.""

The council has so far been unable to agree on a public statement on Tigray, with Western countries pitted against Russia and China, which diplomats say question whether the body - charged with maintaining international peace and security - should be involved in the crisis.

The conflict has killed thousands of people and forced hundreds of thousands more from their homes in the mountainous region of about 5 million. Eritrea has been helping Ethiopian troops, although Eritrea has repeatedly denied its forces are in Tigray.

Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has acknowledged the Eritrean presence and the United Nations and the United States have demanded that Eritrean troops withdraw from Tigray.

""Neither the U.N. nor any of the humanitarian agencies we work with have seen proof of Eritrean withdrawal,"" Lowcock said.

GIRLS AS YOUNG AS 8 TARGETED

Lowcock said he had received a report earlier on Thursday that 150 people had died from hunger in Tigray and warned that ""starvation as a weapon of war is a violation.""

Dr. Fasika Amdeselassie, the top public health official for the government-appointed interim administration in Tigray, told Reuters that at least 829 cases of sexual assault had been reported at five hospitals since the conflict began. read more

""There is no doubt that sexual violence is being used in this conflict as a weapon of war,"" Lowcock said, adding the majority of rapes were committed by men in uniform, with accusations made against all the warring parties.

""Nearly a quarter of reports received by one agency involve gang rape, with multiple men assaulting the victim; in some cases, women have been repeatedly raped over a period of days. Girls as young as eight are being targeted,"" Lowcock said.

Ethiopia's U.N. ambassador, Taye Atskeselassie Amde, told Reuters the government was investigating all rights violations. He accused Lowcock of ""behaving not like a humanitarian but a nemesis determined to exact some kind of retribution.""

""Human rights violations are too serious and grave to be subjected to speculations. It is unfortunate the head of OCHA (the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) resorted to such an act before the U.N. Security Council,"" he said, adding that ""there is no gap in humanitarian access.""

Eritrea's U.N. mission in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Lowcock's remarks. Last month, Eritrean Information Minister Yemane Gebremeskel said that sexual violence and rape ""are an abomination to Eritrean society"" and should be harshly punished if they occurred.

0,Philippines raises carbon emission reduction target to 75% by 2030,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/philippines-raises-carbon-emission-reduction-target-to-75-per-cent-by-2030,"MANILA (REUTERS) - The Philippines said on Friday (April 16) it was revising its target to cut greenhouse gas emissions to a 75 per cent reduction by 2030 under its commitment to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, up from a target of 70 per cent set four years ago.

Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III, who also chairs the country's Climate Change Commission, described the new target as ""ambitious"", though some environmental activists called on the government to do more.

Breaking down the target, 72.29 per cent is conditional on the support of climate finance, technologies and capacity development provided by developed countries, as prescribed by the Paris Agreement.

The accord, which came into force in 2016, aims to transform the world's fossil-fuel-driven economy within decades and slow the pace of a global temperature increase to well below 2 deg C.

The Philippines ratified the agreement in 2017, allowing Manila access to the Green Climate Fund, which aims to channel billions of dollars to help poor nations tackle global warming.

The remaining 2.71 per cent of the target should be implemented mainly through domestic resources, the Department of Finance said in a statement.

Under a ""business-as-usual"" scenario, the government estimates that the South-east Asian country's overall emissions during the 2020-2030 period will be 3,340.3 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e).

Greenpeace, however, called on the government to do more and for the Department of Energy to speed up the country's energy transition.

""Following the administration's pronouncements to fast track renewable energy and for a moratorium on new coal proposals, the energy department should be doing much more to put their words into action,"" the environmental organisation said in a statement.",281,1811,10,66

He got out and tried to dislodge the truck, but it tumbled down the embankment onto the railway track.

Neither Mr. Lee nor Mr. Hua attempted to alert authorities to the situation, the prosecutors said.

Just over one minute later, the Taroko Express, which was packed with 498 people, including many families who were on their way to scenic eastern Taiwan for the Tomb Sweeping holiday weekend, emerged from a nearby tunnel and collided with the vehicle. The train had been traveling at about 80 miles an hour, investigators have said.

The prosecutors said they were bringing multiple charges against Mr. Lee, including negligent homicide, leaving the crash scene and falsifying his credentials to apply for the project.

If convicted on all counts, Mr. Lee could face up to twelve years in prison, Ms. Chou said in an interview.

Mr. Hua and two other project supervisors who were not at the crash site that day have also been charged with negligent homicide, a crime which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison. The police department had previously said that Mr. Hua was a migrant worker from Vietnam.

The revelation that the crane truck had been associated with a government-commissioned project has triggered an increasingly heated public discussion in recent days about the Taiwan Railways Administration, which runs the Taroko Express and was also the agency behind the slope safety scheme.",261,1560,10,66

“India has stood firm on the northern borders, and we have proven that we will not get pushed. In whatever we have been able to achieve in standing firm, in preventing a change of status quo, we have been able to gather world support,” CDS Rawat while speaking at the Raisina Dialogue series.

Rawat said that China feels that “they have arrived, they have a superior armed force, because of the tech advances that they have”. China, he said, has been “able to create disruptive technologies which can paralyse systems of the adversary” which is why, “they feel just by doing a little bit of shove and push, they will be able to compel nations to give in to their demands”.

“They have tried to ensure that they can change the status quo by the use of disruptive technology, without using force. As of now they have not used force. They thought that India as a nation will succumb to the pressures that they are putting on us, because of the tech advances that they have.” Rawat said.

But the “international community” has come to India’s support to say, he said, “that yes there is an international rules-based order, which every nation must follow”. That, Rawat said, “is what we have been able to achieve, and that is what we are trying to gather support from the other international nations”.

He said globally the situation is changing and “geopolitics coupled with the geo-economics is indeed seeking to reshape the rules that govern the world order”. There are some nations, he said, that follow the international order while others depend on their own law, “they make their own rules and regulations, try and change the status quo”.

“These kinds of things do lead to conflict situation, and that is what we are witnessing on our northern borders,” he said.

Changes in geopolitics are “shaped by a nation-first approach” as “today nations feel that we need to authoritatively pressurise other nations if they can, and that is what is leading to a changing security situation” Rawat stated.

He said soon adversaries “may get embroiled into conflict, with one of the other nations even being unaware, that they are actually in conflict”.

“Nations are trying to become assertive. And this is what, I think, China attempted to say that it is my way or no other way. But I think, such nature of undeclared war, will place dilemma in the minds of decision-makers, whether or not to resort to kinetic force, and thus be labelled as an aggressor.”

“While militaries around the world are seeking innovative systems to enhance their combat capabilities, disruptive tech on the other hand will compel nations to rethink their concept doctrines and techniques of warfighting,” he added.

He expressed satisfaction at international cooperation, saying that “We are very satisfied in the way the international community is coming together to coordinate their efforts to ensure that authoritarian regimes do not have their way around, and that everybody follows the rules-based international order”.

Talking about the exit of US and NATO forces from Afghanistan, Rawat said that India has “concerns about Afghanistan” and would “like to see peace and tranquillity returning to that region”.

If exit of the US and NATO forces will lead to peace, “we would be happy to see such a situation emerging”, he said. “But our concern is that the vacuum that is going to be created with the withdrawal of US and NATO, should not create space for other disruptors to step in, therefore the violence continues in Afghanistan.”

He said India will be “very happy to provide whatever support we can in the development of Afghanistan, and making sure that ultimately peace returns to that nation,” adding that “there are many nations that are willing to step into Afghanistan”.",673,3978,12,66

Picture taken April 14, 2021. REUTERS/Bernadett Szabo

The cross on top of Hungary's largest church, the magnificent Esztergom Cathedral, has been hiding a 176-year-old time capsule that was only recovered during renovation work this year.

The sealed copper canister was inside the cross on the 100-metre dome, the highest in Hungary, which survived being bombed during World War Two.

The container was also badly damaged by shrapnel but when they opened it, historians discovered documents in near-perfect condition relating to the cathedral's construction.

Csaba Torok, director of the Cathedral's Treasury, said the papers gave a rare glimpse of the time when the church was built from 1822 onwards.

The cylindrical capsule was placed in the cross in 1845 by Archbishop Jozsef Kopacsy and chief architect Jozsef Hild, who took over after his predecessor was murdered.

""Archbishop Kopacsy knew he would not be able to complete the construction in his lifetime, so when the cross was finished he wanted to leave inside an imprint of the memory of the builders and of that era,"" Torok said.

The best moment was when they found the documents: one depicting milestones in the construction and a book containing names of clergymen and parishes.

""These were last touched by human hands when they were placed there 176 years ago, so somehow we felt a sudden connection in time,"" he said.

""Unfortunately, we did not find any coins from the period in the capsule so there was nothing to help pay for the renovation,"" he added, smiling.

The Catholic cathedral was built on Castle Hill, where a church was first founded over a 1,000 years ago. Its iron dome was built in Vienna and carried in sections down the Danube on barges.

For its consecration in 1856, Hungarian composer and pianist Franz Liszt composed a mass. But the cathedral was still not finished, with the main portico and interior only completed later in the 19th century.

A new time capsule might be placed in the cross for future generations. But its copper cover will be sealed on June 30, so they will have to move quickly, Torok said.

0,Whitest paint ever created could have air-con like cooling effects,https://newatlas.com/materials/whitest-paint-ever-air-con-cooling-effects/,"The materials we coat our buildings with can have a big influence on their ability to reflect heat from the Sun and overall energy efficiency. Engineers at Purdue University have been at the cutting edge of this field of research for some time, and have just produced the whitest paint ever created, which they say reflects 98.1 percent of sunlight and can produce cooling effects that are on par with common air conditioners.

Upping the performance of white paints so that they reflect higher amounts of solar radiation is a common goal among researchers looking to keep living spaces cooler and lessen our reliance on air conditioners and other energy-intensive cooling systems. One NASA study from 2021 found that white coatings on New York City rooftops could reduce their peak temperatures by an average of 43 °F (24 °C), for example. We've also seen scientists cook up highly reflective paints made from glass, and others that incorporate Teflon to reflect up to 98 percent of incoming radiation.

The Purdue University scientists had recently shown off an ultra-white paint capable of reflecting 95.5 percent of sunlight. This material already far exceeds commercially available heat-reflecting paints that bounce away 80 to 90 percent of sunlight, but now the researchers are upping their game even further.

Their new ultra-white paint owes its excellent performance to a careful mix of particles made from barium sulfate, which is a chemical compound used in white photographic paper and cosmetics. These particles can make the paint very white and very reflective, but there is a line to be drawn in terms of compromising its performance, with too high a concentration causing the paint to peel off or break apart.

But by varying the size of the particles, the scientists can alter each one's ability to scatter light, with a wider range of particle sizes resulting in a paint that can scatter more of the light spectrum coming from the Sun. The team has now landed on just right recipe to produce the whitest paint ever made, and therefore the coolest paint on record.

“A high concentration of particles that are also different sizes gives the paint the broadest spectral scattering, which contributes to the highest reflectance,” says Joseph Peoples, a Purdue Ph.D. student in mechanical engineering.

An infrared camera image demonstrates how a sample of the whitest white paint can cool a board or surface below ambient temperature Purdue University/Joseph Peoples

The paint was put to the test outdoors where it was found to keep surfaces 19 °F (10.5 °C) cooler than their ambient surroundings at night time, and 8 °F (4.5 °C) cooler under strong sunlight during the middle of the day. In one outdoor test during the middle of winter in ambient temperatures of 43 °F (6.1 °C), the paint lowered the temperature of a surface by 18 °F (10 °C).

“If you were to use this paint to cover a roof area of about 1,000 square feet (93 sq m), we estimate that you could get a cooling power of 10 kilowatts,"" says Xiulin Ruan, a Purdue professor of mechanical engineering. ""That’s more powerful than the central air conditioners used by most houses.""

The research was published in the journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.

0,US war on Afghanistan cost $2.26 trillion and still rising: Report,https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2021/04/18/649714/US-war-cost-Afghanistan-new-report-Brown-University-,"America’s nearly 20-year military occupation of Afghanistan has cost the country $2.26 trillion, a new study finds, further insisting that the costs will continue to accumulate even after the US total withdrawal from the war-ravaged country later this year, as pledged by Washington.

In its Costs of War report released Friday, Brown University’s Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs has tallied the astounding expense of the longest US war, as the administration of new US President Joe Biden vows to pull out the last few thousand American troops from Afghanistan no later than September 11.

The latest cost analysis of the US war collected estimated congressional appropriations for the military engagement, including operations in both Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan.

According to the report, the greatest single expense -- $933 billion, or 41 percent of the war's total costs -- came in the US Defense Department's Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) spending.

The controversial OCO budget, which was used to pay for the military invasion, was unaffected by budgetary caps imposed on the rest of the department of defense (DoD) and grew significantly over the years.

It further notes, however, that the DoD's base budget also saw its own war-related increases -- apart from the OCO budget and the costs of actually waging war in Afghanistan – underlining that the US military's overall budget grew by an additional $443 billion, making it the third-largest expense of the war effort.

The report also reveals that the war’s second-largest cost was accrued interest expenses -- totaling $530 billion -- from borrowing funds to pay for the military engagement.

Pointing out that the US has also spent $296 billion for the medical treatment of veterans returning from the Afghanistan war, the study insists that such costs are not yet done accumulating, explaining that its analysis did not include the costs of lifetime care for war veterans or future interest payments on the money Washington has borrowed for the war.

According to the study, the US State Department's own OCO war budget cost $59 billion.

The report further estimates that up to 241,000 people have so far died in Afghanistan and Pakistan as a direct result of the war, including 2,442 American troops, six DoD civilians, 3,936 US contractors, and 1,144 allied troops.

The war also took the lives of between 66,000 and 69,000 Afghan national military members and police, as well as another 9,314 Pakistani troops and police forces, it added.

The study also estimates that more than 71,000 civilians -- roughly 47,000 in Afghanistan and 24,000 in Pakistan – were killed, along with over 51,000 opposition fighters in Afghanistan and nearly 33,000 more in Pakistan.

It further pointed out that nearly 136 journalists and media workers, and 549 humanitarian workers, also died in the US-led war.

The US military began the massive invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 in the name of “international war on terrorism,” vowing to overthrow the al-Qaeda-linked Taliban government -- which were heavily backed and funded by close US allies, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan – and root out terrorism across the impoverished country.

0,France passes ‘historic’ law that sets age of sexual consent at 15,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/france-sex-age-consent-15-b1832457.html,"France has passed a “historic law” with a landmark vote in parliament to define sex with a child under the age of 15 as rape and prohibited sex with relatives aged under the age of 18.

On Thursday, the parliament voted unanimously to make rape with children below 15 a punishable offence, inviting up to 20 years in jail.

The long stand-law comes after the country was rocked by series of sex abuse scandals for years and allegations of incestuous abuse plagued the French elite.

“This is an historic law for our children and our society,” justice minister Éric Dupond-Moretti said in the National Assembly on Thursday.

The activists and supporters believe that the new law will make it easy to prosecute predators and serial offenders.

“No adult aggressor will be able to claim the consent of a minor younger than 15 years old,” Mr Dupond-Moretti said.

Previous laws allowed consent of a person to be accepted by the court irrespective of the age, that included adults having sex with children or making incest relations.

Although the sex between adults and under-5s was prohibited but allowed consent of under 15s, making it extremely difficult for the prosecutors to prove allegations of child rape.

However, a so-called ""Romeo and Juliet"" clause was added to the law which still makes it possible for teenagers to consent to sex with a minor, who is above five years of age. The clause will not apply to cases of sexual assault.

This clause was added after concerns were raised by lawmakers that setting the age of consent at 15 will automatically criminalise a sexual relationship between young partners of the same age.

The legislation has also toughened laws on incestuous sex as thousands of women who were the victim of the sexual crimes testified they were abused by their relatives.

The country that has long cherished its image as the land of seduction and romance was marred by exposé of sex scandals after the #MeToo swept across France after step daughter of prominent academic Olivier Duhamel was accused of abusing her twin brother as a child.

It led to more people coming forward to testify with the hashtag #MeTooIncest.

Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/15/world/africa/ethiopia-eritrea-tigray.html,"NAIROBI, Kenya — Eritrean troops continue to commit atrocities in the northern Ethiopian region of Tigray, despite assurances by Ethiopia’s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, that they were leaving, a senior United Nations official said Thursday.

Mr. Abiy has come under pressure over reports of massacres, looting and sexual assaults by Eritrean troops. Last month, he flew to the Eritrean capital, Asmara, and announced that his ally, the autocratic Eritrean leader Isaias Afwerki, had agreed to bring his soldiers home.

But the U.N. and its humanitarian partners have seen no evidence that such a withdrawal has taken place, Mark Lowcock, the top U.N. humanitarian official, told the Security Council. In fact, Mr. Lowcock said, Eritrean soldiers had begun to disguise their identities by wearing Ethiopian military uniforms, and some had killed civilians during indiscriminate attacks as recently as Monday.

The Times obtained a transcript of Mr. Lowcock’s remarks, which were made in a private briefing.

REUTERS/Shamil Zhumatov

Moscow expelled 20 Czech diplomats on Sunday in a confrontation over Czech allegations that two Russian spies accused of a nerve agent poisoning in Britain in 2018 were behind an earlier explosion at a Czech ammunition depot that killed two people.

Prague had on Saturday ordered out 18 Russian diplomats, prompting Russia to vow on Sunday to ""force the authors of this provocation to fully understand their responsibility for destroying the foundation of normal ties between our countries"".

Moscow gave the Czech diplomats just a day to leave, while Prague had given the Russians 72 hours.

The Czech Republic said it had informed NATO and European Union allies that it suspected Russia of causing the 2014 blast, and European Union foreign ministers were set to discuss the matter at their meeting on Monday.

The U.S. State Department commended Prague's firm response to ""Russia's subversive actions on Czech soil"". read more

The row is the biggest between Prague and Moscow since the end of decades of Soviet domination of eastern Europe in 1989.

It also adds to growing tensions between Russia and the West in general, raised in part by Russia's military build-up on its Western borders and in Crimea, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014, after a surge in fighting between government and pro-Russian forces in Ukraine's east.

Russia said Prague's accusations were absurd as it had previously blamed the blast at Vrbetice, 300 km (210 miles) east of the capital, on the depot's owners.

It called the expulsions ""the continuation of a series of anti-Russian actions undertaken by the Czech Republic in recent years"", accusing Prague of ""striving to please the United States against the backdrop of recent U.S. sanctions against Russia"".

ARMS SHIPMENT

Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said the attack had been aimed at a shipment to a Bulgarian arms trader.

""This was an attack on ammunition that had already been paid for and was being stored for a Bulgarian arms trader,"" he said on Czech Television.

He said the arms trader, whom he did not name, had later been the target of an attempted murder.

Bulgarian prosecutors charged three Russian men in 2020 with an attempt to kill arms trader Emilian Gebrev, who was identified by Czech media as the same individual. Reuters was unable to reach Gebrev for comment.

Czech police said two men using the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov had travelled to the Czech Republic days before the arms depot blast.

Those names were the aliases used by the two Russian GRU military intelligence officers wanted by Britain for the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok in the English city of Salisbury in 2018. The Skripals survived, but a member of the public died.

The Kremlin denied involvement in that incident, and the attackers remain at large. read more

Czech interior and acting foreign minister Jan Hamacek said police knew about the two people from the beginning, ""but only found out when the Salisbury attack happened that they are members of the GRU, that Unit 29155"".

Hamacek said Prague would ask Moscow for assistance in questioning them, but did not expect it to cooperate.

""DANGEROUS AND MALIGN""

British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab tweeted that the Czechs ""have exposed the lengths that the GRU will go to in their attempts to conduct dangerous and malign operations"".

A NATO official said the alliance would support the Czech Republic as it investigated Russia's ""malign activities"", which were part of a pattern of ""dangerous behaviour"".

""Those responsible must be brought to justice,"" added the official, who declined to be named.

The United States imposed sanctions against Russia on Thursday for interfering in last year's U.S. election, cyber hacking, bullying Ukraine and other actions, prompting Moscow to retaliate.

On Sunday, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Washington had told Moscow ""there will be consequences"" if Alexei Navalny, the opposition figurehead who almost died last year after being given a toxin that Western experts say was Novichok, dies in prison, where he is on hunger strike. read more

The 2014 incident has resurfaced at an awkward time for Prague and Moscow.

The Czech Republic is planning to put the construction of a new nuclear power plant at its Dukovany complex out to tender.

Security services have demanded that Russia's Rosatom be excluded as a security risk, while President Milos Zeman and other senior officials have been putting Russia's case.

In a text message, Industry Minister Karel Havlicek, who was previously in favour of including Russia, told Reuters: ""The probability that Rosatom will participate in the expansion of Dukovany is very low.""

REUTERS/Tom Brenner

President Joe Biden on Friday sought to present a united front with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to counter an increasingly assertive China as the U.S. leader held his first face-to-face White House summit since taking office.

The talks offered the Democratic president, inaugurated in January, a chance to work further on his pledge to revitalize U.S. alliances that frayed under his Republican predecessor Donald Trump.

China topped the agenda, underscoring Japan’s central role in U.S. efforts to face down Beijing. The two leaders addressed an array of geopolitical issues in a joint statement, including “the importance of peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait,” a slap at Beijing’s increased military pressure on the Chinese-claimed, self-ruled island.

“Today Prime Minister Suga and I affirmed our ironclad support for the U.S.-Japanese alliance and for our shared security,” Biden told a joint news conference in the White House Rose Garden, calling the discussions “productive.”

“We committed to working together to take on the challenges from China and on issues like the East China Sea, the South China Sea, as well as North Korea, to ensure a future of a free and open Indo Pacific.”

Other pressing concerns at the talks included China’s increased military movements near Taiwan, its tightening grip on Hong Kong and its crackdown on Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang.

Suga said he and Biden agreed on the necessity of frank discussions with China in the context of Beijing’s activities in the Indo-Pacific region.

In a strongly worded statement on Saturday, China’s embassy in Washington said Beijing was “resolutely opposed” to the joint statement, and that Taiwan, Hong Kong and Xinjiang were China’s internal affairs.

The remarks have “completely gone beyond the scope of the normal development of bilateral relations”, harming the interests of third parties as well as peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific, the embassy said.

The move was an attempt to split the region that “will inevitably proceed with the purpose of harming others and end in harming themselves”, it added.

The summit - Biden’s first in-person meeting with a foreign leader as president - came just days after China sent 25 aircraft, including fighters and nuclear-capable bombers, near Taiwan, which Beijing considers a wayward province.

“I refrain from mentioning details, since it pertains to diplomatic exchanges, but there is already an agreed recognition over the importance of peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait between Japan and the United States, which was reaffirmed on this occasion,” Suga said.

The joint leaders’ statement included the first reference to Taiwan since 1969, before Tokyo normalized ties with Beijing, using similar phrasing by the foreign and defense ministers of both countries after a meeting last month.

Attention had been focused on the wording on Taiwan and other sensitive issues, given caution in Tokyo about the need to balance its security concerns with Japan’s deep economic ties with China.

DIGITAL COMPETITIVENESS, HUMAN RIGHTS

Taiwan’s government welcomed the show of support, and called on China to act responsibly.

“We hope the Beijing authorities will fulfill their responsibilities as part of the Taiwan Strait and region and jointly make positive contributions to stability and well being,” presidential office spokesman Xavier Chang said in a statement.

In another swipe at China, Biden told the news conference the United States and Japan will invest together in areas such as 5G, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, genomics and semiconductor supply chains.

The joint statement said the United States had committed $2.5 billion and Japan $2 billion to strengthen digital competitiveness including in 5G and beyond 5G networks.

“Japan and the United States are both deeply invested in innovation and looking to the future,” Biden said. “That includes making sure we invest in and protect technologies that will maintain and sharpen our competitive edge.”

Speaking later to a Washington think tank, Suga said Japan would say what is needed to be said to China and speak up on human rights, while also stressing the need to establish a stable, constructive relationship with Beijing.

The leaders’ statement said they “share serious concerns” about the human rights situation in Hong Kong and China’s Xinjiang region, where Washington has said Beijing is perpetrating a genocide against Muslim Uighurs. China has denied abuses.

Japan has been criticized for not taking stronger action on alleged human rights abuses for fear of a backlash that could hurt its firms with business in China, its biggest trade partner.

At the White House news conference, Suga said he told Biden that he was committed to moving forward with the summer Olympic Games in Japan and that Biden offered his support. Japan is grappling with rising coronavirus infections with fewer than 100 days until the planned start.

“I told the president about my determination to realize the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic games this summer as a symbol of global unity,” Suga said.

As they sat down for talks, Biden, Suga and their two delegations all wore masks, in keeping with protocols to protect against the spread of COVID-19.

Biden appeared determined to get off on the right foot with Suga after four years in which Trump sometimes chastised allies in Asia and elsewhere over what he saw as insufficient defense spending or funding for U.S. troop presence and questioned the value of bedrock military alliances.

With the Suga meeting and another planned summit with South Korea in May, Biden hopes to energize joint efforts with Australia, India and Japan in a grouping known as the Quad, as well as with South Korea, to counter China and longtime U.S. foe North Korea.

0,42 migrants dead after boat from Yemen capsizes off Djibouti coast,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/13/africa/migrants-dead-djibouti-intl/index.html,"(CNN) At least 42 migrants have died after a boat they were travelling in from Yemen capsized off the coast of Djibouti, East Africa, during the early hours of Monday morning, the United Nations' International Organization for Migration (IOM) said on Tuesday.

0,Still no proof that Russia paid Taliban bounties for dead Americans,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/remember-those-russian-bounties-dead-u-s-troops-biden-admin-n1264215,"WASHINGTON — While he was campaigning for president, Joe Biden treated as fact that U.S. intel agencies had determined Russia had paid the Taliban to kill Americans in Afghanistan.

""I don't understand why this president is unwilling to take on Putin when he's actually paying bounties to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan,"" Biden said of President Trump, speaking to Kristen Welker of NBC News during the Oct. 22 presidential debate.

Such a definitive statement was questionable even then. On Thursday, it became more clear that the truth of the matter is unresolved.

Last fall, while Biden was a candidate, Pentagon officials told NBC News they could not substantiate that such bounties were paid.

They still have not found any evidence, a senior defense official said Thursday. And the Biden administration also made clear in a fact sheet released Thursday that the CIA's intelligence on the matter is far from conclusive, acknowledging that analysts labeled it ""low to moderate confidence.""

The White House fact sheet explaining new sanctions over Russian misbehavior made clear that Russia was not being sanctioned over the issue. It used careful language, referring to ""reported Afghanistan bounties.""

""The administration is responding to the reports that Russia encouraged Taliban attacks against U.S. and coalition personnel in Afghanistan based on the best assessments from the Intelligence Community,"" the fact sheet says. ""Given the sensitivity of this matter, which involves the safety and well-being of our forces, it is being handled through diplomatic, military and intelligence channels.""

In intelligence parlance, moderate confidence means the information is plausible and credibly sourced, but not quite corroborated enough to merit a higher rating.

Low confidence means the analysis was based on questionable or implausible information — or information too fragmented or poorly corroborated to make solid inferences. It can also reflect problems with the credibility of the sources.

It's perhaps the latest example of how much uncertainty pervades the gray world of espionage, in which sources aren't always reliable and intercepted communications don't always mean what they seem to. As former CIA director Michael Hayden has said, ""If it was a fact, it wouldn't be intelligence.""

Asked at a press briefing Thursday whether the White House believed the CIA assessment, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki did not answer directly. She said the reason the confidence level was “low to moderate,” is because some of the information came from Afghan detainees, and also due to the challenging operating environment in Afghanistan.

“This information really puts the burden on Russia and the Russian government to explain their engagement here,” she added.

After Biden became president — and began receiving more detailed intelligence briefings — his comments about the alleged Russian incentive payments became more careful. On Jan. 25, for example, he referred to ""reports of bounties.""

The Russian government has denied paying bounties to the Taliban to kill Americans.

Democrats pilloried the Trump administration because the president never raised the issue of alleged bounties with the Russians. Many foreign policy experts said they should have done so, even if the evidence didn't add up to proof.

But in making those criticisms, Democrats, including Biden, imbued the intelligence with a certainty that appears to have been unmerited.

U.S. intelligence agencies have for years documented Russian financial and military support to the Taliban, but the news that the CIA detected a Russian program to incentivize the killing of American service members — first reported last year by the New York Times — appeared to represent a significant escalation.

Officials familiar with the matter told NBC News that the CIA based its findings on two main avenues of intelligence: Financial records seized in a raid in Afghanistan and comments by a detainee.

Military officials say they have looked hard but found no other evidence to corroborate that such a program existed.

In September, Gen. Frank McKenzie, commander of the U.S. Central Command, whose remit includes Afghanistan, told NBC News, ""It just has not been proved to a level of certainty that satisfies me.""

""We continue to look for that evidence,"" the general added. ""I just haven't seen it yet. But … it's not a closed issue.""

McKenzie's comments reflected a consensus view in the military. Defense Secretary Mark Esper told the House Armed Services Committee in July that ""All the defense intelligence agencies have been unable to corroborate that report. ""That has not changed, a senior official with direct knowledge told NBC News Thursday.

McKenzie said in September that if he could establish that the Russians were offering payments to kill Americans, he would push to forcefully respond. But the intelligence is far from conclusive, he said.

""I found what they presented to me very concerning, very worrisome. I just couldn't see the final connection, so I sent my guys back and said, look, keep digging. So we have continued to dig and look because this involves potential threats to U.S. forces, it's open,"" he said, adding, ""I just haven't seen anything that closes that gap yet.""

A U.S. military official familiar with the intelligence added at the time that after a review of the intelligence around each attack against Americans going back several years, none has been tied to any Russian incentive payments.

McKenzie could not be reached for comment, but the official familiar with the intelligence told NBC News Thursday that no Taliban attack had been tied to Russia.",893,5685,11,67

The Federal Security Service (FSB) of Russia searched the home of Anin on Friday, took him in for questioning at which Anin refused to answer questions, and later released him.

Anin, editor-in-chief of independent investigative media outlet iStories, wrote back in 2016 an investigative piece in Russian opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta, claiming that Igor Sechin, Rosneft’s chief executive and an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was connected with one of the most luxurious yachts in the world, St. Princess Olga. Sechin sued Novaya Gazeta for defamation and won the lawsuit in 2016.

The case was re-opened last month on the grounds of privacy violations, and Anin is listed as a witness.

Anin’s lawyer, Anna Stavitskaya, told the outlet New Prospect in an interview after Anin’s questioning on Friday that the Federal Security Service doesn’t lead the re-opened case but it is involved in it, “perhaps everyone sees why FSB—the case is connected with Sechin,” she said.

The European Union and investigative reporters’ associations expressed concern with the Russian questioning of Roman Anin.

“On the face of it, this appears to be a dark day for freedom of the media in Russia. We stand fully behind Anin’s fearless exposure of figures from the criminal and political underworld,” said Gerard Ryle, director of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).

The EU is concerned about the recent raid and the actions against Anin, Peter Stano, Lead Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, said in a statement.

“It is the duty of media to report on issues of public interest. State authorities should ensure that journalists are able to carry out their legitimate work and not hinder or intimidate them,” Stano said.

This week, multiple tech executives offered their own dismal estimates as part of their usual public financial disclosures, with the worst one coming in at ""a couple of years.""

That nasty estimate comes from Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, who offered that vague timeframe to The Washington Post in an interview on Tuesday. He clarified that was an estimate for how long it would take the company to ""build capacity"" to potentially address supply shortages. The conversation came as Intel offered to step up for two supply chains particularly pinched by the silicon drought: medical supplies and in-car computer systems.

In previous statements, Gelsinger pointed to Intel's current $20 billion plan to build a pair of factories in Arizona, and this week's interview added praise for President Joe Biden's proposed $50 billion chip-production infrastructure plan—though Gelsinger indicated that Biden should be ready to spend more than that.

TSMC CEO C.C. Wei offered a similarly dire estimate to investors on Thursday, saying that the Taiwan-based company hoped to ""offer more capacity"" for meeting retail and manufacturing demand ""in 2023."" TSMC, coincidentally, is moving forward with a manufacturing plant of its own in Arizona, which Bloomberg claims could cost ""up to $12 billion,"" despite the company clarifying that it intends to prioritize research, development, and production in its home nation.

Graphics card and SoC producer Nvidia joined the grim estimate club this week , though Nvidia has a more optimistic belief that it will emerge with ""sufficient supply to support sequential growth beyond [fiscal] Q1 [2022],"" according to CFO Colette Kress. Until then, ""we expect demand to continue to exceed supply for much of this year,"" she added. (Having seen the comment sections of recent GPU reviews at Ars Technica , we sure believe that.)

But as tech companies scramble to navigate natural disasters, exponential consumer demand, and the building of brand-new facilities, some questions remain unanswered. How will so much scaling up of new factories turn out? Will they meet their construction deadlines, and will they be anywhere near as efficient as promised or hoped once their lines open up?

0,The Reasons Behind South Korea’s LG Exit from Mobile Phone Business,https://ayedot.com/118/MiniBlog/Reasons-Behind-Exit-of-South-Korea%E2%80%99s-LG-from-Mobile-Phone-Business,"South Korea’s LG stated that it is exiting the global mobile phone business, on Monday, April 5.

The main reasons stated by LG for quitting Mobile Phone Business were:

The mobile phone sector has become “incredibly competitive”

To focus more on key growth areas like electric vehicle components, connected devices, smart homes, robotics, artificial intelligence, and business-to-business solutions, as well as platforms and services.

Wanted to get out of its loss-making mobile phone business.

LG was earlier the 3rd largest mobile phone producer but has lost market share to Apple, Samsung, Chinese Mobile Companies, and other competitors

Since 2016, LG’s mobile unit had lost around $4.5 billion, so it was expected that soon LG was going to exit the mobile business.

Other factors also played a role like a lack of essential innovation, dull camera tech, inconsistency with hardware faults, software updates poor compared to competitors, and challenges in achieving durable chip supplies.

So from LG will focus much more on its key successful home appliances and OLED TV businesses.

After this announcement, the company's shares fell 2.5% on Monday.",180,1161,11,67
0,Hong Kong pro-democracy figures given jail terms of up to 18 months,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/16/jimmy-lai-martin-lee-hong-kong-pro-democracy-figures-sentenced?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other,"A court in Hong Kong has handed down a mixture of prison and suspended sentences to 10 of the territory’s most prominent pro-democracy figures, including reformers, politicians and a media mogul, some veterans of the transition from British rule in the 1990s.

The prison sentences for organising or participating in an unauthorised assembly – traditionally a low-level offence attracting fines – are a highly symbolic blow to the pro-democracy movement, which has been targeted by authorities bent on removing all opposition to Beijing.

Those sentenced included Jimmy Lai, a 72-year-old billionaire media mogul and democracy activist, and veteran labour leader and outspoken organiser Lee Cheuk-yan, 64. Fellow defendant Martin Lee, 82, known as the father of democracy, had never faced trial until this year. Nor had Margaret Ng, 73, a former legislator and highly respected lawyer who in a powerful speech on Friday told the court the law was supposed to protect the people’s rights.

The sentences related to two rallies held in August 2019. Lai and Lee Cheuk-yan were each sentenced to 14 months in jail. The activist “Long Hair” Leung Kwok-hung received the longest sentence, of 18 months. Martin Lee and Margaret Ng were given 11 and 12 months respectively, but both sentences were suspended for two years.

The former Democratic party chairman Yeung Sum, 73, was given a suspended sentence of eight months.

Outside court, the 69-year-old lawyer Albert Ho, who was given a 12-month sentence suspended for two years, said the sentences were “shocking and totally unthinkable”. He said the judge treated any act of assembly without police approval as “disruption to the social order”. Ordinarily such convictions would only attract a fine, Ho said, but instead the judge set sentences at 18 months before reductions.

Asked how he felt about the verdict, Martin Lee said only that he was going home for a rest.

Lai, who is facing other charges including under a draconian national security law imposed by Beijing last year, has been detained on remand since late last year.

Prosecutors laid a further national security charge against Lai on Friday, accusing him of conspiracy to collude with foreign forces, and another criminal charge of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Both reportedly relate to the case of Andy Li, an activist who was caught by Chinese authorities attempting to flee Hong Kong for Taiwan by boat.

Lai’s repeated arrests and related raid of his newsrooms have drawn international condemnation. Lee is also facing a number of other protest-related cases this year, and had previously told the Guardian he expected to be jailed.

During mitigation, Ng told the court that laws should “give protection to rights, not take them away, especially in Hong Kong where structural democracy is absent”.

Ng said there was “no right so precious to the people of Hong Kong as the freedom of expression and the freedom of peaceful assembly”.

Dozens of people queued to enter the West Kowloon court on Friday morning, including foreign diplomats and former Hong Kong legislators.

Outside the court the defendants held up their hands to signal “five demands, not one less”, the rallying cry of the movement. Lee Cheuk-yan urged Hong Kong people to “hold on”.

“I’m ready to face the penalty and sentencing and I’m proud that I can walk with the people of Hong Kong for this democracy,” he said. “We will walk together even in darkness.”

Prosecutors had accused the individuals of organising or participating in unauthorised assemblies on two dates in August 2019, at the height of the mass pro-democracy protests that brought the city to a standstill.

Entering his plea, Lee Cheuk-yan told the court the group had done nothing wrong, and “history would absolve us”.

The prison sentences were quickly condemned. “The prosecutions, convictions and heavy custodial sentences of these dignified and experienced democrats, for their peaceful role in a protest sends a chilling message to Hong Kong citizens that free expression and peaceful protest may result in prison sentences,” said Schona Jolly QC, the chair of the Bar Human Rights Committee of England and Wales.

Amnesty International’s Asia-Pacific regional director, Yamini Mishra, said the convictions were against international law. “The wrongful prosecution, conviction and sentencing of these activists underlines the Hong Kong government’s intention to eliminate all political opposition in the city,” Mishra said.

Chris Patten, a former British governor of Hong Kong, said the cases saw “some of the most distinguished of the city’s peaceful and moderate champions of liberty and democracy placed in Beijing’s vengeful sights”.

“The CCP [Chinese Communist party] simply does not understand that you cannot bludgeon and incarcerate people into loving a totalitarian and corrupt regime,” he said.

More than 10,200 people have been arrested in relation to the mass protests of 2019, which began as opposition to a proposed bill allowing extradition to China but evolved into broader pro-democracy movement. There were frequent violent confrontations between protesters and police, who were accused of brutality.

A subsequent crackdown by authorities, using existing criminal laws, the national security law introduced by Beijing in 2020, and anti-pandemic laws have ended mass protests, and more than 100 people have been arrested under suspicion of national security offences, including much of the opposition camp.

REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov

The United States on Thursday imposed a broad array of sanctions on Russia, including curbs to its sovereign debt market, to punish it for interfering in last year’s U.S. election, cyber hacking, bullying Ukraine and other alleged malign actions.

The U.S. government blacklisted Russian companies, expelled Russian diplomats and barred U.S. banks from buying sovereign bonds from Russia's central bank, national wealth fund and Finance Ministry. The United States warned Russia that more penalties were possible but said it did not want to escalate.

The Russian Foreign Ministry reacted angrily, summoning the U.S. ambassador for a diplomatic dressing-down to tell him ""a series of retaliatory measures will follow soon."" A ministry spokeswoman also said a possible summit could be imperiled.

Russia denies meddling in U.S. elections, orchestrating a cyber hack that used U.S. tech company SolarWinds Corp (SWI.N) to penetrate U.S. government networks and using a nerve agent to poison Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.

U.S. President Joe Biden spoke on Tuesday to Russian President Vladimir Putin to raise concerns about those issues and the buildup of Russian forces in Crimea and along the border with Ukraine, although a top U.S. general saw only a “low-to-medium” risk of a Russian invasion in the next few weeks.

Biden, who also proposed a U.S.-Russian summit, is trying to strike a balance between deterring what Washington sees as hostile Russian behavior, while avoiding a deeper deterioration in U.S.-Russian ties and preserving some room for cooperation.

""My bottom line is this: There is an interest in the United States to work with Russia. We should and we will,"" Biden said in remarks to the press.

But ""when Russia seeks to violate the interests of the United States, we will respond,"" he said. ""I was clear with President Putin that we could have gone further, but I chose not to do so. I chose to be proportionate.""

Russia said Washington’s actions contradicted a stated U.S. desire to normalize relations with Moscow. The sanctions are hostile steps that heighten the countries’ confrontation, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said.

Among his moves, Biden signed an executive order authorizing the U.S. government to impose sanctions on any area of the Russian economy and used it to restrict Russia’s ability to issue sovereign debt to punish Moscow for interfering in the 2020 U.S. election.

Biden barred U.S. financial institutions from taking part in the primary market for rouble-denominated Russian sovereign bonds from June 14. U.S. banks have been barred from taking part in the primary market for non-rouble sovereign bonds since 2019.

He did not prohibit them, however, from buying such debt in the secondary market, a step likely to have a far more dramatic effect on the Russian bond and currency markets, which fell as news of the sanctions seeped out before recovering some losses.

The Treasury also blacklisted 32 entities and individuals that it said had carried out Russian government-directed attempts to influence the 2020 presidential election and other ""acts of disinformation and interference.""

ANALYST: RUSSIA TO CONTINUE TESTING U.S.

In concert with the European Union, Britain, Australia and Canada, the Treasury also put sanctions on eight individuals associated with Moscow's occupation of Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.

The White House said it was expelling 10 Russian diplomats in Washington, including representatives of the Russian intelligence services, and for the first time, formally named the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) as the perpetrator of the SolarWinds hack. The agency said the allegations were “nonsense” and “windbaggery.”

The U.S. government plans a new executive order to strengthen its cybersecurity, a U.S. official told reporters, suggesting it could include such elements as encryption and multifactor authentication.

The White House also said it would respond to reports Russia had offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants to kill U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan. U.S. intelligence agencies have ""low-to-moderate"" confidence in their assessment of those reports, in part because they rely on sometimes undependable testimony from detainees, it said.

Russia has long brushed off allegations of putting bounties on U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan.

Andrew Weiss, a Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank analyst, was skeptical the U.S. sanctions would change a ""largely competitive and adversarial relationship"" in the short term or deter Russia in the long term.

""I'd be surprised if today's very calibrated announcements by the Biden administration materially shift the relationship in either direction,"" he said, saying Russia was willing to cooperate on some issues but there was unlikely ever to be a meeting of the minds on Ukraine or election interference.

""I don't think it's realistic to expect the new sanctions will shift Russia's risk calculus in a fundamental fashion,"" he added. ""It's to be expected that the Russians will keep probing and testing our resolve.""

The report, citing experts’ opinion, suggested that tritium released into the sea will be dispersed and diluted in the several years it will take to arrive in South Korean waters.

The Japanese government announced a decision Tuesday to release water from the disaster-crippled Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant into the sea after it is diluted. But tritium, a radioactive substance, cannot be removed in the process.

The South Korean report said there was no problem with Japanese facilities to remove most radioactive substances from water. The possibility that tritium will bring significant exposure to radiation from consuming fisheries products is extremely low, it said.

The report also said that Japan’s evaluation of radiation effects in nearby regions was reasonable.

The South Korean Office for Government Policy Coordination said that the experts’ opinion reflected in the report differed from the government’s position on the matter.

The office reiterated Seoul’s opposition to the release of water from the Fukushima plant and said the South Korean government was exploring a number of options such as bringing the matter to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.",221,1416,10,67

REUTERS/Annegret Hilse/Pool

The COVID-19 pandemic prompted a rise in domestic violence, online fraud and child pornography last year in Germany, although there were fewer break-ins and car thefts as lockdowns kept people at home, police data showed on Thursday.

Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said an overall trend of falling crimes continued last year as 5.3 million offences were reported, one million fewer than in 2017.

""The contact and movement restrictions have had a grave impact on the lives of citizens in Germany,"" Seehofer told a news conference with police chiefs. ""During the lockdowns, life has been taking place largely in the private sphere and this has affected the nature of crime.""

Car theft incidents were down by about 16%, break-ins by 14% and pickpocketing fell by 11%.

This compared with an 11.5% increase in online fraud as criminals tried to cash in on a surge in internet shopping as most retailers shut their doors.

Seehofer said there was a rise in reported domestic violence mainly against women, but did not give any figures as the data was incomplete. He said the reported incidents were most likely only a fraction of the real numbers.

Child pornography crimes rose by more than 54% compared to 2019. The increase was partly the result of Germany receiving more tip-offs on the production, distribution and possession of child pornography from the U.S.-based National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.

Jeff J Mitchell/Pool via REUTERS

The ruling Scottish National Party pledged on Thursday to hold an independence referendum by the end of 2023, a step that could fracture the United Kingdom by ripping apart the 314-year union between England and Scotland.

If there was another referendum and the Scots voted out, it would mark the biggest shock to the United Kingdom since Irish independence a century ago - just as London grapples with the impact of both Brexit and the COVID-19 crisis.

Scotland voted against independence by 55% to 45% in 2014, but Nicola Sturgeon's Scottish National Party (SNP) wants another referendum if it wins the Scottish Parliament election on May 6. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly dismissed SNP calls for a referendum.

""We believe the people of Scotland should have the opportunity in a referendum when the COVID crisis is over to decide whether Scotland should be an independent country,"" the SNP said in its manifesto published on Thursday.

""The SNP intention is for the referendum to be within the first half of the five year term,"" the SNP said, adding that the date of the referendum would be ""determined by our democratically elected parliament"".

Although Johnson has the power to refuse another independence vote he would likely face a constitutional showdown with Scotland.

The SNP said that if it won a majority in May then the Scottish Parliament would pass a referendum bill, which proposes that the question on the ballot be: ""Should Scotland be an independent country?""

""There can be no moral or democratic justification for Boris Johnson or any Westminster government to obstruct the right of the people of Scotland to decide their own future,"" the SNP said.

The SNP currently has 61 of the 129 seats in the Scottish Parliament but by working with the Greens' 5 lawmakers, it has effective control of the devolved parliament.

The nations of Britain have shared the same monarch since James VI of Scotland became James I of England in 1603 and a formal union created the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707.

But Brexit - and Johnson's handling of the COVID-19 crisis - have strained the ties that bind together England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales into the United Kingdom.

The United Kingdom as whole voted 52%-48% to leave the EU in a 2016 referendum: England and Wales voted to leave but Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to stay.

0,UFO sightings near warships confirmed by Pentagon after images leak,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1419488/ufo-sightings-near-warships-confirmed-by-pentagon-after-images-leak,"Sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) flying near US Navy warships have been confirmed by the Pentagon and are currently under investigation.

The Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF) has been gathering photos and videos of such incidents as part of a comprehensive report to the US Congress due this June, as per Mystery Wire on April 8.

ADVERTISEMENT

Some of these materials were obtained by investigative filmmaker Jeremy Corbell, who published these online on the same day via his website, extraordinarybeliefs.com.

Corbell, along with renowned investigative journalist George Knapp, verified the authenticity of these materials as well as the information provided by the task force.

One of the videos from July 2019, which was taken by Navy officers with a night vision device, shows a pyramid-shaped UFO hovering 700 feet above the USS Russell off San Diego, California.

Corbell also shared the footage and the photos of the said incident via Twitter and other social media accounts on April 9.

May 1st 2020 a classified briefing was generated about the UFO / UAP presence via the Office of Naval Intelligence.

While others claim that these flying objects are either drones or weather balloons, the UAPTF and the Navy have classified them as “unknowns” for now, the report said. An unidentified flying object is not necessarily an extraterrestial object.

Corbell noted on his website that the pyramid-shaped UFOs were first shown in a classified briefing on May 1, 2020, about UFO or UAP presence via the Office of Naval Intelligence.

“Those familiar with the briefing articulated to me that the goal was to de-stigmatize the UAP problem and to promote more intelligence collection regarding UAP incursions and encounters with active military deployments,” he shared.

Aside from the pyramid-shaped UFOs, Corbell also shared that part of the briefing focused on the incident between the USS Omaha and a spherical craft.

Corbell noted that the Navy suspects this craft to be a “trans-medium” vehicle, as it was observed by Navy personnel to descend into the ocean after flying.

The Pentagon also confirmed the authenticity of the materials Corbell published after Mystery Wire reached out for a comment.

“I can confirm that the referenced photos and videos were taken by Navy personnel. The UAPTF has included these incidents in their ongoing examinations,” Pentagon spokesperson Susan Gough was quoted as saying in a statement sent to Mystery Wire on April 9.

The US military, however, maintained that it will not disclose any more information regarding the phenomena.

“As we have said before, to maintain operations security and to avoid disclosing information that may be useful to potential adversaries, [Department of Defense] does not discuss publicly the details of either the observations or the examinations of reported incursions into our training ranges or designated airspace, including those incursions initially designated as UAP,” the Pentagon spokesperson said.

0,Matteo Salvini to face trial over standoff with migrant rescue ship,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/17/matteo-salvini-trial-standoff-migrant-rescue-ship,"A judge in Sicily has ordered the former Italian interior minister Matteo Salvini to stand trial for refusing to let a Spanish migrant rescue ship dock in an Italian port in 2019, keeping the people at sea for days.

Judge Lorenzo Iannelli set 15 September as the trial date during a court hearing in Palermo, LaPresse news agency reported.

Salvini, who attended the hearing, confirmed the outcome and said he was only doing his job and his duty by refusing entry to the Open Arms rescue ship and the 147 people it had rescued in the Mediterranean Sea.

Citing the Italian constitution, Salvini tweeted that defending the country was the “sacred duty” of every Italian. “I’m going on trial for this, for having defended my country?” he said. “I’ll go with my head held high, also in your name.”

Palermo prosecutors have accused Salvini of dereliction of duty and kidnapping, for keeping the migrants at sea off the coast of Lampedusa for almost three weeks in August 2019. During the standoff, some people threw themselves overboard in desperation as the captain pleaded for a safe, close port. Eventually, after a 19-day ordeal, the remaining 83 migrants still onboard were allowed to disembark in Lampedusa.

Salvini had maintained a hard line on migration as interior minister during the first government of the then prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, from 2018-19. While demanding that EU nations do more to take in migrants arriving in Italy, Salvini argued that humanitarian rescue ships were only encouraging Libyan-based traffickers and that his policy saved lives by discouraging further risky trips across the Mediterranean.

His lawyer, Giulia Bongiorno, said she was certain the court would determine that no kidnapping was involved.

“There was no limitation on their freedom,” she told reporters after the indictment was handed down. “The ship had the possibility of going anywhere. There was just a prohibition of going into port. But it had 100,000 options.”

The group behind Open Arms welcomed the decision to put Salvini on trial. “We are happy for all the people we have rescued … in all these years,” it tweeted.

Salvini is also under investigation for another, similar migrant standoff involving the Italian coastguard ship Gregoretti, which Salvini refused to allow to dock in the summer of 2019.

The prosecutor in that case, Andrea Bonomo of Catania in Sicily, advised against a trial, arguing that Salvini was carrying out government policy when he kept the 116 migrants at sea for five days.",414,2518,11,67

That is up from around 20 percent at the moment and far higher than the 3.67 percent stipulated in the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied the allegations about the attack on Natanz. Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif tweeted as talks got under way on Thursday: ""Iran's seriousness of purpose in pursuing diplomacy was tested in the three years since Trump withdrew from the nuclear accord. Iran – by remaining in the deal – passed with flying colors. ""The Biden administration, however, has only shown a commitment to Trump's maximum pressure.""

0,U.S. Intel Walks Back Claim Russians Put Bounties on American Troops,https://www.thedailybeast.com/us-intel-walks-back-claim-russians-put-bounties-on-american-troops?fbclid=IwAR3PYJKlKTqp0usjoGb2aYsZkdupf8RbGqbhIC3mpvcSor8njBAEEnTfoN4,"It was a blockbuster story about Russia’s return to the imperial “Great Game” in Afghanistan. The Kremlin had spread money around the longtime central Asian battlefield for militants to kill remaining U.S. forces. It sparked a massive outcry from Democrats and their #resistance amplifiers about the treasonous Russian puppet in the White House whose admiration for Vladimir Putin had endangered American troops.

But on Thursday, the Biden administration announced that U.S. intelligence only had “low to moderate” confidence in the story after all. Translated from the jargon of spyworld, that means the intelligence agencies have found the story is, at best, unproven—and possibly untrue.

“The United States intelligence community assesses with low to moderate confidence that Russian intelligence officers sought to encourage Taliban attacks on U.S. and coalition personnel in Afghanistan in 2019 and perhaps earlier,” a senior administration official said.

“ U.S. intelligence only had ‘low to moderate’ confidence in the story. Translated from the jargon of spyworld, that means the intelligence agencies have found the story is, at best, unproven—and possibly untrue. ”

“This information puts a burden on the Russian government to explain its actions and take steps to address this disturbing pattern of behavior,” the official said, indicating that Biden is unprepared to walk the story back fully.

Significantly, the Biden team announced a raft of sanctions on Thursday. But those sanctions, targeting Russia’s sovereign debt market, are prompted only by Russia’s interference in the 2020 election and its alleged role in the SolarWinds cyber espionage. (In contrast, Biden administration officials said that their assessment attributing the breach of technology company SolarWinds to hackers from Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service was “high confidence.”)

“We have noted our conclusion of the review that we conducted on the bounties issue and we have conveyed through diplomatic, intelligence, and military channels strong, direct messages on this issue, but we are not specifically tying the actions we are taking today to that matter,” a senior administration official told reporters in reference to the bounty claims.

According to the officials on Thursday’s call, the reporting about the alleged “bounties” came from “detainee reporting”–raising the specter that someone told their U.S.-aligned Afghan jailers what they thought was necessary to get out of a cage. Specifically, the official cited “information and evidence of connections to criminal agents in Afghanistan and elements of the Russian government” as sources for the intelligence community’s assessment.

Without additional corroboration, such reporting is notoriously unreliable. Detainee reporting from a man known as Ibn Shaikh al-Libi, extracted from torture, infamously and bogusly fueled a Bush administration claim, used to invade Iraq, about Saddam Hussein training al Qaeda to make poison gas.

The senior Biden official added on Thursday that the “difficult operating environment in Afghanistan” complicated U.S. efforts to confirm what amounts to a rumor.

When asked whether Moscow put bounties on American forces in Afghanistan, press secretary Jen Psaki said at a press briefing on Thursday that the Biden administration “felt the reports were enough of a cause for concern that we wanted our intelligence community to look into this report as a part of this overall assessment.”

Psaki reiterated the intelligence community’s low-to-moderate confidence in its assessment about possible Russian bounties but said that U.S. intelligence had “high confidence” in a separate assessment that Russian military intelligence officers “manage interaction with individuals in Afghan criminal networks” and that the “involvement of this... unit is consistent with Russia’s encouraging attacks against U.S. and coalition personnel in Afghanistan.”

“I am unsurprised that the review led to a murky determination of low to moderate confidence. While it is clear that Russia and other adversaries have been providing assistance to their proxies in Afghanistan, identifying type and amount of such assistance with great specificity has been the persistent challenge,” Jason Campbell, an Afghanistan policy official in the Obama Pentagon, told The Daily Beast.

There were reasons to doubt the story from the start. Not only did the initial stories emphasize its basis on detainee reporting, but the bounties represented a qualitative shift in recent Russian engagements with Afghan insurgents. Russian operatives have long been suspected of moving money to various Afghan militants: an out-of-favor former Taliban official told The Daily Beast on the record that Russia gave them cash for years. But the Russians had not been suspected of sponsoring attacks on U.S. forces outright–an escalation that risked confrontation with the U.S., and occurring long after it could have made a difference in the war.

As well, there seemed to be no “causative link” to any actual U.S. deaths, in the judgment of Gen. Frank McKenzie, the senior U.S. general for the Middle East and South Asia. Former U.S. diplomats and intelligence officers told The Daily Beast last summer that they viewed the bounties account skeptically. One retired diplomat suspected “someone leaked this to slow down the troop withdrawal.”

“ Former U.S. diplomats and intelligence officers told The Daily Beast last summer that they viewed the bounties account skeptically. One suspected, ‘someone leaked this to slow down the troop withdrawal.’ ”

Rarely discussed was the main reason to believe the story: the CIA actually did fund Afghan guerillas to kill Russian forces during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan of the 1980s.

The Pentagon said at the time that its massive intelligence apparatus, which includes both battlefield intelligence and the world’s most sophisticated surveillance network, did not generate the bounties story. In September, McKenzie said that the intelligence remained uncorroborated. “It just has not been proved to a level of certainty that satisfies me,” he told NBC News.

In the weeks following the existence of the uncorroborated Russian-bounty intel first breaking in The New York Times last summer, then-President Trump would repeatedly demand in closed-door meetings that whoever leaked the information be found, punished, or even “locked up,” according to sources and former administration officials with knowledge of what transpired at the time.

The initial set of Times bounty articles caught a number of senior White House staffers off-guard at first, who scrambled to figure out what was going on. One of the then-president's initial instincts was, naturally, that this was relayed to the press to make him look bad, and he would tell five individuals close to him that it further convinced him that the United States should pull its forces out of Afghanistan.

But in various meetings at the White House and in private conversations that followed that summer, Trump would continue to speculate on how or why this could have ended up in the media, three people familiar with the matter said. At times, he said he believed it was done by officials who wanted Joe Biden to win the 2020 election, or who wanted to stay and fight in Afghanistan “forever.” He demanded to know who in the CIA or intelligence community could have possibly done this to him.

“ Trump mentioned that he’d heard that the intel could have been ‘totally phony’ because it could have been drawn from intel sources who were saying anything after someone had ‘kicked the crap out of them.’ ”

At at least one point that summer, Trump mentioned that he'd heard that the intel could have been “totally phony” or manufactured because it could have been drawn from intel sources who didn't know what they were talking about, making up wild tales, or saying anything after someone had “kicked the crap out of them.”

That last speculation surprised, or somewhat confused, two of the sources who were familiar with the comment at the time, if only because Trump had repeatedly said for years that torture “absolutely works” and that the United States should revive waterboarding and other brutal measures against terror suspects. “It really sounded like the [then-]president was just grabbing for anything he could say,” one of these people recalled. “He was told by administration officials that the reporting was based on unverified claims, and he spun from that, I think.”

Regardless of whether the intelligence was fully corroborated or not, this didn't stop top officials in the Trump administration from sending notice to Russian counterparts. As The Daily Beast first reported in July, the U.S. State Department issued warnings to the Russian government that there would be a response if Moscow were then indeed caught paying bounties to Taliban fighters for the slayings of American troops in Afghanistan. Then-President Trump, for his part, publicly claimed that month that he did not raise the topic Russian leader Vladimir Putin. “That was a phone call to discuss other things, and frankly that’s an issue that many people said was fake news,” Trump said in an interview with Axios.

Meanwhile, Democrats ran with the election-time story. Then-candidate Biden called it a “horrifying revelation” if true. The senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, Robert Menendez (D-NJ), introduced a measure to sanction Russia for the alleged bounties. Congressional Democrats claimed to have been insufficiently briefed on the account, which the Trump White House called a “hoax,” and suggested there was a cover-up underway. When Trump himself denied being briefed on the story, House intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) remarked, “Is this an issue where they cannot tell the president things he doesn't want to hear when it comes to Vladimir Putin and Russia?”

0,"Royal fans defy Covid restrictions, flock to Windsor to say farewell",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/prince-philip-royal-fans-windsor-locals-turn-out-pay-tribute-n1264380,"WINDSOR, England — Prince Philip meticulously planned the final royal ceremony he would attend: his funeral. But he couldn't account for the coronavirus forcing royal planners to scale back the event.

Still, hundreds of mourners and well-wishers ignored public health advice to stay home due to Covid-19 restrictions, flocking to Windsor Castle to pay their final respects to the queen's consort, who died at age 99.

""I know they told us to stay away but we haven't,"" said Fiona Oldham, 53, an admin worker who traveled from near Blackpool in northwest England with her friends. ""I'm a real royalist — I absolutely love them.""

Oldham, who also attended the London funeral of Princess Diana in 1997, described Philip as a ""character"" and the ""power behind the throne"" of Queen Elizabeth II, offering his loyalty to the now-bereaved sovereign.

Like many gathered in Windsor, she was also keen to see Princes William and Harry together during the ceremonial procession Saturday, lamenting Harry's stateside move.

""We miss him. ... I'm hoping that the queen burns his passport,"" she said, chuckling. ""We feel that he's ours.""

Inside the castle, the royal family was honoring Philip's life and service to the queen, to whom he was married for 73 years. Military musicians outside St. George’s Chapel maintained a certain distance from each other, while inside just four choristers sang and 30 members of Philip's family wore masks. The queen sat alone and at a remove from the other attendees.

Outside the ancient castle's walls, Isabelle Wallace, a teacher from France, said she could not stay away.

""I'm a bit naughty. ... I think it's something to witness,"" Wallace, 50, said.

""My husband is Scottish and quite anti-royal — he's bald and he's washing his hair today,"" she added, acknowledging not everyone in Britain shared her royalist sentiments.

Wallace said she also couldn't ignore ""stories of his racism,"" referring to previous public remarks by the outspoken Philip, but added he'd done a lot for young people and the environment.

The Duke of Edinburgh was interred in a royal vault close to historic English kings such as Henry VIII and George VI, the queen's father, on Saturday. The funeral was organized by Philip, with hand-picked music, prayers and a specially adapted Land Rover hearse to carry his coffin.

The royal family has not been immune to the impacts of the virus either, with Prince Charles testing positive in March 2020. Both the queen and her late husband had also been vaccinated, according to Buckingham Palace.

Wandering around the busy town, Kaya Mar, 64, carried a large painting he'd made of Philip, calling it a tribute to his life.

""He's done a lot for this country and he was the glue for the royal family,"" Mar said. The painter, who traveled from London, added that Greek-born Philip hadn't had it easy in the royal establishment as ""an outsider.""

The queen, 94, who has called her husband her ""strength and stay,"" struck as a lonely figure sitting unaccompanied in St. George's Chapel.

Millions are expected to tune in from across the globe to the televised but muted funeral.

Many will take an interest from Commonwealth nations — a collection of mostly former British colonies — where the queen remains ceremonial head of state for some.

Matthew Callender remembers the excitement of seeing the queen and Philip in Barbados as a schoolchild in 1977. Now, working as head doorman at a Windsor hotel in the shadow of the castle, he said many back home would be sad.

""He was loved in Barbados and the Commonwealth because of his cheeky character; he was just a funny man,"" he said, holding the door.

Barbados, along with Jamaica, recently expressed interest in becoming a republic. But Callender said despite the politics, the queen and her late husband ""will always be loved.""",692,4153,11,68
0,Hong Kong marks ‘national security day’ with goose-steps and mascots,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1419646/hong-kong-marks-national-security-day-with-goose-steps-and-mascots,"HONG KONG — Hong Kong police displayed a cuddly bear mascot and unveiled a new goose-step march Thursday as the financial hub held a “National Security Education Day”, part of its push to instill patriotism in a city chafing under China’s rule.

Beijing blanketed Hong Kong in a sweeping national security law last year in response to months of huge and often violent democracy protests that convulsed the international business hub.

Thursday’s education day, the first since the security law’s imposition last June, saw activities held across the city that burnished the security forces and outlined the threats China perceives it faces in Hong Kong.

At a morning ceremony attended by senior officials, Luo Huining, Beijing’s top envoy in Hong Kong, gave a fiery speech vowing to “strike down hard resistance and regulate soft resistance”, warning that China was ready to “teach a lesson” to any foreign power trying to use the city “as a chess piece”.

“For all deeds that endanger national security and Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability, the central authorities will take action as necessary,” he said.

In 2019, huge crowds hit the streets for seven straight months demanding democracy and greater police accountability in the worst unrest since the city’s 1997 handover to China.

Beijing’s authoritarian leaders have dismissed the movement, portraying it as an insidious “foreign plot” to destroy China.

They have since embarked on a crackdown against critics and rolled out an official campaign — dubbed “staunch patriots governing Hong Kong” — to root out disloyalty towards the Chinese Communist Party.

Across town on Thursday, Hong Kong’s police college held an open day in which officers revealed a new goose-step march, the same style used by police and troops on the Chinese mainland.

The display was a symbolic break from Hong Kong’s British colonial past and Chinese army officers helped train police in the new style.

Tactical units then held an “anti-terrorism drill” which included officers rappelling from a helicopter to shoot dead pretend armed militants and a hostage-taker.

On the sidelines, guests wearing “I love police” t-shirts posed for selfies with a bear mascot dressed in tactical uniform.

Cuddly toy versions of the bear were also on sale for HK$400 ($52) alongside plastic toys of police officers holding tear gas warning flags.

Schools have been a major focus for authorities as they seek to incubate loyalty from an early age and national security day activities were held across classrooms featuring “games and puzzles”.

Education authorities have already ordered children as young as six to be taught about the four new national security crimes — subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.

The Correctional Services Department also held open days where guests could don a virtual reality headset to experience what it is like to be a prison guard.

More than 10,000 people were arrested during pro-democracy protests and more than 2,500 charged.

Over 100 people have also been arrested under the new security law, mostly pro-democracy politicians and opposition figures.

0,Russian prosecutors move to liquidate Navalny’s ‘extremist’ movement,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/16/russian-prosecutors-move-to-liquidate-navalnys-extremist-movement,"The Moscow prosecutor’s office has announced that it will seek to designate Alexei Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation and his regional political headquarters as “extremist groups”, moving to in effect liquidate the jailed opposition leader’s political organisation in Russia.

It is the most sweeping assault yet on supporters of Navalny, and comes after his two-and-a-half-year sentence on embezzlement charges and the arrest of his top aides on various charges following large protests in January and February.

In a statement released on Friday evening, the law enforcement body said it was seeking the designation usually reserved for violent organisations such as al-Qaida or Aum Shinrikyo, because it believed Navalny’s organisations were “creating conditions for changing the foundations of the constitutional order, including through the scenario of a ‘coloured revolution’”.

Coloured revolutions were pro-democracy uprisings in former Soviet republics in the mid-2000s now seen in Russia as western-backed coups. Navalny’s organisations have strongly criticised Vladimir Putin and his government, but have not called for any kind of armed rebellion to overthrow the Kremlin.

The decision, if approved, threatens to sever Navalny from his supporters in the regions and even from his financial donors, many of whom could be liable for financing an extremist group if they continued to provide support.

“They’ve decided to steamroll the Anti-Corruption Foundation and the headquarters,” wrote the head of the organisation, Ivan Zhdanov. “We won’t surrender.”

In a statement, he said: “The Kremlin has just demanded that anyone who does not agree with them to be called an extremist … It’s absolutely clear that the Kremlin’s new attack is connected with the planned protest and the elections in September.”

Leonid Volkov, another close Navalny ally, said the Friday evening press release was a “test of public opinion” and called Navalny supporters to make their voices heard.

The prosecutor’s office said that it had applied for a court ruling to recognise both organisations as extremist, which, if granted and upheld on appeal, would allow the government to fine and imprison members of the pro-Navalny groups.

On Friday, a former camera operator for Navalny was sentenced to two years in prison on extremism charges for writing two strongly worded tweets that said top Kremlin officials “didn’t deserve to live”. The tweets came after a regional journalist set herself on fire in an act of protest and died.

In the statement, the prosecutor’s office also claimed that Navalny’s organisation was acting in place of international bodies in Russia whose activities had been deemed “undesirable”. The statement in effect calls Navalny’s movement a front for western interests.

Navalny’s political movement has evolved over the last decade from a lone gadfly blogger on LiveJournal to a guerrilla newsroom, an opposition research centre and a campaign strategy headquarters seeking to unseat the United Russia party by channelling votes to its most likely opponents.

The Anti-Corruption Foundation has angered Russia’s elites by publishing investigations into their expensive watches, yachting trips, lovers’ trysts, inflated procurements and other aspects of government corruption that Navalny says has characterised the Putin era.

On Friday, it published its latest investigation into a lavish residence allegedly used by Putin, which is reportedly fitted out with a luxury spa complex with cryo chambers and a float pool, and which it claimed was rented from a close ally of Putin’s using taxpayers’ money.

The continuing investigations have proven that Navalny can be dangerous to the Kremlin even while he remains on hunger strike in a Russian prison. He was arrested upon returning to the country in January following treatment for a poisoning attempt on his life that he, in a joint investigation with Bellingcat, traced back to the Russian FSB.",606,3971,8,68
0,Highest French Court Rules Killer of Jewish Woman Cannot Stand Trial,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/17/world/europe/sarah-halimi-murder-trial.html,"PARIS — The highest court in France has ruled that the man who killed a Jewish woman in 2017 in an anti-Semitic frenzy cannot stand trial because he was in a state of acute mental delirium brought on by his consumption of cannabis.

Kobili Traoré, who has admitted to the killing and is in a psychiatric institution, beat Sarah Halimi, 65, before throwing her out the window of her Paris apartment to cries of “Allahu akbar,” or God is great, and “I killed the devil.”

Mr. Traoré, who was 27 at the time, had been troubled by Ms. Halimi’s mezuza, which “amplified the frantic outburst of hate,” according to one psychiatric report.

The verdict, more than four years after the killing, ended judicial proceedings in France for the case. The verdict came after a lower-court ruling rejected a trial, and the Halimi family appealed. President Emmanuel Macron made an unusual personal intervention by calling for the case to have its day in court.

London - Asharq Al-Awsat

History buffs will be able to roam the ruins of Rome's ""Area Sacra,"" perhaps catching a glimpse of Julius Caesar's ghost, after the site becomes an open-air museum next year.

Work to adapt the Largo Argentina archaeological site containing the ruins of four Roman temples for tourists begins next month, Rome Mayor Virginia Raggi announced.

""With this work we'll begin entering into the area and... walk among the vestiges of our history. Meanwhile, people can observe the site from its surrounding without stepping in it, because it's located few meters under the ground surface,"" she said at a press conference, AFP reported.

Julius Caesar is believed to have been stabbed in the Curia Pompei, a Senate building, part of whose limestone foundation is still visible.

But visitors are more likely to spot an apparition of the four-legged kind – namely, a cat.

The ruins are the domain of a colony of hundreds of rescued cats, fed, sterilized and cared for by a private non-profit shelter, who scamper through the site, lounging atop truncated marble pillars or posing for tourist photos – altogether unimpressed by the historical significance of their vast litterbox.

The temples, which date to between the third and second centuries B.C., include a circular monument to the goddess of Fortune, whose colossal marble head now sits in Rome's Centrale Montemartini museum.

They were uncovered as recently as 1926 in an urban planning project when demolished medieval houses revealed ancient Roman ruins underneath.",267,1668,12,68

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told Breakfast she was looking forward to seeing family and friends reunited as the transtasman bubble opens today.

Today 2000 New Zealanders would head off shore and 3000 would arrive in the country.

""That's really positive for us as we really want the inward flow to stimulate the economy.""

Ardern expected family and friends would be the first to make the most of the new bubble rules but that tourism would follow after.

From July to September New Zealand was expecting an influx of Aussies arriving in the South Island for skiing and expected Australian tourism to back to 80 per cent by the beginning of 2022.

Ardern thanked Kiwis for following the rules and making the ""unique"" arrangement between Australia and New Zealand possible.

While New Zealand was still focussed in opening up quarantine travel to the Cook Islands in May, she said there were ways to mitigate and concerns New Zealand had if for example Australia opened up its bubble to Singapore.

A date for the Cook Islands travel bubble had yet to be set and the Cook Islands were currently setting up and training staff around its PCR testing as this was needed before it commenced, she said.

Ardern said Singapore and Fiji were also keen to join New Zealand's travel bubble, but New Zealand would be a ""bit more cautious"" before going to Singapore.

She told RNZ it was a big day for New Zealand, but warned there would be ""ups and downs"" in the travel free the quarantine-free arrangement.

If New Zealand was worried about Australia opening up to Singapore then it could require anyone who had travelled outside Australia to stay in Australia for a period of time before travelling to New Zealand.

""Our base line to get as many NZers vaccinated before opening up to high-risk countries.""

While early research showed the chances of passing on Covid-19 once vaccinated was low, Ardern said there still needs to be more data to confirm that.

Ardern told the AM Show they would stop flights if they were concerned about a case not having an origin.

Ardern said she would love to sit in a terminal and watch the arrivals hall and see people be re-united. A flight from Australia was due to arrive in Auckland at 11am and another touches down in Wellington at 1pm.

She expected Australians would head over because New Zealand was a safe option and they had nowhere else to go.

She said beyond Cook Islands, Niue and possibly Fiji there were no plans for New Zealand to open up its borders to anywhere else.

New Zealand made its own decisions and would not necessarily open up to the same places as Australia.

Later this morning the government would address the issue with inequity where some critical and essential workers have been allowed to bring families while those who arrived earlier on were not.

The temporary suspension for those travelling from India was in place and Ardern said it was still on track to be lifted at the end of the month as it couldn't render New Zealand citizens stateless.

""Covid is rampant there right now. This is home for many of those travellers.""

""We're heading out!"" a delighted Angus Crampton declared at Wellington Airport before catching a flight to Sydney to see his family.

Sydney-based Rowan Heath will see her 85-year-old mother Heather in Auckland today, one of many tearful reunions as quarantine-free flights finally begin between New Zealand and Australia.

Heath, a 58-year-old teacher from Manly, will be one of the first Australians to take advantage of the transtasman travel bubble opening when she lands about 4.30pm.

About 400 quarantine-free flights per week will arrive and depart Auckland Airport on transtasman routes operated by Air New Zealand, Jetstar and Qantas by the end of April - a stark contrast to the 36 flights to and from Australia in the first week of April.

With her two brothers also in Australia, Heath spoke to the Herald about how hard the separation from her beloved mother had been.

""At the beginning, she was very, very teary saying, 'I'm never going to see you again', and we were like, 'No it's okay', but at 85 you just don't know,"" she said.

""It has been awful, but thank goodness for digital technology because otherwise it would have been absolutely horrendous.""

Heath expressed her gratitude for how New Zealand handled the Covid-19 pandemic.

""I've been really happy knowing that [mum] has been there, knowing that she's safe.""

More than 5000 Air New Zealand passengers are booked to travel between the two countries on Monday aboard 30 flights between Brisbane, Melbourne, Gold Coast, Perth, Sydney, and Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.

The first flight is due to take off just after 7.30am. Auckland Airport chief executive Adrian Littlewood said it's an important day that has taken a long time to get to.

""It's great to see Tasman going again, something that used to be about as uneventful as going to the supermarket, so it's certainly an exciting thing to get back to normal.""

He said the transtasman bubble has taken longer than anticipated. ""I think the path has been a bit unclear as we've all lived through the realities of Covid, and there's no straight-shot out of it either, there's always risks of things changing as we look ahead.

""The tourism industry and all travellers will be waiting to see how people feel about travelling again internationally, but I think it will gradually come back.""

Littlewood told Newstalk ZB's Mike Yardley there were 32 return flights scheduled today. Last week there were 36 flights to Australia across the entire week.

""We've got a range of ports across Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, as well as Gold Coast coming in. Later this week we'll have Hobart for the first time. So all up, nine ports across Australia.""

Littlewood said Australia was Auckland Airport's biggest market and the Tasman connection was critical to the bottom line.

""It's major for us, and for the tourism industry. Transtasman was about 40 percent of our international business, so to get that back really is the next step in the slow recovery of our business.""

Duty free shops would slowly be reopening at the terminal, along with food and beverage outlets, but Littlewood said the others will take time as the passenger market recovers.

""You've got to remember these shops have been shut for over a year, they've de-stocked, they've let staff go, so to bring that back does take some time.""

He said discussions about a travel bubble with the Cook Islands were ongoing, with many touting ""summer in May"" as a target date, but that was a decision for the Government.

Littlewood says he's completely confident in the airport's ability to accommodate quarantine-free travel, with multiple checks and audits from the organisations involved, but said there may be some bumps along the way.

""We're bringing a lot of staff back in and they'll have to get used to the new covid routines at the airport if they haven't been around for a year or so.""

Cheryl Mackie was departing from Wellington to go see her two daughters and grandson in Melbourne. ""It's been 13 months,"" she said. ""I never thought the day would come actually.

Dan and Jacqui Cottrell, with sons Charlie, Zachary and William, were off to Melbourne to see family who hadn't yet met their youngest boy. ""[We're] a bit emotional,"" Jacqui Cottrell said. ""They haven't met this little guy yet.""

Dan said they would be driving up through Victoria to Albury, near the border with New South Wales.

""Jacqui is there for six weeks. I've got 10 days, I've got to get back to work.""

Air New Zealand chief executive Greg Foran said he relished the ability to bring whānau together again.

""We're humbled to be part of these reunions and reconnecting people who have missed out on so much over the last year.""

He anticipated the national carrier would operate more than 300 flights per week during the July school holidays.

Customers should plan to check-in at least three hours prior to departure on transtasman flights. Masks are required on board and in the airports.

The Australian Travel Declaration must be completed at least 72 hours before departure, along with any state declarations. More details can be found at airnz.click/QFT2AU.

Auckland Airport chief executive Adrian Littlewood expected potential travellers to be cautious at first, as confidence in the bubble grew.

""We saw it unfold in the domestic market, where passenger numbers have gradually recovered since New Zealand began moving out of lockdown nearly a year ago.""

From Wellington this week, there will be 27 return flights to Australia, increasing to about 40 per week by the end of May. Pre-Covid, Australia and the Cook Islands accounted for 66 per cent of Wellington Airport's international travel.

Tourism New Zealand is predicting Australian travellers could bring in at least $1b by the end of the year.

In 2019, Australian visitors accounted for 19 per cent of the total international tourism market spend in Auckland with a value of about $933m.

Money was far from many travellers' minds on Monday morning however, as excited passengers checked in at airports.

Rara Akariri was at Auckland Airport, headed for Melbourne to see her daughter and five grandchildren, who are aged between 7 and 14. She hasn't seen them for two years.

Akariri said she was ""over the moon"" to hear about the transtasman bubble and expects it will be a tearful reunion on the other side when she arrives.

In a joint statement, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the start of two-way quarantine-free travel reflected the sustained efforts of both countries in managing the virus.

Morrison called today's milestone a ""win-win"" for Australians and New Zealanders.

""Both countries have done a remarkable job in protecting our communities from Covid and two-way flights are an important step in our road out.""

Ardern said it was ""truly exciting"" to start quarantine-free travel with Australia.

""Be it returning family, friends or holiday makers, New Zealand says welcome and enjoy yourself.

""The bubble marks a significant step in both countries' reconnection with the world and it's one we should all take a moment to be very proud of.""

The Tasman leaders said in the statement that Australia and New Zealand were exploring opportunities to expand quarantine-free travel to other countries in the Pacific when it is safe to do so.

Auckland mayor Phil Goff welcomed the bubble's anticipated boost to local business, as well as its social benefits.

""The lockdowns have been tough for everyone on both sides of the Tasman, and I know there will be many people who will be thrilled to be reunited with their loved ones, here and in Australia.

""It will give a much-needed boost to those involved in providing tourism, hospitality and retail services, whose jobs and businesses were badly affected by the border closure caused by the pandemic.""

NZ Herald travel writer Juliette Sivertsen is flying Auckland to Sydney and said the terminal is buzzing this morning.

""The airport is full of very very happy, excited travelers, most of them going off to see family they have not seen in a very long time.""

She said told Newstalk ZB's Mike Yardley most of the travel seems be people wanting to reconnect with friends and family, and many were keen to book the first flight out. ""There are a lot of people who have grandchildren or sisters or other family members or perhaps older parents or sick family members - they're all expecting it to be a very tearful reunion on the other side when they finally see their loved ones.

Sivertsen said going through security was very straight forward and not too busy with other flights heading out to Perth, Brisbane, Gold Coast and Melbourne this morning. She said there weren't any health checks, most people are wearing masks and passengers have to fill out a declaration before they land in Australia.

For those passengers keen to squeeze in some duty free shopping, Sivertsen said they were greeted by enthusiastic staff. ""They were all very excited to greet us as we were walking past, very energetic and happy to see passengers again.""",2603,15623,11,68

China's economic recovery quickened sharply in the first quarter to record growth of 18.3% from last year's deep coronavirus slump, propelled by stronger demand at home and abroad and continued government support for smaller firms.

But the brisk expansion, heavily skewed by the plunge in activity a year earlier, is expected to moderate later this year as the government turns its attention to reining in financial risks in overheating parts of the economy.

While the jump in gross domestic product (GDP) undershot the 19% forecast by economists in a Reuters poll, the official data showed it was the fastest growth since quarterly records began in 1992 and up from 6.5% in the fourth quarter last year.

""The upshot is that with the economy already above its pre-virus trend and policy support being withdrawn, China's post-COVID rebound is levelling off,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior china economist at Capital Economics. ""We expect quarter-on-quarter growth to remain modest during the rest of this year as the recent boom in construction and exports unwinds, pulling activity back towards trend.""

Aided by strict virus containment measures and emergency relief for businesses, the economy has recovered from a steep 6.8% slump in the first three months of 2020, when an outbreak of COVID-19 in the central city of Wuhan rapidly became a crippling pandemic that has killed about 3 million worldwide.

China's rebound has been led by exports as factories raced to fill overseas orders and more recently a steady pickup in consumption as shoppers returned to restaurants, malls and car dealerships. read more

Retail sales increased 34.2% year-on-year in March, beating a 28.0% gain expected by analysts and stronger than the 33.8% jump seen in the first two months of the year.

Other data, however, showed a moderation in expansion with quarter-on-quarter growth slowing to 0.6% in January-March from a revised 3.2% in the previous quarter, missing expectations for a 1.5% increase.

Factory output grew 14.1% year-on-year in March, slowing from a 35.1% surge in the January-February period and lagging a forecast 17.2% rise.

SLOWDOWN EXPECTED

National Bureau of Statistics spokeswoman Liu Aihua told a news conference on Friday while the economy started 2021 on a firm footing, the services sector and smaller firms still faced challenges, while consumer inflation was likely to remain moderate.

Data last week showed consumer prices rising at only a modest pace in March, even as factory gate inflation hit a near three-year high. read more

""Looking forward, the trend of normalisation may continue for the rest of the year, and domestic consumption is expected to be the major growth driver,"" said Chaoping Zhu, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management in Shanghai.

""In terms of policy response, the central bank and fiscal authorities are returning to a more neutral stance, although some selective measures might be continued in order to support the small and medium-sized enterprises.""

Li Wei, economist at Standard Chartered in Shanghai, expected second-quarter growth to slow to 7%.

FOCUS ON RISKS

The world's second-largest economy is expected to grow 8.6% in 2021, according to a Reuters poll, which would easily beat the government's 2021 annual growth target of above 6%. read more

China's GDP grew just 2.3% rise last year, its weakest expansion in 44 years but still making it the only major economy to avoid contraction as other industrial powers struggled with the pandemic hit.

With the economy back on a more solid footing, China's central bank is turning its focus to cooling credit growth to help contain financial risks.

However, it is treading cautiously to avoid derailing the recovery with policymakers vowing not to make any sudden policy shifts.

Authorities are especially concerned about financial risks involving the country's overheated property market and have asked banks to trim their loan books this year to guard against asset bubbles. read more

Separate data on Friday showed new home prices in China rising at the fastest pace in seven months in March, with gains spreading to more cities as red-hot demand defied government efforts to cool the market.

0,Energy planning: Israel looks to reduce gas emissions by 80% by 2050,https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/energy-planning-israel-looks-to-reduce-gas-emissions-by-80-percent-by-2050-665517,"Israel will look to reduce greenhouse -gas emissions by 80% by 2050 as part of its long-term plan to reduce pollution , the Energy Ministry said Sunday.

In addition, Israel has committed to close all coal plants by 2025, which would represent the fastest pace of coal reduction in the world, Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said in a presentation to journalists. The ministry’s new long-term strategic plan is the first of its sort for Israel with emission reduction targets and a road map of milestones and constraints in reaching its targets.

The long-term plan also aims to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions in the electricity sector by 75% to 85% by 2050, as well as improve its energy intensity index (energy consumption per unit of product) by 1.3% per year.

These targets are twice as ambitious as the commitments made by Israel at the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, something made possible by technological improvements since then, Steinitz said.

The strategic plan builds on new global trends such as hydrogen and natural-gas usage and the use of digital and smart grids, while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to frequent technological changes that happen in the energy sector, he said. In developing the plan, the Energy Ministry simulated about 2,000 possible scenarios for achieving the targets, it said.

The strategic plan takes into account Israel’s growing population density, which is among the highest in the world, with an increase in demand for electricity of about 2.8% per year. Other factors affecting Israel’s plan include the country’s large natural-gas reserves, the lack of available space to build solar-power fields, a lack of other renewable energy sources such as wind or hydroelectricity and Israel’s strength of innovation.

Among the strategic principles underlying the plan are: the need to transition to solar energy, with its massive storage needs; upgrading Israel’s electricity network with sustainable planning; transforming the way households use electricity (including replacing the use of cooking gas with the use of electricity); adoption of electric vehicles; continued investment in innovation; and adapting the natural-gas system to connect with Israel’s neighbors.

“We have set goals that are flexible, and we have not committed to using individual technologies,” Steinitz said. “We are looking ahead 30 years into the future, and we have no way of knowing how technology will advance by then. Imagine if we would have designed a technology plan 10 years ago. It would barely have taken natural gas into account.”",420,2873,12,68

REUTERS/Baz Ratner/File Photo

Eritrea told the United Nations Security Council on Friday that it has agreed to start withdrawing its troops from Ethiopia's Tigray region, acknowledging publicly for the first time the country's involvement in the conflict.

The admission in a letter to the 15-member council - and posted online by Eritrea's Ministry of Information - comes a day after U.N. aid chief Mark Lowcock said the world body had not seen any proof that Eritrean soldiers have withdrawn.

""As the looming grave threat has been largely thwarted, Eritrea and Ethiopia have agreed - at the highest levels - to embark on the withdrawal of Eritrean forces and the simultaneous redeployment of Ethiopian contingents along the international boundary,"" Eritrea's U.N. Ambassador Sophia Tesfamariam wrote.

Eritrean forces have been helping Ethiopian federal government troops fight Tigray's former ruling party in a conflict that began in November. However, until now Eritrea has repeatedly denied its forces are in the mountainous region.

Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed last month acknowledged the Eritrean presence and the United Nations and the United States have demanded that Eritrean troops withdraw from Tigray.

""Neither the U.N. nor any of the humanitarian agencies we work with have seen proof of Eritrean withdrawal,"" Lowcock told the Security Council on Thursday. ""We have, however, heard some reports of Eritrean soldiers now wearing Ethiopian Defense Force uniforms."" read more

The conflict has killed thousands of people and forced hundreds of thousands more from their homes in the region of 5 million.

Lowcock said there were ""widespread and corroborated reports of Eritrean culpability in massacres and killings."" Eritrean soldiers opened fire in an Ethiopian town on Monday, killing at least nine civilians and wounding more than a dozen others, a local government official told Reuters.

The Security Council has been briefed privately five times since the conflict began. According to Lowcock's briefing notes on Thursday, he told the body that sexual violence is being used as a weapon of war, the humanitarian crisis has deteriorated in the past month and people are now dying of hunger in Tigray.

""We heard false allegations of the 'the use of sexual violence and hunger as a weapon',"" Tesfamariam wrote on Friday. ""The allegations of rape and other crimes lodged against Eritrean soldiers is not just outrageous, but also a vicious attack on the culture and history of our people.""

She said the priority should be the delivery of aid to civilians in Tigray.

0,Scientists Develop New Implantable Device to Measure Tissues' Oxygen,https://english.aawsat.com/home/article/2923796/scientists-develop-new-implantable-device-measure-tissues-oxygen,"Cairo - Hazem Badr

Engineers at the University of California (UC) have created a tiny 4.5×3 mm device that can be implanted inside the body to provide real-time measurements of tissues' oxygen, and monitor the measurements wirelessly.

The device, which is powered by ultrasound waves, could help doctors monitor the health of transplanted organs or tissue and provide an early warning of potential transplant failure. The new development was announced in the journal Nature Biotechnology on April 14.

The technology also paves the way for the creation of a variety of miniaturized sensors that could track other key biochemical markers in the body, such as pH or carbon dioxide. These sensors could one day provide doctors with minimally invasive methods for monitoring the biochemistry inside functioning organs and tissues.

""It's very difficult to measure things deep inside the body. This new device can go very deep into tissue to take data from organs,"" said Michel Maharbiz, a UC professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences, in a report published on the university's website.

Oxygen is a key component to cells' ability to harness energy from the food that we eat, and nearly all tissues in the body require a steady supply in order to survive.

Most methods for measuring tissue oxygenation can only provide information about what is happening near the surface of the body. That is because these methods rely on electromagnetic waves, such as infrared light, which can only penetrate a few centimeters into skin or organ tissue. While there are types of magnetic resonance imaging that can provide information about deep tissue oxygenation, they require long scanning times, and so are unable to provide data in real time.

Maharbiz points out that this type of oxygen sensor differs from the pulse oximeters that are used to measure oxygen saturation in the blood.

While pulse oximeters measure the proportion of hemoglobin in the blood that is oxygenated, the new device is able to directly measure the amount of oxygen in tissue.",333,2059,9,68

Brussels has long been condemned for its use of fishing super trawlers in the world's oceans. They are enormous vessels and can be over 300-feet long, often staying at sea for weeks or months catching thousands of tonnes of fish. Their supersized nets - sometimes a mile long - result in bycatch that includes dolphins, porpoises and seals.

The EU was recently accused of operating a ""neocolonial"" hold over the Indian Ocean after it proposed insufficient measures to tackle overfishing of yellowfin tuna while simultaneously being the largest fisher of the ""near threatened"" species. And, according to The Daily Telegraph, EU super trawlers will continue to encroach on UK waters as the Government does not have the powers to implement a blanket ban. The vessels were a focus point of the new Netflix documentary, 'Seaspiracy', that shed light on much of the fishing industry's shady operations. This week, climate activist George Monbiot, and Terri Portmann, co-founder of Call for Fish, appeared on Sky News to discuss the impact the UK's fishing fleets had on the environment in the wake of Seaspiracy.

It was here that Ms Portmann - whose organisation aims to get more people eating British-sourced fish - outlined the ways in which UK fleets had tried to become sustainable despite the questionable practices of their European neighbours. She said: ""George knows well that the majority of the UK fishing fleet are small scale boats - we're talking smaller than 10 metres in length. ""These are not the type of horror pictures used in the film and nor represent some of the colourful claims that George is making. ""Actually, a lot of these coastal communities are working really hard to be sustainable. ""There's a project in Lyme Bay which is trialing vessel monitoring and has been for the last ten years, the technology is very difficult to put onto small vessels. ""But this work's ongoing - your film is 20 years too late, it represents in the UK a system and a process of fishing that was going on many years ago and for 20 years now there has been great advances in selectivity of gear, which is incredibly difficult in a mixed fishery. ""In the south-west we eat our bycatch; now admittedly it's not shark or turtles, but we should be supporting these small-scale fishermen, supporting the work they're doing to be more sustainable, to work with scientists, to find better ways of avoiding these things.""

Before this, however, Mr Monbiot was less than impressed by the efforts made so far, as he said: ""It's absolutely urgent that the small boats in particular are put on a sustainable footing. ""That means every one, all the boats, should be fitted with remote monitoring equipment so that fisheries inspectors can see what's going all the time, they're not fishing illegally, they're not fishing in the wrong places. ""We also need large, properly protected marine reserves where no fishing boats can go in, and we need to protect the small boats from the big boats, from the super trawlers which are taking so much, almost everything. ""The fishing industry is massively concentrated in the hands of a few extremely rich families. ""When we've sorted all that out I'd be happy to say to people, 'Ok, it's alright to start eating fish again.'"" DON'T MISS John Bercow's furious defence of 'victim' Meghan Markle [REPORT]

Mr Monbiot has previously described the bloc's impact on the living world as ""catastrophic"". One of the pieces of EU legislation he and other climate activists, including Greta Thunberg, have focused their attention on is the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). In a Twitter thread last month, he wrote: ""The perverse incentives it creates have destroyed hundreds of thousands of hectares of prime habitat."" Last month, Barrie Deas, chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, said that Brussels had a ""neocolonial"" relationship with the UK on fishing.

This was, he said, because the EU had exploited UK waters for decades, offering little in return. He told Express.co.uk: ""The EU's relationship with the UK is neocolonial because it's exploitative - it's artificially attached to a trade deal. ""It gives free access to the natural resources of another country for the benefit of the colonial power.

0,These animals went extinct in the wild. Scientists brought them back,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/16/world/animal-reintroduction-extinct-wild-c2e-hnk-spc-intl-scn/index.html,"All of them went extinct in the wild -- and all of them came back, thanks to reintroduction programs.

Conservation scientists use translocation and captive breeding to re-establish animal populations that have died out in the wild -- either entirely or in certain areas. Reintroducing extinct-in-the-wild animals to their native territories can be a double win: helping to restore degraded ecosystems, as well as increasing population numbers.

But setting a species loose in the wild is a precarious balancing act. Reintroductions often take years and involve multiple phases, says Natasha Robinson, an ecologist at the Australian National University who specializes in threatened wildlife.

One of the most iconic reintroduction success stories, Przewalski's horse went extinct in the wild in the 1960s, but were returned to the Mongolian steppe in 1992.

Before bringing back a species, conservationists have to evaluate the threat level -- both to and from the animal -- and the role it played in the ecosystem, says Robinson. In places where wild populations have died out more recently, there's a better chance of success, she says.

""The less time that has passed, the more likely that environment is the same as when the species went extinct,"" she says. ""But you still need to address the reason why it went extinct in that environment to begin with.""

Reintroduced animals can have a positive impact on the landscape, but how fast this happens depends on the type of animal and how damaged the environment is. Herbivores can make a significant change relatively quickly, says Robinson: for example, bandicoots, a small shrew-like marsupial, dig and redistribute flammable ""fuel loads"" like dry leaves which can reduce the risk of bushfires, as well as increasing soil turnover and improving seedling growth.

Hunted for its meat, hide and horns, the Arabian oryx disappeared from the wild in the 1970s but has since been reintroduced in Israel, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.

Predators tend to be reintroduced slowly and carefully. While they can be useful for managing pest species, conservationists have to ensure they don't overhunt or threaten other vulnerable animals, says Robinson.

2020 study highlighted species reintroduction as one of the most effective ways to save endangered animals. Without these projects, species such as Przewalski's horse and the Guam rail would almost certainly be extinct in the wild. The study estimates that conservation action between 1993 and 2020 saved up to 48 species of birds and mammals from extinction, and that the rate of extinction would have been three to four times higher, during that period, without those efforts.

0,Oil firm bosses’ pay ‘incentivises them to undermine climate action’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/15/oil-firm-ceos-pay-is-an-incentive-to-resist-climate-action-study-finds,"Lucrative pay and share options have created an incentive for oil company executives to resist climate action, according to a study that casts doubt on recent net-zero commitments by BP and Shell.

Compensation packages for CEOs, often in excess of $10m (£7.2m), are linked to continued extraction of fossil fuels, exploration of new fields and the promotion of strong market demand through advertising, lobbying and government subsidies, the report says.

The setup with executives runs counter to efforts around the world to keep global heating to 1.5-2C (2.7-3.6F) above pre-industrial levels.

Boardroom rewards also underpin a skewed corporate logic that is slowing the world’s path to decarbonisation, according to the study, which was exclusively shared with the Guardian before publication in the Energy Research and Social Science journal.

Richard Heede, of the Climate Accountability Institute in the US, a co-author of the paper, said the discovery showed that the need for changes in corporate structures was more urgent than consumer behaviour changes.

“We show that executives have personal ownership of tens or hundreds of thousands of shares, which creates an unacknowledged personal desire to explore, extract and sell fossil fuels,” Heede said. “That carbon mindset needs to be revised by realigning compensation towards success in lowering absolute emissions.”

The study tracks ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell and BP – four of the biggest “carbon major” oil companies – since 1990. This was around the time the global public heard the first high-profile warning about the dangers of burning fossil fuels.

Executives had been told of the threat many years earlier, but instead of working on a transition to cleaner, safer forms of energy, they ramped up production, played down risks and adopted public relations campaigns that misleadingly presented oil companies as part of the solution rather than the source of the problem.

Between 1990 and 2019 the four companies made a combined profit of about $2tn. A minuscule fraction of these funds has been invested in low-carbon energy.

ExxonMobil allocated 0.22% of its capital expenditure to low-carbon energy in the eight years until 2018. The share at Chevron was almost identical. Shell managed 1.3% and BP 2.3%. None were aligned with a 1.5C pathway, the report says.

Instead, the overwhelming bulk of the profits was either ploughed back into oil and gas extraction, invested in buying back shares, paid out in dividends to shareholders or used to lobby politicians, undermine climate science and pay for greenwashing advertisements.

In the US, lobbying expenditures for the four companies totalled $731m between 1998 and 2019. Their corporate political donations in the US, stretching back to 1990, were worth $59m.

As public pressure and scientific evidence strengthened, the big four moved through the gears, the study asserts. “Business as usual” (pretending no problem existed) in the 1980s became “incremental adaptation” (casting doubt on the science as an excuse to move slowly) in the 1990s and early 2000s, and has today turned into “partial diversification” (accepting the science, but moving gradually towards long-term goals).

Despite the change in tactics and public rhetoric, the long-term strategy was always the same: securing a social licence to extract oil and gas. All four companies plan to continue extracting fossil fuels after 2050.

The co-author of the paper, Dario Kenner of the University of Sussex, said Shell’s and BP’s recent announcement of a net-zero goal by 2050, and Exxon’s and Chevron’s endorsement of carbon pricing, should be seen as similar tactics.

Kenner said: “When BP, Shell and others talk of net zero, they are trying to stay part of the decision-making process. They want to be in charge of the transition as much as possible so they can slow it down – that is the whole point of trying to convince society to trust them.”

He added that comparisons of the targets set by individual companies were a distraction from the more important role the government should play.

“It can’t be just about what Shell is doing or BP. It must be industry-wide. And should be about acting on climate science and phasing out oil and gas in line with a 1.5C target.” He said executive fortunes depended, however, on continuing production and sales.

The study examines the high levels of boardroom pay that motivate individuals to continue corporate practices that are destabilising the climate.

At least seven executives received more than $10m in 2018, the most recent year covered by the study. Shell’s CEO, Ben van Beurden, was the top earner with $23,069,040.

Stock options make up a growing share of that compensation, which the study authors say encourages executives to use profits for share buybacks rather than investment in renewable energy.

Another dataset ranks the carbon weight of each senior executive’s shareholdings, based on the amount of oil and gas the company has pumped out of the ground in a given year. In 2018, John Watson, the CEO of Chevron, topped this list with a personal emissions share of more than 600,000 tonnes, which is more than 100,000 times that of the average UK citizen.

“This paper shines a light on incentives in corporations that may not align with their public commitments to get to net zero by 2050,” Heede said. “Companies need to review compensation and align it with low-carbon reinvestment targets.”

He acknowledged that recent announcements by Shell and BP go further than US companies in investment in renewables and pay structures, but said transition plans across the industry needed to give detail on absolute emissions reduction targets, and reinvestment plans, and firms should be more transparent and less reliant on tree-planting offsets.

Corporate lobbying and advertising should switch, Heede said, from greenwashing to frank recognition of the dangers of fossil fuels and promotion of clean alternatives.

The paper suggests they will need a push from outside. It concludes that oil and gas companies are ill-structured for decarbonisation at the speed and scale demanded by climate science. “This raises the need for further external pressure, in particular by governments.”

In the past two years, there have been some changes, though the pace varies from company to company. Shell told the Guardian it had introduced an energy transition performance metric that was now worth 20% of its long-term incentive plan. “We were the first major energy company to connect executive pay to the energy transition in this way,” a spokesperson said. This February, Shell said the pay of more than 16,500 staff was now linked to a set of short- and long-term decarbonisation targets. The company said there was no longer a link between production volumes and executive renumeration.

Chevron said the conclusions of the study were inaccurate and misleading. “Executive compensation is determined by the independent directors of the board, advised by an independent compensation consultant. Our programme design aligns with shareholder interests and supports the company’s focus on ‘higher returns, lower carbon’. Energy transition performance measures are directly tied to the compensation of our executives and most of our employees in the company’s annual bonus programme,” a spokesperson said. The company said it was working to help the world achieve lower-carbon energy by increasing the use of renewables and offsets and investing in low-carbon technologies.



ExxonMobil said its compensation programme was designed to incentivise actions that create sustainable shareholder value based on careful consideration of current and future risks, such as those related to climate change. In a statement, it said executive pay was aligned with the results of their decisions and the returns of shareholders over the long term.



The authors of the new report said Shell, and to a lesser degree BP, had increased low-carbon investments, but its measures were still insufficient to meet the 1.5C target without significant emissions overshoot. The US firms, they said, were much further behind in responding to the risks. The key was an industry-wide approach in line with global climate governance rather than voluntary commitments that could be rolled back later, as has happened in the past, the authors of the report said.



“Our study clearly shows why it is time to stop spending so much time being distracted by what these companies promise,” Kenner said. “We should instead be discussing more the role of policymakers.”

BP said its remuneration policy supports the company’s goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 of earlier in line with Paris targets. A spokesman said this will involve the most extensive transformation in BP’s history. “By 2030, the strategy aims to increase our investment in low carbon energy to $5 billion a year, to have developed 50GW of renewable generating capacity, and to have reduced BP’s upstream oil and gas production by 40%.”",1435,9058,10,68

The Chinese flights came a day after the US secretary of state warned Beijing that Washington was committed to the defense of the democratic, self-governed island, which China considers part of its sovereign territory.

The 25 planes dispatched by China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) forces included 14 J-16 fighter jets, four J-10 fighter jets, four H-6K bombers, two anti-submarine warfare planes and an airborne early warning and control plane, according to Taiwan's Defense Ministry.

A Chinese J-16 fighter jet is seen in this undated image supplied by Taiwan's Defense Ministry.

Taiwan responded by scrambling combat aircraft, alerting missile defense systems and issuing radio warnings to the Chinese planes that they had entered the southwestern corner of the island's self-declared air defense identification zone (ADIZ), a ministry statement said.

A graphic supplied by the ministry showed flight tracks for the Chinese aircraft coming from and returning toward the Chinese mainland, making 180-degree turns between the main Taiwanese island and Pratas Island, southeast of Hong Kong.

A suspected poacher was killed by a herd of breeding elephants that he encountered while fleeing from park rangers, according to South African officials.

Three people attempted to run away after they were spotted by rangers at the Kruger National Park, one of Africa's largest game reserves, on Saturday, South African National Parks officials said.

After one of the suspects was captured, he told park rangers the group had run into a herd of elephants, adding that he was not sure if his alleged accomplice had managed to escape, officials said.

Rangers later discovered the man ""badly trampled"" and dead from his injuries.

Investigators say they are still searching for the third suspect, who continued to flee after he suffered an injury to the eye.

The men are suspected of attempting to poach rhinos, according to officials. A rifle and axe were recovered amid the investigation, officials said.

""The campaign against poaching is the responsibility of all us; it threatens many livelihoods, destroys families and takes much-needed resources to fight crime, which could be used for creating jobs and development,"" Gareth Coleman, managing executive of Kruger National Park, said in a statement.

0,Suga-arrives-in-Washington-for-talks-with-Biden-China-topping-agenda,https://japantoday.com/category/politics/Suga-arrives-in-Washington-for-talks-with-Biden-China-topping-agenda,"By MARI YAMAGUCHI and AAMER MADHANI

Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga arrived in Washington on Thursday for talks with U.S. President Joe Biden meant to show the strength of the two nations' security alliance at a time when both are concerned with China’s growing economic and military clout.

Friday's talks will be Biden's first face-to-face meeting with a foreign leader since he took office, and they follow four years of uncertainty for the Japan-U.S. alliance under former President Donald Trump’s administration.

Japan's Foreign Ministry said Suga hopes to reaffirm the alliance's “strong bond” and discuss a multinational effort to defend democratic values and counter China’s growing global influence and disputed territorial claims.

“I hope to develop a relationship of trust with President Biden and further strengthen the Japan-U.S. alliance bound by the universal values of freedom, democracy, human rights and rule of law,” Suga told reporters Thursday before heading to Tokyo's Haneda International Airport.

Suga said he and Biden will ""compare and adjust our policies, and we will demonstrate to the rest of the world the leadership of Japan and the United States toward achieving a free and open Indo-Pacific region.”

Japanese officials said Biden and Suga are expected to discuss how to manage the peace and stability of regional seas, including the Taiwan Strait, where tensions are rising. The two leaders are also expected to discuss the human rights situation in Hong Kong and China's northwestern Xinjiang region.

Japan has taken a milder approach to allegations of Chinese human rights violations and has not joined the United States and European nations in imposing sanctions. Gen Nakatani, a ruling party lawmaker and former defense minister, is leading a nonpartisan parliamentary group calling for Suga's government to take tougher steps, including sanctions, to be in line with Western democracies, but a decision has not been made.

Japan considers China’s growing military activity in the region as well as its broad territorial claims to be a security threat. Japan is itself locked in dispute with China over Beijing’s claim to the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands, called Diaoyu in China, in the East China Sea.

Elsewhere Tokyo has watched with concern as China has built military installations on disputed territory it claims in the South China Sea.

The U.S., meanwhile, has butted heads with China over numerous issues, including the coronavirus pandemic, human rights, Chinese policy in Hong Kong, Xinjaing and Tibet and trade. To erode China’s claims on the South China Sea, U.S. ships regularly conduct so-called “freedom of navigation” operations, sailing into international waters that China is trying to claim as its own.

China denies it is expansionist and says it is only defending its territorial rights. It says that the largest threat to regional peace and stability is the U.S.

Also on the cards for the talks between Biden and Suga are the ongoing fight against the pandemic, COVID-19 vaccine cooperation to support developing countries, establishing less China-reliant supply chains and climate change, Japanese officials said.

Suga, who has set a goal of achieving a carbon neutral society by 2050, said he hoped to closely cooperate with Biden to jointly lead international efforts to tackle the issue when the U.S. leader hosts a virtual climate change summit just a week after their meeting.

The controversial YouTube star and Lucas were driving in Natrona County when the Rolls Royce they were in hit black ice and flipped over three times.

A representative posted a picture of Star in a hospital gown, laying in a bed with a neck brace on, from his official Twitter account.

“A few hours ago Jeffree and Daniel were in a severe car accident and the car flipped 3 times after hitting black ice,” the tweet stated.

“We will update you all when the doctor gives us more info. So thankful they are both alive.”

Star has now posted an update from his social media accounts, calling the incident “one of the scariest moments” of his life.

“This morning was one of the scariest moments of our entire lives. I’m so grateful to be here still. I’m in excruciating pain because part of my back is broken and I have vertebrae fractures on my spine. My doctor said it will take a few months but I should make a full recovery,” he wrote.

“My best friend Daniel has internal injuries and because he has survived colon cancer three times, he’s having complications with his organs and they’re monitoring him 24/7. We’ll know more soon. Thank you to every single person checking on us.”

The Wyoming Highway Patrol said Mr Star’s vehicle was heading northbound on Hat Six Road when it crashed and the men are now being treated at Wyoming Medical Center.

“There was slush on the roadway up in that area,” said WHP Sergeant Jeremy Beck.

Police confirmed that Mr Star was driving the car and that both he and Mr Lucas had been wearing seatbelts.

An investigation into the crash is ongoing.

Star, whose real name is Jeffrey Lynn Steininger, is originally from Orange County, California, but last year bought a 70-acre ranch near Casper, Wyoming.

0,China ramps up vaccination drive with free eggs for those getting jab,https://www.euronews.com/2021/04/16/china-ramps-up-vaccination-drive-with-free-eggs-for-those-getting-jab?utm_source=flipboard.com&amp;utm_campaign=feeds_news&amp;utm_medium=referral,"China's success at controlling the coronavirus outbreak has resulted in a population that has seemed almost reluctant to get vaccinated.

The country is accelerating its inoculation campaign by offering incentives — free eggs, shop coupons and discounts on groceries and merchandise — to those getting a jab.

After a slow start, China is now giving millions of vaccines a day. A top government doctor, Zhong Nanshan, announced a June goal of vaccinating 560 million of the country’s 1.4 billion people.

The challenge lies partly in the sheer scale of the effort and the need to convince a population that currently feels safe from infections.

When patients first showed up at hospitals in Wuhan in late 2019 with fevers, coughs and breathing difficulties, the government locked down the city and others in Hubei province for more than two months starting in January 2020. Wuhan later became known as the epicentre of the outbreak.

Since then, China has controlled the virus through stringent border controls and quick lockdowns whenever new outbreaks crop up.

People can dine out in restaurants and the risk of infection is low, so many don't seem to be in a hurry to get the vaccine.

But China also wants to open up as the world seeks to return to pre-pandemic normalcy and Beijing readies to welcome tens of thousands of visitors as host of the Winter Olympics in February 2022.

For now, in major cities like Shanghai and Beijing, the government has relied mostly on sustained messaging and freebies to convince people to get vaccinated.

Shopping malls have offered points at stores or coupons. A temple in Beijing offered free entry to anyone showing proof of vaccination. Shanghai is using buses in its campaign to set up mobile vaccination points.

And then there are the free eggs. “Good news. Starting from today, residents 60-years-old and above who have got their first shot are eligible for five ‘jin’ (2.5 kilograms or 5 1/2 pounds) of eggs. First come, first served,” said a poster by a city-run health centre in Beijing.

Some people have expressed doubts about how good the existing vaccines are given how quickly they were developed.

The five vaccines currently being used in China have an efficacy range of 50.7% to 79.3%, based on what the companies that developed them have said.

But the effectiveness of a Sinovac vaccine at preventing symptomatic infections was found to be as low as 50.4% by researchers in Brazil, near the 50% threshold at which health experts say a vaccine is useful. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been found to be 97% effective.

`The threshold needed for regulatory approval by the World Health Organization (WHO) is also 50%.

Herd immunity only occurs when enough of the population has immunity, either from vaccinations or past infection, to stop the uncontrolled spread of an infectious disease.

China may need to vaccinate at least 1 billion people to achieve that, said Wang Huaqing, a top immunology official with China’s Center for Disease Control, in an interview with state media this week.

As of early April, roughly 34 million people had received two shots and about 65 million got one dose.

Gao Fu, the head of the CDC, said last weekend that China is considering various strategies such as mixing different vaccines to try to increase effectiveness. Outside experts say China could eventually deploy other, more effective vaccines, such as the Pfizer or Moderna shots.

Chinese drugmaker Fosun Pharmaceutical Group has partnered with Germany's BioNTech to sell the Pfizer vaccine in China. However, it has only been approved in Hong Kong and Macao, special territories in China with their own regulatory agencies. A clinical trial for mainland approval is underway.

Vaccination is supposed to be voluntary, but overzealous efforts by some local governments and companies prompted health officials to issue a warning this week against forced vaccinations.

A hospital in Danzhou on the southern island province of Hainan issued an apology after it issued a notice to staff saying: “Those who are not vaccinated could be fired.”

In Zhejiang province, an April 2 announcement said all government departments, Communist Party cadres and people working in universities would be required to take the lead in getting shots.

The national government also required vaccination for all residents in Ruili, a border town with Myanmar, because of a recent outbreak.",721,4426,12,69

Saturday is the first day of the traditional New Year in Myanmar and the last day of a five-day holiday that is usually celebrated with visits to Buddhist temples and rowdy water throwing and partying in the streets.

Pro-democracy activists called for the cancellation of the festivities this year and instead for people to focus on a campaign to restore democracy after the military's ouster of the elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.

Suu Kyi is among 3,141 people arrested in connection with the coup, according to a tally by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) activist group.

""These detainees are mostly from before Feb. 1 but there are also some who were imprisoned after,"" Prisons Department spokesman Kyaw Tun Oo told Reuters by telephone.

Asked if any of those being freed might have been detained in connection with the protests against military rule, he said he did not have details of the amnesties.

While the military was freeing the thousands of prisoners, it was also seeking 832 people on warrants in connection with the protests, the AAPP said.

Among them are 200 people, including several internet celebrities, actors and singers who have spoken out against the coup, wanted on a charge of encouraging dissent in the armed forces, which can carry a three-year jail term.

Two of them, the married couple of film director Christina Kyi and actor Zenn Kyi, were detained at the airport in the main city of Yangon on Saturday as they were trying to leave on a flight to Bangkok, the Irrawaddy news site reported.

A spokesman for the junta did not answer calls seeking comment.

ROUGH ROAD

Myanmar has been in upheaval since the coup, which the military defended with accusations of fraud in a November election won by Suu Kyi's party, though the election commission dismissed the objections.

The ousted government had held power for the first five years of civilian rule since nearly half a century of army control ended.

People infuriated by the return of military rule have taken to the streets day after day to demand the restoration of democracy, defying crackdowns by the security forces in which 728 people have been killed, according to the AAPP's latest figures.

Political leaders, including ousted members of parliament, announced the formation of a National Unity Government (NUG) on Friday including Suu Kyi and leaders of the anti-coup protests and ethnic minorities.

The NUG says it is the legitimate political authority and has called for international recognition.

The junta has yet to comment on the unity government but has said it will hold a new election within two years and hand power to the winner.

The NUG's vice president, Duwal Sheila, an ethnic Kachin lawyer, said in a New Year message the road to replacing military rule with democracy would be rough.

""We pledge to continue working with all ethnic peoples to overthrow the military dictatorship and establish a new federal democracy,"" he said.

Protesters took to the streets in the second city of Mandalay in support of the NUG, media reported.

The coup has also triggered clashes between the army and ethnic minority insurgent groups in the north and east.

On Saturday, fighters from the Kachin Independence Army attacked an air base in the north with rockets or shells, one of which hit a nearby village house, injuring one person, the Mizzima news agency reported.

Suu Kyi faces various charges including violating an official secrets act that could see her jailed for 14 years. Her lawyers dismiss the charges.

0,First-ever human-monkey hybrid created in ‘chimera’ embryo experiment,http://globalnews.ca/news/7760167/human-monkey-chimera-embryo-hybrid/,"Scientists have successfully combined human and monkey cells into a single living, growing embryo, in a major — and ethically complex — breakthrough for organ transplant research.

But don’t worry: This isn’t the real-world prequel to a planet of the semi-human apes. At least, not yet.

An international team of researchers added human stem cells to macaque monkey embryos and watched as they survived and multiplied as one, according to the findings published Thursday in the journal Cell. The scientists effectively created genetic chimeras — a term borrowed from the mythical monster to describe one organism with genes from multiple individuals.

Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, a professor at the Salk Institute and co-author on the study, insists that this is not about creating a full-grown chimera with human and animal traits.

“Our goal is not to generate any new organism, any monster,” he told NPR. “And we are not doing anything like that. We are trying to understand how cells from different organisms communicate with one another.”

He adds that the discovery could lead to better understanding of human biology and diseases, as well as more effective human chimeras involving less similar species. That, perhaps, could lead to animals being used to grow organs for human transplant.

Belmonte and his team injected 25 human stem cells into macaque embryos taken six days after fertilization. Human cells were found growing inside 132 of the embryos after one day, and 103 chimeras were still alive after Day 10. Nearly all had died by Day 19, and the rest were destroyed on Day 20.

“On average we observed around 4 per cent of human cells in the monkey epiblast,” co-author Dr. Jun Wu, at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, told The Guardian.

“We demonstrated that the human stem cells survived and generated additional cells, as would happen normally as primate embryos develop and form the layers of cells that eventually lead to all of an animal’s organs,” Belmonte said.

The successful experiment was a major step forward for Belmonte, who has studied this area for decades and who has previously tried to combine human and pig cells in the same manner.

The breakthrough is part of a broader effort to see if animals can be used to grow human organs for transplant patients — a goal that others have also chased by trying to splice human DNA into pigs, mice and sheep. Chinese researchers have also created pig-monkey chimeras with the same end goal in mind.

Belmonte says these revelations about cell communication will hopefully make it easier to create chimeras out of more genetically distant species, such as humans and pigs, in the future.

Of course, the breakthrough also opens up a slew of difficult ethical questions.

“My first question is: Why?” Kirstin Matthews, a fellow for science and technology at Rice University’s Baker Institute, told NPR. “I think the public is going to be concerned, and I am as well, that we’re just pushing forward with science without having a proper conversation about what we should or should not do.”

Professor Julian Savulescu, the director of the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics and co-director of the Wellcome Centre for Ethics and Humanities at the University of Oxford, also raised concerns about this discovery becoming a slippery slope.

“These embryos were destroyed at 20 days of development, but it is only a matter of time before human-nonhuman chimeras are successfully developed, perhaps as a source of organs for humans,” he told The Guardian.

He added that any fully-grown chimera involving human cells would need to be thoroughly assessed to see what its mental capacity is like, especially if it’s to be used for organ transplants.

“What looks like a nonhuman animal may mentally be close to a human,” he said. “We will need new ways to understand animals, their mental lives and relationships before they are used for human benefit.”

The embryos in this experiment had not progressed to the point where they were forming body parts or brain cells.

Belmonte says the next step is to better understand the communication pathways between cells, and to determine which ones are critical for an embryo’s development.

He adds that he and his team performed “ethical consultations and reviews” before they made their chimeras, with help from unaffiliated bioethicists.

0,Five people killed as police fire at protesting workers in Bangladesh,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/17/five-people-killed-as-police-fire-at-protesting-workers-in-bangladesh,"At least five people were killed and dozens injured in Bangladesh after police opened fire on a crowd of workers protesting to demand unpaid wages and a pay rise at a Chinese-backed power plant, officials and police said.

Police opened fire after about 2,000 of the protesters began hurling bricks and stones at officers at the construction site of the coal-fired plant in the south-eastern city of Chittagong, local police official Azizul Islam told Reuters.

Four protesters died at the scene and another died in hospital, he said.

“We’re trying to control the situation,” Islam said, adding that at least six police officers were among those injured.

The workers attacked and set fire to several structures at the 1,320-megawatt power plant, located 265 km (165 miles) south-east of the capital, Dhaka, he added.

Local government official Saiduzzaman Chowdhury said the workers were protesting over unpaid wages and to press demands for a pay rise and reduced hours during the holy month of Ramadan, which started this week, when Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset.

Several of the injured workers had gunshot wounds and were taken to a hospital in Chittagong, he said, adding that the five people who were killed had all been shot.

The $2.4bn power plant is a major source of foreign investment into Bangladesh, and one of a series of projects that Beijing is pushing to cultivate closer ties with Dhaka.

In 2016, China’s SEPCOIII Electric Power Construction signed a deal with S Alam group, a Bangladeshi conglomerate responsible for construction work at the site.

During that year, four protesters opposed to its construction were killed when police opened fire during clashes between villagers who were demonstrating both for and against the project.",286,1765,11,69

I also call on Western govts who have outlawed any negative comment on the holocaust to use the same standards to penalise those deliberately spreading their message of hate against Muslims by abusing our Prophet PBUH. — Imran Khan (@ImranKhanPTI) April 17, 2021

The recent controversy began when the far-right Pakistan Islamist supremacist political party Tehreek-e-Labbaik began protests in Pakistan against France, which has told its citizens to flee the South Asian Islamic Republic.

In a cycle that has now become common under many far-right Islamist regimes, whenever an extremist group claims it is “offended” by a Western country, it lashes out at Jews and the Holocaust.In the latest incident, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan compared “negative comments on the Holocaust” to “abuse of our Prophet” and called on Western countries to make criticism of the Prophet illegal. Khan doesn’t actually condemn Holocaust denial; he has met with leading Holocaust denier Mahathir Mohamad, the former prime minister of Malaysia.The attacks on France are entirely invented and are commonly used in Muslim countries that have far-right governments to encourage extremism. For instance, Turkey also attacked France last year, claiming it had “insulted the Prophet,” which led to several terrorist attacks in France.Last October, a student in a French school lied to her classmates , claiming a teacher had “insulted” Islam. The teacher was beheaded.In response to the beheading, rather than condemn the attack, Turkey mobilized its extremists to attack France. Anti-French riots and protests occurred around the Muslim world under the entirely false claim that the “Prophet had been insulted.”To get back at France, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan slammed the Holocaust last year. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah also used Holocaust denial last year to get back at France for not being “sensitive” to religious feelings. France had prosecuted “philosopher Roger Garaudy, who wrote a book questioning the myths of the so-called Holocaust,” he said.“Muslims have a right to be angry and to kill millions of French people,” said Malaysia’s Mahathir, a former guest at Oxford, Cambridge and Columbia University, where his denials and antisemitic comments have been indulged.Iran’s regime has also pushed Holocaust denial to get back at Europe for insults to Muslims. In 2006, it hosted a Holocaust-denial cartoon contest in revenge for cartoons against Islam in Denmark.Now the cycle has begun again. Every time far-right Islamists are angry at Europe for insults, it is the Holocaust that has to be brought up. Most far-right Islamist groups, rooted in the Muslim Brotherhood, openly deny the Holocaust.Imran Khan, a former cricket champion who was once married to a woman who was part Jewish, didn’t actually acknowledge Holocaust denial in his tweet. He wrote: “I also call on Western govts who have outlawed any negative comment on the holocaust to use the same standards to penalise those deliberately spreading their message of hate against Muslims by abusing our Prophet PBUH [peace be upon him].”The tone of his tweet, like comments by other far-right Islamist leaders, is to try to minimize the Holocaust – as he says, “negative comments about the Holocaust” – to get back at European governments. European countries and their collaborators carried out the Holocaust; the same countries today are the ones where there are sometimes cartoons offensive to Muslims.It is unclear why the Islamist far Right, which denies the Holocaust at home, always seeks to bring it up whenever they are offended by the same Western countries where the Holocaust took place.These countries, such as Pakistan, outlaw blasphemy at home but do not outlaw or ban Holocaust denial. They claim it is hypocritical of some European countries that ban Holocaust denial to not ban offensive comments about Muslims.However, they don’t argue that they should also ban Holocaust denial in Iran, Turkey, Pakistan and Malaysia. Rather, they claim Holocaust denial is “free speech” at home.Malaysia’s former leader, for instance, was invited to many leading Western universities to push Holocaust denial. “Why is it I can’t say something against the Jews?” he asked at Columbia University. He wanted his “free speech” to attack Jews and the Holocaust, but then he complains about “free speech” in places like France that enables cartoons insulting the Prophet.None of the leaders, including Khan, Mahathir, Erdogan and Ahmadinejad, argued that Holocaust denial should be banned in their countries as well as blasphemy. Instead, their argument is that blasphemy should be banned in Europe and that they should have a right to free speech denying the Holocaust.In general, the cycle of these groups is to encourage Holocaust denial the more they see offensive comments against Islam in Europe. This doesn’t hurt the feelings of most people in Europe. Rather, it targets Jews. This is because these groups are systemically anti-Jewish, and their interest is not to hurt the feelings of Europeans in revenge for hurt feelings regarding their faith, but rather to justify hating Jews as a response.Pakistan’s Khan claimed that extremists in Europe had indulged in Islamophobia and racist slurs “to hurt and cause pain to 1.3 billion Muslims.” The response: Attack the Holocaust, which extremists in Europe did to six million Jews.How reducing respect for the Holocaust gets back at France or Europeans, where Holocaust denial originated, is unclear.None of the far-right Muslim leaders have ever acknowledged the Holocaust and given respect to Jews, Jewish suffering or the genocide of Jews. They use hatred of Jews to respond to European insults against Islam.Pakistan claims that insults to Islam are tantamount to Holocaust denial, but it doesn’t ban Holocaust denial. The only time Khan has mentioned the Holocaust is to get back at France and inflame his base at home, not to acknowledge it.",952,6270,8,69

Sputnik/Alexei Druzhinin/Kremlin via REUTERS

Russia on Friday asked 10 U.S. diplomats to leave the country in retaliation for Washington's expulsion of the same number of Russian diplomats over alleged malign activity and suggested the U.S. ambassador return home for consultations.

The measures, part of a broader retaliatory package, were approved by President Vladimir Putin, as a response to an array of U.S. government sanctions imposed on Moscow a day earlier, including curbs to its sovereign debt market. read more

Though Moscow responded swiftly and with measures designed to hurt U.S. interests and shrink its diplomatic footprint, it left the door open for dialogue and did not kill off the idea, proposed by President Joe Biden, of a Putin-Biden summit.

""Now is the time for the United States to demonstrate good sense and to turn its back on a confrontational course,"" the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement.

""Otherwise an array of painful decisions for the American side will be implemented.""

It said it had options to hurt the United States economically and to shrink its diplomatic corps in Russia to just 300 people, but was holding fire for now.

Russia-U.S. ties slumped to a new post-Cold War low last month after Biden said he thought Putin was a ""killer"" and Moscow recalled its ambassador to Washington for consultations. The envoy has still not returned almost a month later.

The Russian foreign ministry said John Sullivan, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, should return home for consultations too.

Washington said its own sanctions were payback for Russia interfering in last year's U.S. election, cyber hacking, bullying Ukraine and other alleged malign actions.

Russia denies all the U.S. allegations.

The Russian response on Friday was ""escalatory and regrettable,"" a State Department representative said by email.

""It is not in our interest to get into an escalatory cycle, but we reserve the right to respond to any Russian retaliation against the United States.""

RETALIATION

Moscow's response was mostly tit-for-tat.

It expelled 10 U.S. diplomats and banned eight high-ranking current and former U.S. officials from entering Russia for their contribution to what it called Washington's ""anti-Russian course"".

Those banned included FBI Director Christopher Wray, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas.

Others to face an entry ban were Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons Michael Carvajal, Director of the Domestic Policy Council Susan Rice, John Bolton, the former U.S. National Security Advisor, and ex-CIA head Robert James Woolsey.

The Russian foreign ministry said it would also end the activity in Russia of U.S. funds and NGOs which it believes interfere in the country's internal affairs, while Sergei Lavrov, the foreign minister, spoke of potential ""painful"" measures aimed at U.S. business in Russia.

Other measures were designed to make it harder for the U.S. embassy to staff itself.

Biden, after imposing sanctions on Moscow, had called for a de-escalation in tensions and had said it was vital the White House and Kremlin kept communication lines open.

He has also proposed that he and Putin meet for a summit.

""(Putin) has repeatedly said we're ready to develop dialogue as much as our counterparts are ready to do so. In this sense it is probably positive that the views of the two heads of state coincide,"" Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman, told reporters before the Russian counter sanctions were unveiled.

""Their views categorically do not coincide when it comes to creating mutually beneficial relations and taking each other's interests into account,"" Peskov added, however.

The foreign ministry said Biden's Putin summit proposal had been initially well received, but was now being studied in the context of unfolding events.

""We would like to avoid a further escalation with the United States. We are ready for calm and professional dialogue,"" the ministry said.

""However the reality is that we hear one thing from Washington and in practice we see something completely different. There should be no doubt - not a single sanctions 'wave' will remain unpunished.""

The Kremlin says Putin has yet to decide whether he will take part in a U.S.-led climate summit next week.

It has also said it would be hard to quickly organise a Putin-Biden summit.

Courtesy of Dawei Watch/via REUTERS

Myanmar security forces on Thursday arrested one of the main leaders of the campaign against military rule after ramming him with a car as he led a motorbike protest rally, friends and colleagues said.

Opponents of the Feb. 1 coup that ousted an elected government led by Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi have kept up their campaign against the military this traditional New Year week with marches and various other shows of defiance.

""Our brother Wai Moe Naing was arrested. His motorbike was hit by an unmarked police car,"" Win Zaw Khiang, a member of a protest organising group, said on social media.

Wai Moe Naing, a 25-year-old Muslim, has emerged as one of the most high-profile leaders of opposition to the coup.

Earlier, Reuters spoke to him by telephone as he was setting off to lead the rally in the central town of Monywa, about 700 km (435 miles) north of the main city of Yangon.

Video posted on social media showed an oncoming car swerving into a group of motorbikes.

A spokesman for the junta could not be reached for comment.

Monywa has been one of main centres of the pro-democracy campaign with big rallies day after day and repeated crackdowns by the security forces.

Some colleagues said they feared for Wai Moe Naing's safety.

The Swedish embassy said it was following his case and urged that all detainees be allowed proper health care and their human rights be respected.

The U.S. Embassy also condemned the reported incident.

""This appalling act further demonstrates why the people of Myanmar do not accept the military regime,"" the embassy said in a post on Twitter.

PROTESTING MEDICS

In Yangon, security forces detained Myo Aye, director of the Solidarity Trade Union of Myanmar, activist Ei Thinzar Maung said on Facebook. Myo Aye has also played a major role in organising the protests.

State media said a famous actor, Zin Wine, and singer Po Po, both known for their support of the democracy movement, had also been arrested.

The coup has plunged Myanmar into crisis after 10 years of tentative steps toward democracy, with, in addition to the daily protests, strikes by workers in many sectors that have brought the economy to a standstill.

An activist group, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, says the security forces have killed 715 protesters since the overthrow of Suu Kyi's government.

Earlier on Thursday, soldiers opened fire in the city of Mandalay to disperse protesting medical workers and one man was killed and several wounded when security forces fired in a nearby neighbourhood, media reported.

Some medical workers have been at the forefront of the campaign against the coup, which for many people has dashed hopes of a more open society after tentative steps towards democracy since the military initiated reforms a decade ago.

State television announced that 20 doctors were among 40 people wanted under a law that makes it illegal to encourage mutiny or dereliction of duty in the security forces. Some 200 people are now wanted under the charge.

The military says the protests are dwindling but thousands joined protests marches and motorbike rallies in several towns, according to pictures posted by media outlets.

The United States and other Western countries have imposed limited sanctions focused on the military and called for the release of Suu Kyi and others detained by the new authorities.

Leaders of Southeast Asian neighbours, which have been trying to encourage talks between the rival Myanmar sides, are due to met in Indonesia on April 24 to discuss the situation, Thai PBS World reported.

Junta leader Senior General Min Aung Hlaing is due to attend, the broadcaster said, on what would be his first known trip abroad and contact with foreign leaders since he seized power.

The identity of the triangle- or pyramid-shaped aerial objects remains a mystery. The Defense Department isn’t sharing what it knows.

The photos and videos were first published by the Mystery Wire and Extraordinary Beliefs websites. The objects were photographed zipping over the USS Russell off San Diego in July 2019, according to investigative filmmaker Jeremy Corbell.

Photos of three unidentified flying objects reportedly taken in March that year — one spherical, another “acorn” shaped, and one described as a “metallic blimp” — were also taken by Navy personnel, Pentagon spokesperson Susan Gough told CNN.

Mystery Wire’s George Knapp reported that those objects were photographed off Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia by an F-18 weapons systems officer seated behind the pilot, who used his iPhone.

Gough offered no details on either of the sightings.

“To maintain operations security and to avoid disclosing information that may be useful to potential adversaries, the Department of Defense does not discuss publicly the details of either the observations or the examinations of reported incursions into our training ranges or designated airspace — including those incursions initially designated as UAP,” Gough told CNN, using the abbreviation for Unidentified Aerial Phenomena.

A new Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force, created last August to investigate such sightings by the military, has “included these incidents in their ongoing examinations,” Gough said.

When questioned by reporters last week, Chief of Naval Operations Michael Gilday couldn’t explain the objects.

REUTERS/Christian Hartmann

Sweden is facing an acute shortage of sperm for assisted pregnancy as would-be donors avoid hospitals during the coronavirus pandemic, halting inseminations in large parts of the healthcare system and driving up waiting times by years.

""We're running out of sperm. We've never had so few donors as during the last year,"" said Ann Thurin Kjellberg, head of the reproduction unit at Gothenburg's University Hospital.

The shortage has meant waiting times for assisted pregnancy have shot up from around six months to an estimated 30 months in the past year, possibly longer, doctors familiar with the matter told Reuters.

""It's stressful that we can't get a clear time or date for treatment,"" said Elin Bergsten, a 28-year-old maths teacher from southern Sweden.

Two years ago, Bergsten and her husband learned he was unable to produce semen, and the pair immediately applied for assisted pregnancy. She was due to have her second cycle of insemination before her treatment was indefinitely delayed due to the shortage.

""It's a national phenomenon,"" Thurin Kjellberg said. ""We've run out in Gothenburg and Malmo, they will soon run out in Stockholm,"" she added, naming the three most populous areas of the country.

Beyond public healthcare providers, there are also private clinics in Sweden which are able to circumvent shortages by buying sperm from abroad.

But assisted pregnancy treatment there often costs as much as 100,000 Swedish crowns ($11,785), making it unaffordable for many. Assisted pregnancy is free within Sweden's national health service.

The Nordic countries and Belgium have the highest assisted conception rates in the world, in terms of availability of cycles per million of population, according to the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology.

Under Swedish law, a sperm sample can only be used by a maximum of 6 women. Most donated sperm in Sweden has reached this legal capacity, meaning that in many areas, assisted pregnancy is only available for women who have used a specific sperm sample before.

Margareta Kitlinski, who runs the reproduction unit at Skane University Hospital, the largest such clinic in Sweden, said it takes around 8 months to process a donor due to the many tests involved, and that many samples fail to become viable donations due to common problems in freezing.

""If you have 50 men contact you, at best only half of them could be donors,"" Kitlinski said.

Some Swedish regions have taken to social media to encourage potential male donors, but with varying results. In the meantime, the shortage lingers.

""We need to go on TV and tell Swedish men to come forward,"" Thurin Kjellberg said.

The technology giant availed of the tax arrangement to move the money out of Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Company via interim dividends and other payments. This company was incorporated in Ireland but tax domiciled in Bermuda at the time of the transfer.

The move allowed Google Ireland Holdings to escape corporation tax both in the Republic and in the United States where its ultimate parent, Alphabet, is headquartered. The holding company reported a $13 billion pretax profit for 2019, which was effectively tax-free, the accounts show.

A year earlier, Google Ireland Holdings paid out dividends of €23 billion, having recorded turnover of $25.7 billion.

Google has used the double Irish loophole to funnel billions in global profits through Ireland and on to Bermuda, effectively putting them beyond the reach of US tax authorities.

Companies exploiting the double Irish put their intellectual property into an Irish-registered company that is controlled from a tax haven such as Bermuda.

Ireland considers the company to be tax-resident in Bermuda, while the US considers it to be tax-resident here. The result is that when royalty payments are sent to the company, they go untaxed – unless or until the money is eventually sent home to the US parent.

The “double Irish” was abolished in 2015 for new companies establishing operations in the Republic. However, controversially, it allowed those already using it until the end of 2020 to phase it out.

Google overhauled its global tax structure and consolidated its intellectual property holdings back to the United States in early 2020, meaning 2019 was the final year in which it availed of the arrangement.

Up to late 2019, Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Company was an intellectual property licensing company with turnover derived from the licensing of IP to subsidiaries. The accounts state it had no employees and that it was tax resident at the time in Bermuda, where the “standard rate tax is 0 per cent”.

Holding company

Commenting on the movement of the profits out of its Irish unit, a spokeswoman for Google said: “In December 2019, in line with the OECD’s base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) conclusions and changes to US and Irish tax laws, we simplified our corporate structure and started licensing our IP from the US, not Bermuda. The accounts filed today cover the 2019 financial year, before we made those changes.

“Including all annual and one-time income taxes over the past ten years, our global effective tax rate has been over 20 per cent, with more than 80 per cent of that tax due in the US,” she added.

The accounts state that Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Company became tax resident in Ireland from January 1st, 2021, and that it now just operates as a holding company.

Turnover for the holding company rose from $25.7 billion in 2018 to $26.5 billion in 2019. The increase was primarily due to a rise in turnover recorded by the company’s subsidiaries, which results in higher royalty payments.

Dividend income from shares in group undertakings jumped from just $2.9 million in 2018 to $597.5 million a year later. The accounts also show a $3 billion increase in research and development costs in 2019, with the company incurring R&D expenses of $10.4 billion under a cost-sharing agreement with other Google entities globally.

Google Ireland, the tech company’s main operating Irish subsidiary with over 4,000 employees, recorded €45.7 billion in revenues in 2019 with pretax profits amounting to €1.94 billion. It paid €263 million in tax that year, down nearly €9 million versus 2018.

It is estimated that US multinationals were holding more than a $1 trillion in profits offshore via mechanisms such as the double Irish and the so-called Dutch sandwich by the end of 2017. Tax cuts introduced by former US president Donald Trump in 2019 have led to some of those profits being repatriated to the United States.",676,4125,11,69

The ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has set up a hotline for people to report each other to the authorities for failing to toe the party's freshly revised line on matters of history.

The Cyberspace Administration said in a post to its official Weibo account on April 9 that people should use the number ""to report erroneous online remarks relating to historical nihilism.""

The move is to ""create a good public opinion environment"" regarding China's history since the CCP took power in 1949, the post said.

To help those who may be unsure of which opinions are the ""correct"" ones, the CCP has also published a handy guide in the form of a book titled A Brief History of the Communist Party of China.

Published to mark the party's centenary this year, the revised history plays down the cautious diplomatic approach of late supreme leader Deng Xiaoping in the wake of international sanctions following the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, instead highlighting his comments to former U.S. president Richard Nixon in November 2019.

Deng told Nixon that China would never ""beg"" for sanctions to be lifted, the book says.

The U.S. and Europe imposed an arms embargo on China after the People's Liberation Army (PLA) attached unarmed civilians with machine guns and tanks in an operation that ended weeks of pro-democracy protests on Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989.

The new edition deletes an 11,000-word chapter dedicated to the political turmoil of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) relegating the 10 years of mayhem to a single page in a chapter titled ""Twists and Turns on the Road to Socialist Reconstruction.""

The older edition, published under former president Hu Jintao in 2010, said late supreme leader Mao Zedong should bear responsibility for starting the Cultural Revolution, which turned out to be a ""serious disaster"" for the Chinese people.

The latest edition makes no such criticism of Mao, saying instead that the late Chairman had waged ""an incessant war on corruption, special privileges and bureaucratic mentality within party ranks.""

""Many of his correct ideas about how to build a socialist society weren't fully implemented, which led to internal turmoil,"" the new version says.

Chapters on the Great Famine during the Great Leap Forward of 1959-1961, the collectivization of farming under the People's Communes in the 1950s and on the often brutal ""anti-rightist"" political campaigns targeting intellectuals have also been deleted.

Forgetting the mistakes

CCP history expert Gao Wenqian said CCP general secretary Xi Jinping is revising the country's history under CCP rule in a bid to focus minds away from the party's mistakes, and to emphasize the positive roles played by leaders who ruled alone, wielding huge personal power.

""The 'History of the Communist Party of China' has always been an exercise in realpolitik,"" Gao said. ""Back when Mao Zedong launched the rectification campaign in the Yan’an period ... the CCP passed its first historical resolution, which was aimed at cementing Mao's status.""

""Deng Xiaoping also passed a historical resolution in 1981 that made a huge deal of Mao's mistakes in the wake of the Cultural Revolution, while letting Lin Biao and the Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary clique off the hook.""

""The aim was to win firm support for economic reform and opening up, and to ensure continued party rule,"" Gao said.

The book portrays Mao as a conscientious leader constantly aware of the danger of ""capitalist restoration,"" which echoes Xi's current campaign against ""imported"" notions of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.

It blames the ""civil unrest"" of the Cultural Revolution on the failure to implement Mao's ""correct"" ideas, while erasing pages of description of the campaigns against the ""four olds,"" mob justice and door-to-door raids, as well as armed clashes between rebel factions in the streets.

Gao said the claim that Mao's ""anti-corruption"" campaign was at the heart of the Cultural Revolution is a ridiculous one.

""Mao Zedong had more power and privilege than anyone else in the CCP, and similarly, Xi Jinping is one of the biggest shields for corrupt officials today,"" Gao said. ""One-party dictatorship is the most corrupt thing of all.""

""Xi Jinping is falling into the same trap that Mao did in his later years, holding a huge amount of power but still unable to sleep at night,"" Gao said. ""Xi Jinping has been in power for 10 years now, so this isn't about establishing or consolidating his power.""

""It looks a lot like the same tricks Mao used to engage in, to protect his personal power and authority,"" he said.

Keeping up the pressure

The final chapter of the new edition takes up around a quarter of the book, and is dedicated to Xi's personal brand of ideology, ""socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.""

""This new edition ... is to further keep up the ideological pressure on the Chinese people,"" Gao said. ""Back in 1967-1969 we had slogans on the walls ... Today, in Cultural Revolution 2.0, we have quotations from Xi Jinping in the People's Daily every day, and in the streets and alleyways.""

""Everyone in China has to study [this version of] party history now,"" Gao said. ""I feel sorry for the kids.""

The renewed emphasis on history comes after Xi told a Feb. 20 meeting that the history of the Chinese revolution was ""the best nourishment"" for its people.

""Our faith and beliefs are of the utmost importance at all times,"" Xi said. ""Our belief in communism and in socialism with Chinese characteristics are our political soul, and our spiritual rock that will enable us as communists to withstand any challenge.""

""The party's century of struggle and great achievements are the best foundation for us to build [self-confidence] as a nation,"" he said.

U.S.-based historian Liu Zhongjing said Xi wants Marxism-Leninism to become an inseparable part of Chinese tradition and Chinese culture, much as Buddhism was used to establish the Tang (618-907) and Song (960-1127) dynasties.

""In this way, the new China led by the descendants of Kubla Khan was able to inherit the Tang and Song dynasties, which became the newly anointed dynasties,"" Liu said.

According to Liu, Xi spoke of ""faith and beliefs"" because he is deliberately using political ideology as a new theology to underpin the CCP in a manner similar to an imperial dynasty.

U.S.-based commentator Hu Ping, honorary editor-in-chief of the online magazine ""Beijing Spring"", said Xi's revised version of party history, in trying to draw on Mao-era revolutionary tropes while at the same time still allowing capitalist-style economic activity, is trying to have its cake and eat it.

""These two periods of history [presided over by Mao and Deng] are mutually exclusive,"" Hu said. ""If the revolution had it right and the reform era had it wrong, then he should step down.""

""If the reform era had it right and the revolution was wrong, then he should change course.""

Hu said allowing private ownership of assets is at odds with the communist beliefs Xi draws on for his political ""faith.""

""The original intention of the CCP was to eliminate the private ownership of property,"" Hu said. ""After taking on the capitalists and winning, it has itself become a hugely capitalist enterprise.""

0,American export controls threaten to hinder global vaccine production,https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2021/04/17/american-export-controls-threaten-to-hinder-global-vaccine-production,"LAST WEEK the billionth dose of covid-19 vaccine was produced. It is a sign of how greatly manufacturing capacity has expanded over the past six months that the next billion doses could be produced by May 27th, according to Airfinity, an analytics firm (see chart). Yet this ambition is at risk from American export controls on raw materials and equipment. Production lines in India, making at least 160m doses of covid vaccine a month, will come to a halt in the coming weeks unless America supplies 37 critical items.

On April 16th, Adar Poonawalla, the chief executive of the Serum Institute of India (SII), the world’s biggest vaccine-maker, put out a tweet begging President Joe Biden to “lift the embargo of raw material exports out of the US...Your administration has the details”. Suresh Jadhav, SII’s executive director, says “we are absolutely concerned,” and that in the next four to six weeks the production of two vaccines will be affected: AstraZeneca’s, of which SII makes 100m doses a month, and Novavax’s, of which it expects to make 60m-70m doses a month. SII says it first alerted the American government to the impending problem two months ago. That was shortly after the Biden administration announced, on February 5th, plans to use the Defence Production Act (DPA)—legislation that grants the president broad industrial-mobilisation powers—to bolster vaccine-making. This legislation has helped American pharmaceutical companies to secure raw materials and equipment needed to make more vaccines. But American firms that supply products essential to vaccine production say the DPA hinders their ability to export them. They must seek permission before exporting goods, which requires time and paperwork, and if America’s government decides they need the goods, firms may be barred from exporting them at all. Some are also concerned about pharma companies outside of America stockpiling goods because of concerns about delays caused by American export controls. Together, export controls and stockpiling risk gumming up the global supply chain. Vaccine production requires an array of special materials, including plastic tubing, raw goods, filters and even paper. Because all these items have to be specially approved by regulators to be used in medicine production, finding substitutes quickly can be impossible.

SII is not the only company to be concerned. Export controls also affect European vaccine producers, who need special bags from America in which to make their products. At a vaccine supply-chain meeting in early March, one European pharmaceutical company complained of 66-week delivery times for the supply of bags, commenting that it would be quicker to make a steel container to manufacture them in.

On March 24th, Micheál Martin, Ireland’s prime minister, warned that export bans (and not just from America) would undermine global vaccine production, and noted that the Pfizer vaccine involves 280 components from 86 suppliers in 19 countries. Richard Hatchett, head of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a global partnership to develop vaccines, says his organisation is “extremely concerned about constraints on global supply chains”.

CEPI is part of a new task force working with industry on this problem, and has also appealed to the World Trade Organisation for support. Its new head, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, held a high-level meeting this week, which concluded that stronger supply chains were critical to addressing global vaccine inequity.

If all goes swimmingly, the world could produce as many as 14bn doses of vaccine this year. But if vaccines and raw materials do not arrive where and when needed, production will fall grievously short of that estimate. Shortfalls in India will hinder its own vaccination programme, which is ramping up amidst an alarming second wave of infections—the country is recording more than 1,000 deaths per day from covid-19. And since India has banned the export of finished vaccines while it serves domestic needs, Mr Jadhav says that SII cannot fulfill its commitments to Covax, a global vaccine-sharing programme, and cannot deliver supplies to Europe and Britain.

At a time when many American states have a surplus of vaccines, with as many as one in three doses going unused, American export restrictions are not just galling. They may soon derail the plan to vaccinate the world.

0,Biden hits Russia with new sanctions in response to election meddling,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/15/joe-biden-russia-sanctions-election-interference-hacking,"The Biden administration has announced the expulsion of 10 Russian diplomats and broad sanctions against Russian officials and companies in retaliation for Moscow’s interference in elections and cyber-espionage campaigns such as the SolarWinds hack.

The sanctions, which were the Biden administration’s largest punitive action against the Kremlin yet, also targeted six Russian cybersecurity companies deemed to be involved in the SolarWinds hack, as well as 32 individuals and entities deemed to be involved in efforts to influence the outcome of the 2020 US presidential election.

The Biden administration also barred US financial institutions from buying rouble bonds newly issued by Russia’s central bank or other large financial institutions, targeting the country’s sovereign debt and its broader economy.

In a formal statement later on Thursday, Joe Biden stressed the calibrated nature of the US measures, and his hopes that he and Vladimir Putin, whom he had warned about the coming sanctions earlier in the week, would be able to stabilise the US-Russian relationship. But at the same time he warned against any Russian military moves in Ukraine.

“I was clear with President Putin that we could have gone further, but I chose not to do so. I chose to be proportional. The United States is not looking to kick off a cycle of escalation and conflict with Russia,” Biden said in televised remarks from the White House. He confirmed he had offered Putin a summit meeting in Europe this summer, and their aides were discussing arrangements.

“Throughout our long history of competition, our two countries have been able to find ways to manage tensions, and to keep them from escalating out of control,” the president said. “I expressed my belief that communication between the two of us personally and directly was essential to moving forward to a more effective relationship.”

He said he had made clear US support for Ukrainian territorial integrity. “Now is the time to de-escalate,” Biden said. “The way forward is through thoughtful dialogue and diplomatic process.”

The report published by the administration went into granular detail exposing Russian espionage methods. For the first time, the US identified the SVR, Russia’s foreign intelligence agency, as the spy agency that carried out the SolarWinds software supply chain hack, which penetrated federal government networks and compromised more than 16,000 computers systems. Members of Russian intelligence would be among the diplomats expelled from the United States, the White House said.

Q&A What was the SolarWinds hack? Show In early 2020, malicious code was sneaked into updates to a popular piece of software called Orion, made in the US by the company SolarWinds, which monitors the computer networks of businesses and governments for outages. That malware gave hackers remote access to an organisation’s networks so they could steal information. Among the most high-profile users of the software were US government departments including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the state department, and the justice department. Described by the Microsoft president, Brad Smith, as “the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen"", US intelligence agencies have accused Russia of launching the attack. SolarWinds, of Austin, Texas, provides network monitoring and other technical services to hundreds of thousands of organisations around the world, including most Fortune 500 companies and government agencies in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. Its compromised product, Orion, is a centralised monitoring tool that looks for problems in an organisation’s computer network, which means that breaking in gave the attackers a “God view” of those networks. Neither SolarWinds nor US cybersecurity authorities have publicly identified which organisations were breached. Just because a company or agency uses SolarWinds as a vendor does not necessarily mean it was vulnerable to the hack. Kari Paul and Martin Belam

In a coordinated release, the British spy agency GCHQ on Thursday also attributed the SolarWinds hack to the SVR, and accused the agency of targeting diplomatic and military institutions in Nato countries since 2011 and research institutes since 2015. Previously identified as APT 29, Cozy Bear and the Dukes, the SVR has also been accused of penetrating the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 US presidential elections.

“We see what Russia is doing to undermine our democracies,” said the British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, in a statement. “The UK and US are calling out Russia’s malicious behaviour, to enable our international partners and businesses at home to better defend and prepare themselves against this kind of action.”

The UK foreign office said it had summoned the Russian ambassador in London to express its deep concern at what it called Moscow’s “pattern of malign activity”.

Russian officials reacted angrily to the new sanctions, with some saying it would scuttle any chance of a summit between Biden and Vladimir Putin. The Russian foreign ministry summoned the US ambassador for a “difficult talk” and called the sanctions “aggressive behaviour”, adding that Russian counter-sanctions were “inevitable”.

Those sanctioned included Alexei Gromov, a Kremlin official who curates Russia’s media and was accused of seeking “to exacerbate tensions in the United States by discrediting the 2020 US elections process”. Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Kremlin-linked businessman accused of running the Internet Research Agency online trolling operation and an overseas paramilitary outfit, was a key target of the sanctions, as were information outlets tied to Russian intelligence agencies. Konstantin Kilimnik, a Ukrainian political consultant and former aide to Paul Manafort, was also sanctioned for election interference and aiding Ukraine’s disgraced ex-president Viktor Yanukovych.

Officials had said that the new sanctions were meant to cut deeper than previous attempts to punish Moscow for its attacks on US institutions and allies. Some Russian officials have laughed off being added to the treasury department’s office of foreign assets control (OFAC) sanctions lists, comparing it to being elevated to an elite club.

There are some limits to the severity of the sanctions. Many of those in Prigozhin’s network targeted by the sanctions are intentionally expendable, and the ban on buying rouble bonds only applies to their primary issue, meaning they would remain available to trade on secondary markets.

The sanctions on IT companies that contract with government agencies could be disruptive for the sector, said Vladimir Frolov, a political analyst, but “other than that, it’s largely a signal exercise” to show Biden negotiating from a position of strength.

Nonetheless, Frolov added, Moscow might have “to respond aggressively to deny Biden the optics advantage of negotiating from a position of strength and chewing gum”.

There are already signs that the sanctions will add tension to an already strained relationship between Russia and the US. Since last month, Moscow has been engaged in the largest troop buildup on its border with Ukraine since the 2014 annexation of Crimea, provoking fears of an invasion.

The US president’s tough approach differs considerably from that of the Trump administration, which sought to avoid confronting Russia over reports of election interference. During a summit in Helsinki, Trump sided with Putin over an FBI assessment that Russia had interfered in the 2016 elections, saying: “President Putin says it’s not Russia. I don’t see any reason why it would be.”

The sanctions are also retaliation for Russian interference in the 2020 elections, in which US intelligence agencies concluded that the Kremlin had backed Trump over Biden, although it is not believed to have considerably influenced the result.

Dmitri Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, said Russia would retaliate against the new sanctions. “The principle of reciprocity applies … to best ensure our own interests.”

A senior US official said: “We want to be clear that we have no desire to be in an escalatory cycle with Russia … We intend these responses to be proportionate and tailored to the specific past actions that Russia has taken.”

He explained that until now US sanctions had covered non-rouble denominated debt, a small part of Russia’s total sovereign debt. Rouble denominated portion accounts for over 80%.

“This is a matter of principle. There’s no credible reason why the American people should directly fund Russia’s government when the Putin regime has repeatedly attempted to undermine our sovereignty,” the official said.

The Biden administration announced sanctions last month over the poisoning and imprisonment of the opposition politician Alexei Navalny. The sanctions included visa restrictions, export restrictions on items that could be used to make chemical and biological weapons, and targeted action against seven senior members of the Russian government.

The measures also entailed an expansion of sanctions under the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act.",1411,9205,11,69
0,Spanish firefighter jailed after starting a fire to ‘satisfy his ego’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/16/spanish-firefighter-jailed-after-starting-a-fire-to-satisfy-his-ego,"A volunteer firefighter who sought to “satisfy his ego” by using petrol to start a blaze that devoured 144 hectares of forest and scrubland in northern Spain has been given a three-and-a-half-year prison sentence and ordered to pay more than €158,000 (£137,000) in damages.

Luis Trueba, the former head of the Civil Protection volunteer service in Ramales de la Victoria, Cantabria, had denied deliberately setting the fire in February 2019 so that he could help put it out, insisting instead that he had rushed to the scene “out of instinct”.

But prosecutors argued he had torched the land to “satisfy his ego” and “play a leading role” in extinguishing the fire on its “frontline”.

Cantabria’s provincial court was told that Trueba’s behaviour immediately before the fire was suspicious – as was the fact that he returned to base afterwards “and took a petrol can out of the driver’s side [of his vehicle], which he tried to hide”.

Hours before the fire began, Trueba and a colleague were on a patrol after a fire-risk alert was declared in the area. His co-worker said Trueba had looked at the land and said: “It’s really dry; it just needs someone to take a match to it and see whether they crack out the hydrants.”

A fellow volunteer also told the court the accused liked fires and was like “a junkie after his fix” when it came to finding them.

An investigation was launched after the fire burned through 144.3 hectares (356 acres) of eucalyptus, gorse, bramble, scrubland and pasture in the Sierra de Alcomba on 17 and 18 February 2019.

Although Trueba claimed to have been delivering chairs to a cousin who lived elsewhere, the GPS in his regional government vehicle put him at the scene in the early hours of 17 February.

“Using petrol as an accelerant in the ditch on the left-hand side of the road from Ramales to La Alcomba, he set fire to the land in at least seven different initial points, with a distance of 65 metres between each so that the fire could spread easily,” the court said in its judgment.

It dismissed his alibi as “an “incredible excuse”, adding: “In the court’s opinion, there is ample proof of the crime beyond any reasonable doubt [and the fire] was started directly, intentionally and voluntarily.”

Trueba was found guilty of starting a forest fire of “considerable seriousness”, sentenced to three-and-a-half years’ imprisonment, and ordered to pay a fine of €3,600 and damages of €158,000.

The sentence can be appealed. The court rejected the defence’s offer of €4,000 in compensation, saying the sum would “not even cover a tenth of the costs of extinguishing the fire started by the defendant”, adding that the damages caused exceeded €200,000.

It also frowned on the defence’s suggestion that the defendant had tried to make amends by helping to put out the fire he had set “for his own personal reasons”.

The judgment concluded: “[His participation] was neither effective nor relevant given that bringing the fire under control not only required volunteers – whose role was fundamentally logistical – but also the involvement of four wildlife rangers, three forestry teams, an emergency services crew with four professional firefighters, three pumps, a water supply vehicle, a pickup truck and two amphibious air force planes.”",550,3280,11,69
0,"In Brazil, Covid-19 is killing babies and children at an alarming rate",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/brazil-alarming-high-number-babies-children-are-dying-covid-19-n1264231?cid=sm_npd_nn_fb_ma&amp;fbclid=IwAR0V3Bvm0dLMJgzYWZntnt4D00LCTLEHmHQUrZLJThj2HRgOfLLjTD_OMfA,"The coronavirus has killed an estimated 1,300 babies in Brazil since the beginning of the pandemic, even though there's overwhelming evidence that Covid-19 rarely kills young children.

While data from the Health Ministry suggest that over 800 children under age 9 have died of Covid-19, including about 500 babies, experts say the real death toll is higher because cases are underreported because of a lack of widespread coronavirus testing, according to the BBC, which first reported the story.

Dr. Fatima Marinho of the University of São Paolo, a leading epidemiologist who is a senior adviser to the international non-governmental organization Vital Strategies, estimated that the virus has killed 2,060 children under 9, including 1,302 babies. Her estimate is based on the number of excess deaths from an unspecified acute respiratory syndrome during the pandemic.

There is a misconception that children are at zero risk for Covid-19, Marinho told the BBC after she found that there have been 10 times more deaths from an unexplained respiratory syndrome over the past year compared to previous years.

Marinho added that, throughout her research, she has seen a rise in cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome among Brazilian children. The rare syndrome is a newly identified and serious health condition associated with the virus that causes Covid-19 infections. It tends to affect children up to six weeks after they are infected with the coronavirus.

Brazil has become the country with the second-highest number of Covid-19 deaths, more than 361,000 since the pandemic began, the most in the world after the United States.

Médecins Sans Frontières, or Doctors Without Borders in English, said Thursday that the government's ""failed response"" to the pandemic had led to thousands of avoidable deaths.

""More than one year into the Covid-19 pandemic, the failed response in Brazil has caused a humanitarian catastrophe,"" Dr. Christos Christou, president of Doctors Without Borders, said in a briefing with reporters. ""Each week there is a grim new record of deaths and infections — the hospitals are overflowing, and yet there is still no coordinated centralized response.""

Last week, more than a quarter of the world's coronavirus deaths were in Brazil. Christou said he expects the situation to worsen in the coming weeks if nothing changes.

So far, right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro, who has opposed lockdowns, has held large events where he often does not wear a mask. He has only recently embraced vaccines as a possible solution.

Experts in Brazil say low coronavirus testing rates, lack of contact tracing efforts and a shortage of vaccines have contributed to rises in cases and deaths. These factors have also increased the risk of exposure and potential death among more Brazilian babies and children.

""Their refusal to adapt evidence-based public health measures has sent far too many to an early grave. The response in Brazil needs an urgent, science-based and well-coordinated reset to prevent further avoidable deaths and the destruction of the once prestigious Brazilian health system,"" Christou said in a statement Thursday.

""If possible, (the women should) postpone the pregnancy a bit to a better time so that (they) can have a more peaceful pregnancy,"" Secretary of Primary Health Care of the Brazilian health ministry Raphael Camara said Friday. ""We cannot say this to those who are 42, 43 years old, of course, but for a young woman who can, the best thing is to wait for a little,"" he said during a press conference.

Brazil is second only to the US in terms of Covid-19 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University, with 368,749 deaths and more than 13.8 million cases. Cities across the country have been hit hard by a recent surge in Covid-19 cases and deaths, fueled in part by new variants believed to be extra contagious and some Brazilians' disregard for social distancing precautions.

The country could be headed for even worse times thanks to a combination of political chaos and inaction, a team of public health experts warned this week.

""In Brazil, the federal response has been a dangerous combination of inaction and wrongdoing, including the promotion of chloroquine as treatment despite a lack of evidence,"" a team led by Marcia Castro of the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, experts at the University of São Paulo and elsewhere wrote in their report, published in the journal Science.

US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday that he would withdraw all remaining US troops – about 2,500 – from Afghanistan by September 11, the 20th anniversary of the terrorist attack in New York.

The withdrawal may pose a threat to Afghanistan’s security and stability, which could spill over into Xinjiang and disrupt China’s counterterrorism efforts.

In 2018, China trained Afghan troops and helped set up a mountain brigade. The training took place in China and the aim of the brigade was to counter possible attacks by al-Qaeda and Islamic State.

“The security forces of the Afghan government are not capable of ensuring Afghan security,” said Sun Qi, an international relations specialist at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences.

“The situation in Afghanistan might go further into chaos in the future. Cross-border crime, drug trafficking and smuggling of firearms may proliferate,” he said.

While Beijing would not station troops in Afghanistan, it might work with other countries in the region to promote political stability and reduce the security risk to China, Sun said.

“If the security situation poses a significant threat, China may send peacekeeping troops along with humanitarian assistance to the region under the terms of the Charter of the United Nations to ensure the safety and interests of Chinese people and companies there,” he said.

Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Thursday that foreign troops stationed in Afghanistan should withdraw in a “responsible and orderly manner” to prevent terrorist forces from taking advantage of the chaos.

“The United States is the biggest external factor affecting the Afghan issue. The relevant decisions and actions of the United States should fully respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Afghanistan, earnestly take responsibility for maintaining the results of peace and reconstruction in Afghanistan,” he said.

Soon after Biden’s announcement, Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance planned to withdraw its troops – about 7,000 – from Afghanistan by next month. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Thursday that Australia would also complete its military withdrawal from Afghanistan in September.

Other experts said China was unlikely to push too hard to gain influence in Afghanistan as there was already fierce competition in the region.

“A number of countries, including Pakistan, India and Russia, want to exert their influence in the region, so China really needs to be careful of getting involved in the chaos,” said Wang Jin, a research fellow at the Charhar Institute think tank in northern China.

China and the US were unlikely to engage in any significant cooperation in Afghanistan after the US troop withdrawal, given the tensions between the two countries, he said.

“We can see from the withdrawal of US troops that the willingness of the US to intervene in Afghanistan’s affairs is declining,” he said.

“Primarily because the idea of solving local conflicts by establishing a Western-style democracy in Afghanistan has failed.”

Sun said the US was likely to withdraw its military deployments from Central Asia and redeploy them to the Asia-Pacific.

“The withdrawal from Afghanistan allows the US to boost its military presence in Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean regions, with the aim of containing China,” he said.

“The US is highly likely to increase its military activity in the South China Sea and China-Indochina peninsula.”

REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/File Photo

India’s capital New Delhi recorded 25,500 coronavirus cases in a 24-hour period, with about one in three people tested returning a positive result, its chief minister said, urging the federal government to provide more hospital beds to tackle the crisis.

Less than 100 critical care beds were available in the city of more than 20 million people, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Sunday, as social media was flooded with people complaining about lack of beds, oxygen cylinders and drugs.

""The bigger worry is that in last 24 hours positivity rate has increased to around 30% from 24% ... The cases are rising very rapidly. The beds are filling fast,"" Kejriwal told a news briefing.

In a separate statement, the city government said it had informed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's federal administration about ""the dire need of beds and oxygen"" and beds were now being set up in schools.

New Delhi, which has imposed a weekend curfew, is among the worst hit cities in India, where a second major wave of coronavirus infections is straining health infrastructure.

Nationwide, India reported 261,500 new cases on Sunday, taking the total number of cases to nearly 14.8 million, second only to the United States, which has reported more than 31 million infections. The country's deaths from COVID-19 rose by a record 1,501 to reach a total of 177,150.

As cases rise across India, criticism is mounting over how Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration has handled the health crisis, as religious festivals and election rallies attended by thousands continue.

India’s government relaxed almost all lockdown curbs of last year by the beginning of 2021, although some regions including New Delhi and the state of Maharashtra, home to financial hub Mumbai, have introduced localised restrictions.

While Mumbai remains under curfew on all days as per state guidelines, New Delhi has allowed cinema halls to operate at 30% capacity and people to move freely during weekdays.

""There is no option but to lockdown Delhi for 1-2 weeks,"" said Dr. Ambrish Mithal, a top doctor of endocrinology and diabetes at hospital operator Max Healthcare, adding that weekend curfews ""won't do"".

""(The) situation is unmanageable at present,"" he said on Twitter.

ELECTION RALLIES

Amid reports of severe shortage of oxygen supplies and critical medicines such as the anti-viral drug Remdesivir, Modi on Saturday asked authorities to pull out all the stops to ramp up production of COVID-19 vaccines and asked his teams to work closely with local governments.

But opposition parties, including the Congress party, criticised Modi for addressing large election rallies to help his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) win the state assembly election in the eastern state of West Bengal.

Addressing a large gathering of his supporters in West Bengal on Saturday, Modi said: ""I can see a sea of masses. I haven't seen a rally like this.""

The Aam Aadmi (Common Man) Party, which is in power in the capital, New Delhi, mocked Modi's political rallies by posting pictures on social media of funeral pyres at overburdened crematoriums of the city.

""I deplore his (Modi's) remarks,"" Yashwant Sinha, a former cabinet minister who broke away from the BJP, said on Twitter, adding that they were insensitive.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi - who has also addressed election rallies in recent weeks - said on Sunday he was suspending all his public rallies in West Bengal.

Amit Shah, the government's interior minister and Modi's close aide, addressed an election rally in the state on Sunday which was attended by thousands of people, few of whom followed social distancing norms, according to a video on his Twitter account.

Adding to the crisis, at least five coronavirus patients died in a hospital fire late on Saturday in Raipur, the capital of the central state of Chhattisgarh.

0,Raúl Castro confirms he is resigning as head of Cuba’s Communist party,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/16/raul-castro-cuba-communist-party-resigning,"Raúl Castro has confirmed that he is resigning as head of Cuba’s Communist party, ending an era of formal leadership by him and his brother Fidel Castro that began with the 1959 revolution.

The 89-year-old Castro made the announcement on Friday in a speech at the opening of the eighth congress of the ruling party – the only one allowed on the island.

“I believe fervently in the strength and exemplary nature and comprehension of my compatriots, and as long as I live I will be ready with my foot in the stirrups to defend the fatherland, the revolution and socialism,” Castro told hundreds of party delegates gathered at a convention center in Havana.

He said he was retiring with the sense of having “fulfilled his mission and confident in the future of the fatherland”.

Castro did not say who he would endorse as his successor as first secretary of the Communist party. But he previously indicated that he favors yielding control to 60-year-old Miguel Díaz-Canel, who succeeded him as president in 2018 and is the standard bearer of a younger generation of loyalists who have been pushing an economic opening without touching Cuba’s one-party system.

His retirement means that for the first time in more than six decades, Cubans will not have a Castro formally guiding their affairs, and it comes at a difficult time, with many on the island anxious about what lies ahead.

The coronavirus pandemic, painful financial reforms and restrictions imposed by the Trump administration have battered the economy, which shrank 11% last year as a result of a collapse in tourism and remittances. Long food lines and shortages have brought back echoes of the “special period” that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s.

Discontent has been fueled by the spread of the internet and growing inequality.

Much of the debate inside Cuba is focused on the pace of reform, with many complaining that the so-called “historic generation” represented by Castro has been too slow to open the economy.

In January, Diaz-Canel finally pulled the trigger on a plan approved two congresses ago to unify the island’s dual currency system, giving rise to fears of inflation. He also threw the doors open to a broader range of private enterprise – a category long banned or tightly restricted – permitting Cubans to legally operate many sorts of self-run businesses from their homes.

This year’s congress is expected to focus on unfinished reforms to overhaul state-run enterprises, attract foreign investment and provide more legal protection to private business activities.

The Communist party is made up of 700,000 activists and is tasked in Cuba’s constitution with directing the affairs of the nation and society.

Fidel Castro, who led the revolution that drove dictator Fulgencio Batista from power in 1959, formally became head of the party in 1965, about four years after officially embracing socialism.

He quickly absorbed the old party under his control and was the country’s unquestioned leader until falling ill in 2006 and in 2008 handing over the presidency to his younger brother Raúl, who had fought alongside him during the revolution.

The steps highlight rising fears of an implosion of the Lebanese state, in which authorities can no longer import food or fuel to keep the lights on. They underline Hezbollah 's growing role in tackling the emergency with services that the government would otherwise provide.

The plan chimes with worries in Lebanon that people will have to rely on political factions for food and security, in the way many did in the militia days of the 1975-1990 civil war.

In response to a question about Hezbollah's plans, Leila Hatoum, an adviser to the caretaker prime minister, said the country was ""in no condition to refuse aid"" regardless of politics.

The sources from the pro-Hezbollah camp, who declined to be named, said the plan for a potential worst-case scenario has gathered pace as an end to subsidies looms in the coming months, raising the specter of hunger and unrest.

Lebanon's currency has crashed as the country runs out of dollars, with no state rescue in sight. Food prices have shot up 400%.

Fights in supermarkets are now commonplace, as are people rummaging through trash. A brawl over food packages this week killed one person and injured two others.

Hezbollah's plan would help shield its communities - not only members but also mainly Shi'ite residents of districts it dominates - from the worst of the crisis, the sources said. It could also contain any restlessness among core supporters, analysts say.

Hezbollah, which with its allies has a majority in parliament and government, did not respond to a request for comment.

""The preparations have begun for the next stage...It is indeed an economic battle plan,"" said one of the sources, a senior official.

Already, the new ration card, seen by Reuters, helps hundreds of people buy basic goods in the local currency - largely Iranian, Lebanese and Syrian cheaper items at a discount up to 40%, subsidized by the party, the sources said.

The card - named after a Shi'ite Imam - can be used at co-ops, some of them newly opened, in the southern Beirut suburbs and parts of southern Lebanon where Hezbollah holds sway. The sources did not elaborate on the budget or recipients.

An Iran-funded paramilitary force which critics once called ""a state within a state,"" Hezbollah has grown more entangled in Lebanese state affairs in recent years.

Washington, which deems Hezbollah a terrorist group, has ramped up sanctions to choke off its sources of funding, including what it estimates as hundreds of millions of dollars from Tehran every year.

Iranian funding keeps Hezbollah better off than many in the country's mosaic of parties, including those opposed to its arsenal. Some factions have issued aid baskets to their patronage communities, but the Iran-backed network remains outsized in comparison.

""They're all doing it...But Hezbollah's scope is much bigger and more powerful, with more resources to deal with the crisis,"" said Joseph Daher, a researcher who wrote a book on Hezbollah's political economy. ""This is more about limiting the catastrophe for its popular base. It means the dependency on Hezbollah particularly will increase.""

And while Hezbollah gives ration cards, the state, hollowed out by decades of graft and debt, has talked up the idea of such a card for poor Lebanese for nearly a year without acting.

Ministers have said the need for parliamentary approval has stalled the cabinet's plan for cards.

DARKNESS AND HUNGER

Photos on social media of shelves stacked with canned goods, reportedly from one of Hezbollah's co-ops, spread across Lebanon last week.

Fatima Hamoud, in her 50s, said the ration card allows her once a month to buy grains, oil and cleaning products for a household of eight. ""They know we're in bad shape,"" she said. ""Without them, what would we have done in these tough times.""

A second Shi'ite source said Hezbollah had filled up warehouses and launched the cards to extend services outside the party and plug gaps in the Lebanese market, where cheap alternatives are more common than pre-crisis.

He said the card offers a quota, based on the family size, for needs like sugar and flour.

The goods are backed by Hezbollah, imported by allied companies or brought in without customs fees through the border with Syria, where Hezbollah forces have a footing since joining the war to back Damascus alongside Iran.

The source added that Hezbollah had similar plans for medicine imports. Some pharmacists in the southern suburbs of Beirut said they had received training on new Iranian and Syrian brands that popped up on the shelves in recent months.

Two of the sources said the plan included stockpiling fuel from Iran, as Lebanon's energy ministry warns of a possible total blackout. The senior official said Hezbollah was clearing storage space for fuel in next-door Syria.",847,5363,12,70

The United Nations refugee agency is urging Bangladesh to slow down its relocation of Rohingya to a low-lying island because measures to protect residents from storms and flooding are not fully in place, UNHCR in Dhaka told BenarNews on Friday.

Meanwhile, the foreign minister said, international agencies must help foot the cost of housing what could eventually be 100,000 refugees on Bhashan Char, an island in the Bay of Bengal. So far, Bangladesh’s government has covered that cost.

A UNHCR team visited the island March 17-20 and recognized that the government had made “extensive investments” in setting up infrastructure and safeguards on the flood-prone island for the thousands of Rohingya who have moved there, said Charlie Goodlake, a spokesman for the U.N. agency in Dhaka.

“At the same time, the U.N. team believes it is critical that the ongoing extension of the embankment is completed as early as possible and to full specification which, when complete, would reduce the risk of storm surges and flooding on the island,” Goodlake told BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service, in a statement.

In addition, it was also essential to put in place an emergency management plan for severe weather events, including building up stocks of essential supplies and goods on the island, UNHCR said.

“The U.N. team recommends to the government that any future relocations are undertaken in a gradual and phased manner, which would help to ensure that the governance structure, facilities and services available on Bhashan Char are commensurate to the needs of Rohingya refugees living there,” Goodlake said.

Since December, the government has moved a total of 18,304 Rohingya from crowded camps in southeastern Cox’s Bazar district. The camps host around 1 million refugees who fled persecution in Rakhine state, next-door in Myanmar.

The government had said it spent about U.S. $280 million to construct housing, a large embankment to protect the island’s population from flooding, and other infrastructure in a bid to relieve pressure on the crowded mainland camps.

An official told BenarNews in December 2018 that the embankment would gradually be made 21 feet high, although he did not say how tall the embankment was at the time.

Last December, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had said Bhashan Char was secure from cyclones, as was demonstrated during the deadly Cyclone Amphan in May 2020.

“The flood and shore protection measures with the 12.1 km- [7.5 mile-] long and sufficiently higher embankment designed by [British firm] HR Wallingford secures the island from massive tidal waves and cyclones,” the ministry said in a statement.

“This is supplemented by the installation of modern hydrographic monitoring and warning system that can provide early warning on any natural hazards and enable prior evacuation.”

Funds for Rohingya on island

Bangladesh’s government wants international funds raised through the U.N. Joint Response Plan to be used for the Rohingya on Bhashan Char as well, Foreign Minister A.K. Abdul Momen said on Friday.

If funds are focused only on humanitarian efforts in Cox’s Bazar, the government will demand a share of the funds for facilities on the island, he said.

“If the humanitarian agencies do not support the Rohingya in Bhashan Char, we will demand 10 percent of those funds,” Momen told BenarNews, even as he acknowledged that he did not know how the UNHCR spends the funds it collects for the Rohingya and their host communities.

He said U.N. agencies were obligated to provide services for the Rohingya regardless of where the refugees live. And U.N. member-states, he said, would not provide funds if humanitarian agencies did not provide services to Rohingya in Bhashan Char as well.

In response, Goodlake, the UNHCR’s Dhaka spokesman, said that if the U.N. were to “operationally engage” in the island, “any related funding requirements for Bhashan Char would need to be agreed in close consultation with relevant stakeholders, notably with the donor community and the government.”

The U.N. team that visited the island last month said it “clearly” recognized the prevailing humanitarian and protection needs of the Rohingya refugees already relocated to Bhashan Char, he said.

“The U.N. has therefore proposed further discussions with the government regarding its future operational engagement on Bhashan Char, including on the policies that govern the life and wellbeing of Rohingya refugees on the island,” Goodlake said.

Momen’s comments about funding for Bhashan Char followed months-long criticism of Bangladesh’s plan to move Rohingya to the off-shore site.

International humanitarian organizations have expressed concern about the safety and on-site facilities on the island. Their fears were not mitigated by what was perceived as reluctance by Bangladesh to allow the U.N. to conduct a technical assessment of the island.

But many Rohingya who moved to Bhashan Char have told BenarNews that they were happy to have left the congested Cox’s Bazar camps. Living conditions on Bhashan Char were better, they said, and their children had wide open spaces where they could play.

And now that a U.N. team and three other international organizations have visited the island, many Bangladeshi analysts believe that any worries about the island’s habitability would be allayed.

The U.N. team which visited Bhashan Char found that many of the Rohingya were engaged in constructive activities and felt optimistic about their lives there, Goodlake acknowledged.

U.S. special envoy John Kerry, who visited Bangladesh last week, heaped praise on Bangladesh for its “extraordinary” generosity in sheltering the refugees from Myanmar, and mentioned Dhaka’s decision to relocate thousands of Rohingya to Bhashan Char.

“Bangladesh has been one of the greatest helping hands, you’ve given them an island,” Kerry, President Joe Biden’s special envoy for the climate, told reporters in Dhaka on April 9.

These fragments of wilderness undamaged by human activities are mainly in parts of the Amazon and Congo tropical forests, east Siberian and northern Canadian forests and tundra, and the Sahara. Invasive alien species including cats, foxes, rabbits, goats and camels have had a major impact on native species in Australia, with the study finding no intact areas left.

The researchers suggest reintroducing a small number of important species to some damaged areas, such as elephants or wolves – a move that could restore up to 20% of the world’s land to ecological intactness.

Q&A What are the five biggest threats to biodiversity? Show According to the UN’s Convention on Biological Diversity there are five main threats to biodiversity. In descending order these are; changes in land and sea use; direct exploitation of organisms; climate change; pollution and invasive species. Converting wild spaces into agricultural land and the intensification of farming practices is causing the greatest destruction. Between 2010 and 2015, 3.3m hectares (8.1m acres) of forest disappeared, with no sign of rates slowing down. Predictions suggest agricultural land could increase by 18% by 2050, further removing the land available to nature. As agriculture intensifies, things like wetlands, scrubland and woodlands – which wildlife relies on – are ironed out from the landscape. In marine environments, overfishing is considered to be the most serious driver of biodiversity loss. One quarter of the world’s commercial fisheries are overexploited, according to a 2005 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. Harvesting of wood, keeping livestock in high densities and water abstraction are also all negatively affecting ecosystems through overexploitation of natural resources. Climate change is dismantling ecosystems at every level. Extreme weather events such as tropical storms and flooding are destroying habitats. Warmer temperatures are also changing the timing of natural events – such as the availability of insects and when birds hatch their eggs in spring. The distribution of species and their range is also changing – mountain species are particularly vulnerable because they have little opportunities to move as temperatures warm. In marine environments, pollution from agricultural runoff (mainly nitrogen and phosphorus) is a huge problem. When these chemicals leak into the wider environment they change ecosystems by increasing the nutrient-value – this means fast-growing species that like high-nutrient environments outcompete slower growing species that favour nutrient-poor environments. Agricultural runoff causes toxic algal blooms and even ""dead zones"" in the worst-affected areas. Since the 17th century, invasive species have contributed to 40% of all known animal extinctions. Invasive species change the composition of ecosystems by outcompeting native species. With increased travel and tourism, there is a higher risk of species hitchhiking to new areas. For example, invasive earthworms carried in the treads of hiking boots are believed to be changing Arctic ecosystems.

Previous analyses have identified wilderness areas based largely on satellite images and estimated that 20-40% of the Earth’s surface is little affected by humans. However, the scientists behind the new study argue that forests, savannah and tundra can appear intact from above but that, on the ground, vital species are missing. Elephants, for example, spread seeds and create important clearings in forests, while wolves can control populations of deer and elk.

The new assessment combines maps of human damage to habitat with maps showing where animals have disappeared from their original ranges or are too few in number to maintain a healthy ecosystem. Some scientists said the new analysis underestimates the intact areas, because the ranges of animals centuries ago are poorly known and the new maps do not take account of the impacts of the climate crisis, which is changing the ranges of species.

It is widely accepted that the world is in a biodiversity crisis, with many wildlife populations – from lions to insects – plunging, mainly due to the destruction of habitat for farming and building. Some scientists think a sixth mass extinction of life on Earth is beginning, with serious consequences for the food, and clean water and air that humanity depends upon.

“Much of what we consider as intact habitat is missing species that have been hunted [and poached] by people, or lost because of invasive species or disease,” said Dr Andrew Plumptre, the lead author of the study, from the Key Biodiversity Areas Secretariat in Cambridge, UK. “It’s fairly scary, because it shows how unique places like the Serengeti are, which actually have functioning and fully intact ecosystems.

“We’re in the UN decade of ecosystem restoration now, but it is focusing on degraded habitat,” he said. “Let’s also think about restoring species so that we can try and build up these areas where we’ve got ecologically intact ecosystems.”

The research, published in the journal Frontiers in Forests and Global Change, used maps of the ranges of 7,000 species in 1,500 and today from the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List. Most of the data was for mammals, but it also included some birds, fish, plants, reptiles and amphibians. Many of the intact areas identified were in territories managed by indigenous communities. The analysis did not include Antarctica.

“It might be possible to increase the ecological intact area back to up to 20% through the targeted reintroductions of species that have been lost in areas where human impact is still low, provided the threats to their survival can be addressed,” said Plumptre. He cited the successful reintroduction of wolves into Yellowstone national park in the US, which transformed the ecosystem.

Prof Pierre Ibisch, at the Eberswalde University for Sustainable Development in Germany and not part of the study, said finding just 3% of land was intact was “predictably devastating”. He said: “We need to give nature significantly more space to carry us into the future, [but] I fear that the reintroduction of a few species in certain areas is not a gamechanger.”

Ibisch said the analysis did not take account of the climate crisis. “Accelerating climate change is becoming the overarching threat to the functionality of entire ecosystems. Yesterday’s mammal intactness hardly tells us a lot about the functioning ecosystems in the [global heating] age.”

Prof James Watson at the University of Queensland, Australia, said: “This study undervalues many efforts by ecosystem scientists to map and save ecologically intact places across the planet. It uses maps for species that are basically best guesses, meaning the message of where ecosystems are actually still pretty much intact is clearly minimised.”

Plumptre acknowledged that the species range maps were relatively crude and said the 3% figure was a “ballpark estimate”. He said: “The trouble is, at the moment, we don’t have any other maps.” Scientists should next focus on specific regions and use more detailed human impact data and species data to identify ecologically intact sites, he said.

In January, more than 50 countries committed to protect almost a third of the planet by 2030 to halt the destruction of the natural world. “Putting efforts into conserving these [intact] places is very important,” Plumptre said. “They are so rare and special, and show what the world was like before humans had any major impact, helping us measure how much we’ve lost.”",1205,7742,11,70

This infrared satellite loop shows Super Typhoon Surigae bringing rain and strong winds to portions of the Philippines on April 18, 2021. (CIRA/RAAMB) Surigae became the first typhoon of 2021 in the West Pacific Basin during the middle of last week, then set another first after rapidly strengthening into a super typhoon to start the weekend. Now AccuWeather meteorologists warn that this powerful storm can bring dangerous impacts to the eastern Philippines. As of Sunday morning, local time, Surigae was packing one-minute maximum sustained winds of 138 mph (222 km/h) and wind gusts reaching as high as 166 mph (267 km/h). Surigae became the first tropical system of the year to reach super typhoon status on Saturday, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). At one point on Sunday morning, Surigae's strength was equivalent to a Category 5 major hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Eastern Pacific. The storm has since returned to the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane, which is still considered a major hurricane. This satellite loop shows Typhoon Surigae gaining strength across the Philippine Sea early Saturday afternoon, April 17, 2021. Surigae had developed an ""eye"" which often indicates a strong tropical system. (CIRA/RAMMB) The storm was given the name Bising in the Philippines once it entered the area monitored by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA). Once a tropical storm or typhoon enters this area, it is given a name by PAGASA separate from the international name that it may have already been designated. Light-to-moderate wind shear and warm water in the southern Philippine Sea will allow Surigae to maintain about the same intensity over the next couple of days as it tracks near the Philippines. CLICK HERE FOR THE FREE ACCUWEATHER APP The storm began lashing the eastern Philippines late Saturday as the outer rainbands reached the Visayas. Surigae is forecast to brush the eastern Philippines through the beginning of the week as it tracks just offshore, said AccuWeather Meteorologist Tony Zartman. On Sunday morning, local time, Catanduanes Governor Joseph Cua put mandatory evacuation orders in place for residents living near shorelines, riverbanks and landslide-prone areas in the Catanduanes province. A tumultuous sea could be seen just offshore of the province Sunday morning as Super Typhoon Surigae approached the area. All inbound and outbound flights have been cancelled at the Tacloban City Airport, located on the Leyte Island of the central Philippines, as heave rain and winds from the typhoon began battering the area. No damage has been reported as of Saturday evening, local time. The levels of impacts Surigae can unleash on the eastern Philippines will depend on when the storm gets pulled north by a nontropical storm system tracking over eastern China and Japan this weekend. The super typhoon is already beginning to turn more to the north, tracking just close enough for the heaviest rain and strong winds to reach the islands of Samar, Catanduanes and far southeastern Luzon in the eastern Philippines. This infrared satellite loop shows Surigae in the Philippine Sea on April 17, 2021 after becoming the first system to reach super typhoon status in 2021. (CIRA/RAAMB) Rain amounts are forecast to reach as high as 8-12 inches (200-300 mm) in the eastern Visayas and southeast Luzon through Wednesday with an AccuWeather Local StormMax™ of 16 inches (400 mm). This can lead to flash flooding and the threat for mudslides across the region. Across the rest of the eastern Philippines, 2-4 inches (50-100 mm) of rain is expected. Winds from the storm will be highly dependent on how close the typhoon tracks to the coast, though Zartman anticipates the possibility for wind gusts to near 160 km/h (100 mph), which can lead to power outages and some structural damage. However, if the super typhoon is pulled north sooner, the heaviest rain and strongest winds can remain just offshore of the eastern Philippines. Regardless of the exact track, the strong winds from the storm are likely to produce dangerous seas across the eastern Philippines beginning late this week and continuing into early next week. Boaters should use caution if venturing into offshore waters. After turning to the north, Surigae may lose some forward momentum during the second half of next week. By the end of the week, another nontropical storm is forecast to track from China to Japan. This storm may to pick up Surigae and turn the typhoon to the east before it gets absorbed by the system. After turning to the north of the Philippines, Surigae is likely to run into less favorable conditions for tropical cyclones, said Zartman, adding that this could cause the storm to lose wind intensity later next week. Surigae will still have to be watched closely as impacts to Iwo To and the Volcano Islands to the south of mainland Japan cannot yet be ruled out. As the storm was strengthening late last week it brought 9.09 inches (231 mm) of rainfall to Koror, the largest city in Palau, in just 24 hours. While there is no official start or end date to the tropical season in the West Pacific, most tropical systems develop between May and October.

France's top court has ruled that he will not go on trial because he was in a drug-induced psychosis.

Cannabis was found in Traoré's blood after he was taken into custody for the killing.

Visit Insider's homepage for more stories.

France's top court ruled on Wednesday that the killer of an elderly Jewish woman will not go on trial, France24 reported.

Kobili Traoré admitted to murdering his neighbor, Sarah Halimi, in 2017. He shouted ""Allahu Akbar,"" or ""God is great"" in Arabic, and ""I killed the devil,"" shortly before throwing her off the balcony of her third-floor Paris apartment, The New York Times said.

On Wednesday, the Court of Cassation — France's final court of appeal — affirmed two prior judgments that ruled that Traoré could not be held criminally responsible for his actions because he was in a state of drug-induced psychosis.

Traoré, a drug dealer, smoked pot every day for 13 years and had up to 15 joints a day, Israel Hayom reported. Toxicological analysis revealed the presence of cannabis in his blood on the day he was arrested, the French newspaper Libération said.

The court noted that ""a person is not criminally responsible if suffering, at the time of the event, from psychic or neuropsychic disturbance that has eliminated all discernment or control,"" The Times said.

Traoré will be held in mental health institutions until doctors deem him fit to return to society, according to reports.

In December 2019, President Emmanuel Macron made a rare intervention by criticizing the Paris appeals court for saying that Traore was unfit for trial.

""Even if, in the end, the judge decided that there was no criminal responsibility, there is a need for a trial,"" Macron said in 2020.

The country's top magistrates then criticized Macron for impacting the ""independence of the justice system,"" The Times of Israel reported.

The ruling has angered French politicians and France's Jewish community, the largest in Europe.

0,Caterpillars in court as M&amp;S sues Aldi over Colin cake ‘lookalike’,https://amp.theguardian.com/business/2021/apr/15/ms-takes-aldi-to-court-over-colin-the-caterpillar-look-alike-cake,"It is being billed as the ultimate food fight and could get nasty: Colin the Caterpillar is going to war with lookalike Cuthbert.

On Thursday, Marks & Spencer said it had begun legal action against Aldi to “protect” Colin from the discount grocer’s rival chocolate sponge roll Cuthbert which, for a smaller fee, has been masquerading as Colin at birthday parties and on picnics.

With their hard chocolate shells decorated with sweeties and white chocolate grinning faces, it is difficult to tell Colin and Cuthbert apart – until you have had a bite, anyway.

M&S argues the similarities mean consumers think they are of the same standard, enabling its cheaper rival – Cuthbert costs £5 while Colin is £7 – to “ride on the coat-tails” of the company’s reputation for high-quality food.

Colin the Caterpillar made his debut in 1990 and, with more than 15m cake sales under his belt has, like Rihanna, become known to fans by just his first name. He is also known for his philanthropy, thanks to a tie-up with the cancer charity Macmillan.

His fame has led to a number of brand extensions, including his girlfriend (cake) Connie and most recently his branded cake jars, which caused a storm on social media. One wag suggested the pots represented the “rather gross metamorphosis stage between Colin the Caterpillar and Colin the Beautiful Butterfly”.

M&S, which has lodged an intellectual property claim with the high court this week, has three trademarks relating to its caterpillar cake, including the words “Colin the Caterpillar” and the packaging. It wants Aldi to remove Cuthbert from its shelves and agree not to sell anything similar in the future.

There have been a number of similar disputes in recent years, including a 2018 row when Hotel Chocolat accused Waitrose of plagiarism.

It is not the first time copycat claims have been levelled at Aldi. In 2019, the chain delisted its Moo gourmet yoghurt after the cofounder of Collective, Amelia Harvey, claimed the products looked too similar to the brand’s own. It had a similar row with the sausage brand Heck.

In a statement, M&S said: “Love and care goes into every product on our shelves. So we want to protect Colin, Connie and our reputation for freshness, quality, innovation and value.” Aldi declined to comment.

Mark Caddle, a partner at the intellectual property firm, Withers & Rogers, described the case as the “battle of the caterpillars”.

“Colin the Caterpillar has been very popular in the UK market, which could aid M&S’s case,” Caddle said.

“The high court’s decision will rest on whether it thinks Aldi is seeking to benefit commercially by bringing a confusingly similar product to market.”",446,2677,11,70
0,An end to cigarettes? New Zealand aims to create smoke-free generation,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/16/new-zealand-aims-to-create-smoke-free-generation-cigarettes,"New Zealand has announced a suite of proposals aimed at outlawing smoking for the next generation and moving the country closer to its goal of being smoke-free by 2025.

The plans include the gradual increase of the legal smoking age, which could extend to a ban on the sale of cigarettes and tobacco products to anyone born after 2004, making smoking effectively illegal for that generation.

Also under consideration was a significant reduction in the level of nicotine allowed in tobacco products, prohibiting filters, setting a minimum price for tobacco, and restricting the locations where tobacco and cigarettes can be sold.

“We need a new approach,” Associate Health Minister Dr Ayesha Verrall said on Thursday, announcing the changes. “About 4,500 New Zealanders die every year from tobacco, and we need to make accelerated progress to be able to reach that goal [of Smokefree 2025]. Business-as-usual without a tobacco control program won’t get us there.”

The proposals were welcomed by a number of public health organisations. “This proposal goes beyond assisting people to quit,” Cancer Society chief executive Lucy Elwood said in a statement. She noted that the number of tobacco retailers was four times higher in low-income communities, where smoking rates were highest.

“These glaring inequities are why we need to protect future generations from the harms of tobacco,” Elwood said. “Tobacco is the most harmful consumer product in history and needs to be phased out.”

Shane Kawenata Bradbrook, a long- term advocate for smoke-free Māori communities, said in a statement that the plan “will begin the final demise of tobacco products in this country”. Smoking rates are highest among Māori and Pasifika New Zealanders, and he said it was vital those communities had a voice in the process.

“For too long the tobacco industry has been addicting our people, fleecing them of their money before we have to bury them in urupa [burial grounds] all over this land. I am looking forward to truly making this a sunset industry in this corner of the world.”

El-Shadan Tautolo, a professor of public health at Auckland University of Technology, also called the plan “a turning point”. If it included enough resources and the right people, “we will be able to reach our communities who have been underserved and under-resourced for long enough,” he said.

But the plans also faced criticism for potential unintended consequences, including the prospect of bankruptcy for small ‘dairy’ store owners, and the possibility of an expanded black market for tobacco. The government acknowledged this was a risk in its document outlining proposals: “Evidence indicates that the amount of tobacco products being smuggled into New Zealand has increased substantially in recent years and organised criminal groups are involved in large-scale smuggling,” it said.

Right-wing political party ACT said lowering nicotine content could result in smokers buying and smoking more to get their hit. “New Zealand smokers who can least afford it will spend more on their habit and in turn do harm to those around them if the government mandates lower nicotine,” the ACT social development and children spokesperson, Karen Chhour, said in a press release.

The move also sparked questions about the extent to which the government should intervene in people’s lives: “There’s a philosophical principle about adults being able to make decisions for themselves, within reason,” journalist Alex Braae wrote in an analysis for the Spinoff.

Smoking accounts for one in four cancer deaths in New Zealand, and around half a million New Zealanders smoke daily. The effects of that are most-felt among Māori, New Zealand’s indigenous people: Māori women have the country’s highest smoking rates, with about 30% smoking daily. Cancer is the leading cause of death for Māori women and the second leading cause for Māori men.",623,3902,11,70
0,$25 Million Worth Of Giant Clam Shells Seized In The Philippines : NPR,https://www.npr.org/2021/04/17/988432212/-25-million-worth-of-giant-clam-shells-seized-in-the-philippines,"$25 Million Worth Of Giant Clam Shells Seized In The Philippines

More than 200 tons of fossilized giant clam shells, worth nearly $25 million, were seized in a joint law enforcement raid in the Philippines' province of Palawan Friday. The Philippine Coast Guard said the haul was the largest to date in the province.

The Tridacna gigas, better known as a giant clam, or taklobo in the Philippines, is the largest living bivalve mollusk. They can grow larger than 4 feet across and weigh more than 400 lbs. It's also considered an endangered species by the Philippines' Department of Agriculture.

Four suspects, ranging in age from 40 to 54, have been taken into custody for violating the Wildlife Resources Conservation and Protection Act. They face up to eight years in prison and a fine equivalent to more than $62,000.

This was the third clam bust for the coast guard in just over a month. Another 18 tons was seized earlier in the week. The sum of that raid was just under $1.2 million. And in early March, another bust amounting to $3.3 million in value.

It is illegal to catch, gather, sell, purchase, possess or transport taklobo or any other protected species, the Philippines state news agency said.

It takes giant clams many years to reach full size, but they can live 100 years. Their shells provide a home to billions of algae, which give the clams' mantle such brilliant colors. They also filter out excess nutrients and pollutants while filter-feeding on plankton.

The Nanyang Technological University says poachers harvest the clams by dredging along the ocean floor and destroying coral reef systems with boat propellers. The shells are seen as a status symbol and can be used as ornaments, jewelry, tableware and even floor tiling.",296,1755,13,70
0,India may build new coal plants due to low cost despite climate change,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-electricity-policy-exclusive/exclusive-india-may-build-new-coal-plants-due-to-low-cost-despite-climate-change-idUSKBN2C50RN,"CHENNAI (Reuters) - India may build new coal-fired power plants as they generate the cheapest power, according to a draft electricity policy document seen by Reuters, despite growing calls from environmentalists to deter use of coal.

Coal’s contribution to electricity generation in India fell for the second straight year in 2020, marking a departure from decades of growth in coal-fired power. Still, the fuel accounts for nearly three-fourths of India’s annual power output.

Environmental activists have long rallied against India adding new coal-fired capacity. Solar and wind energy prices are falling to record lows, which would help the world’s third-largest greenhouse gas emitter cut emissions.

U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry this month said India was “getting the job done on climate, pushing the curve,” as he began talks with government leaders aimed at cutting carbon emissions faster to slow global warming.

But a 28-page February draft of the National Electricity Policy (NEP) 2021 - which has not been made public - showed India may add new coal-fired capacity, though it recommended tighter technology standards to reduce pollution.

“While India is committed to add more capacity through non-fossil sources of generation, coal-based generation capacity may still be required to be added in the country as it continues to be the cheapest source of generation,” the NEP draft read.

All future coal-based plants should only deploy so-called “ultra super critical” less polluting technologies “or other more efficient technology”, it added.

State-run NTPC Ltd, India’s top electricity producer, said in September it will not acquire land for new coal-fired projects. Private firms and many run by states across the country have not invested in new coal-fired plants for years saying they were not economically viable.

A source with direct knowledge said a government panel of various power sector experts and officials will discuss the draft and could make changes before seeking cabinet approval.

India’s power ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday.

The draft document also proposed trade of renewable energy in day-ahead markets, creating separate tariffs for electric vehicle charging stations and privatizing electricity distribution companies.

ALTERNATE POWER SOURCES

The NEP 2021 is India’s first attempt at revising its electricity policy enacted in 2005, when the country produced negligible renewable energy.

Experts say phasing in renewable energy sources and phasing out conventional sources such as coal and natural gas rapidly could lead to instability in the electricity grid, potentially causing blackouts.

While suggesting flexible use of coal-fired and natural gas-fired power to ensure grid stability in the coming years, the draft policy lists promoting clean power as its primary objective.

The policy draft suggested expediting adoption of “cost effective” pumped hydro storage to support the electricity grid, adding that only 4.8 gigawatts (GW) of a potential 96.5 GW of pumped storage capacity has been developed so far.

The policy also recommends compensating natural gas-fired plants for operating at reduced efficiency to ensure grid stability, and for suffering higher wear and tear due to fluctuations in generation.",522,3462,13,70
0,Covid variant first detected in India is found in the UK | Coronavirus,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/15/covid-variant-first-detected-india-found-uk,"A coronavirus variant with potentially worrying mutations that was first detected in India has been found in the UK.

In total, 77 cases of the variant, known as B.1.617, have been recorded in the UK up to 14 April, according to the latest update from Public Health England (PHE), released on Thursday. Of these, 73 were recorded in England and four in Scotland.

It was the first time PHE had reported the variant in the UK.

It currently has the label “variant under investigation”. If worries about it are borne out, for example if it appears to be more infectious or more resistant to the body’s immune response, then it may be designated a “variant of concern”.

The UK has a handful of “variants of concern”, including ones first detected in Kent, South Africa and Brazil.

These variants contain a different overall set of mutations, although there are some overlaps. For example all three have a mutation called N501Y, which is believed to make the virus more infectious, while the Brazil and South Africa variants both have a mutation called 484K, which is believed to help the virus at least partially evade the body’s immune responses towards coronavirus – including those produced by some Covid vaccines. This mutation later cropped up in the Kent variant, giving rise to a new variant of concern.

The B.1.617 variant was first detected in India, but has since been found elsewhere, including California. It has worried experts as it contains two mutations in the spike protein that, it has been suggested, may boost its ability to escape the body’s immune responses. It is thought the variant may also be able to infect the body more easily.

Prof Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the arrival of the India variant was potentially worrying.

“These two escape mutations working together could be a lot more problematic than the South African and Brazilian variants who have only got one escape mutation,” he said. “It might be even less controlled by vaccine than the Brazilian and South African variants.”

However, more research is needed to explore the role of these mutations and the impact they might have.

News of the arrival of the India variant in the UK came as surge testing was expanded in London in an attempt to control the spread of coronavirus variants, with parts of Hillingdon, as well as certain postcodes in Lambeth, Wandsworth, Southwark and Barnet all having testing and contact tracing ramped up. Sandwell council in the West Midlands has also announced it will undertake surge testing.

India is experiencing a devastating wave of coronavirus, although it is not clear whether the B.1.617 variant is helping to fuel the surge. Boris Johnson is expected to travel to India later this month, although his trip has been curtailed as a result of the infections there.

Prof Christina Pagel, director of the Clinical Operational Research Unit at University College London and a member of the Independent Sage group of experts, said the discovery of the variant in the UK was worrying, and tweeted that Johnson should not head to Delhi.

“We don’t know yet whether it can escape existing vaccines but it has several concerning mutations,” she told the Guardian. “It is ridiculous that India is not on the travel red list yet – or many other countries for that matter – when India is seeing 200,000 new cases every day at the moment.”",576,3405,13,70

Calls to leave Pakistan fall on deaf ears

The extremist party has orchestrated a monthslong campaign calling for the expulsion of the French ambassador after President Emmanuel Macron defended the right for magazines to publish images of Prophet Muhammad. The TLP and a number of prominent Muslims have deemed the cartoons offensive.

0,Blowing in the wind The war in Tigray is taking a frightful human toll,https://amp.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/04/15/the-war-in-tigray-is-taking-a-frightful-human-toll,"“L IKE FLOUR scattered in the wind” is how Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia’s prime minister, describes the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front ( TPLF ), the ethnically based party that called the shots in Ethiopia for almost three decades. By this he means it is crushed, never to revive. There is no denying that its power has waned. In 2018 the TPLF lost control of the federal government, making way for the ascent of Abiy. Then last November his forces kicked the TPLF out of its seat in the regional government of Tigray, a northern state, killing or capturing some of its leaders and sending the rest into hiding.

Listen to this story Your browser does not support the <audio> element. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.

But Abiy’s description is apt in another way too. His forces are now battling invisible guerrillas whom they are unable completely to subdue. Last year, soon after federal troops entered Mekelle, the Tigrayan capital, Abiy declared victory. Now he admits that defeating “an enemy which is in hiding” will be “very difficult”.

As the war drags on, the human toll mounts. In recent weeks tens of thousands of Tigrayans have fled what American officials have described as ethnic cleansing in western Tigray. Possibly thousands of civilians have been murdered by armed forces on all sides. Women and doctors in Tigray report mass rape by both Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiers. “The conflict is ongoing and human-rights violations are happening every day,” says Finland’s foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, who is the EU ’s special envoy to Ethiopia.

The war’s economic costs are ruinous, too. Life had been improving. Between 2000 and 2016 the share of Ethiopians who could not afford to buy a basket of food containing the minimum number of calories they need fell from 44% to 24%. Such huge gains, made in Africa’s second-most populous country, are now under threat.

Start with the direct costs of reconstruction. Eyob Tolina, Ethiopia’s finance minister, estimates that the price of repairing damaged infrastructure will be around $1bn (about 1% of GDP ). Schools, universities and hospitals have been looted or destroyed, as have farms and factories.

Longer-term costs are harder to quantify, but are piling up. Before the war Tigray produced a third of Ethiopia’s sesame exports, worth almost $350m a year, a tenth of total exports. Since then, tens of thousands of farmers have fled, abandoning the harvest. Although business in Mekelle is slowly picking up, banks and markets in much of the region are still closed. Officials shrug off the economic impact. In January the trade ministry said that the closure of factories and roads in Tigray was losing the country $20m a month in exports. Abiy has since trumpeted a 21% rise in exports, largely thanks to a huge surge in earnings from gold. The government insists that the economy will grow by 8.5% in 2021. The IMF, however , reckons growth will be closer to 2%. The government’s confidence is based on an assumption that the war’s impact will be limited to Tigray, which accounts for less than 10% of the national economy. “Tigray...is a geographically small part of the country,” says a senior government adviser. “Certainly not a big macro issue.” Public debt has fallen by more than a tenth since reaching a peak of almost 60% of GDP three years ago, even after a small rise because of covid-19. But how long can the economy bear a prolonged conflict? Inflation, which was running at 18% before the war, is now above 20%. Foreign exchange is cripplingly scarce. On the black market the Ethiopian birr has fallen by 9% against the dollar in recent months. Businesses trying to get foreign currency through official channels often wait at least a year to get their allocation from state-owned banks.

The government has asked the IMF and the World Bank to bail it out. In February it said it would apply for debt relief under a programme aimed at helping poor countries affected by covid-19. Rating agencies duly downgraded Ethiopia’s debt. The government also hopes to get a windfall from auctioning two new mobile-phone licences and later selling a 45% share of Ethio Telecom, the mobile-phone monopoly.

But relief, whether from lenders or investors, may be slow. Faced with reports of atrocities as well as uncertainty concerning elections, which are planned for June, foreign investors are nervous. “Everything is on hold,” reports one of them. Officials fret that extra support from donors may not be forthcoming. In January the European Union suspended €88m ($107m) of budget support until aid agencies are given full access to Tigray.

Ethiopia also has little room for manoeuvre. Under the terms of an existing IMF programme it cannot easily borrow more. Nor can it just print money. The treasury has been able to finance its deficit by selling treasury bills, mostly to state-owned pension funds (previously it simply forced banks to hold public debt at below-market rates). But the government will face a balance-of-payments crisis unless it can get hard currency to finance imports and service its foreign-denominated debts.

Allies such as China, Russia and, especially, countries in the Gulf may help to plug the gap. Meanwhile the conflict is spreading. People in Tigray are already starving. Mass famine looms. Elsewhere in the country ethnic violence is worsening. In recent weeks hundreds of people have died in clashes between Oromos and Amharas, the country’s two biggest groups, as well as between ethnic Somalis and Afars in the east. Eyob, the finance minister, sounds optimistic, arguing that in recent months the economy has shown “resilience” in the face of the crisis. On the ground, though, the situation looks increasingly dire. ■",952,5749,14,70

It would be the first time that Lai, one of Hong Kong’s most prominent democratic activists, who has been in jail since December after being denied bail in a separate national security trial, will receive a sentence.

ADVERTISEMENT

About 100 people, including foreign diplomats, queued outside the court early on Friday to get a seat for the hearing.

Lai was found guilty in two separate trials earlier in April for illegal assemblies on August 18 and August 31, 2019, respectively. The maximum possible punishment is five years in prison.

His repeated arrests have drawn criticism from Western governments and international rights groups, who raised concerns over waning freedoms in the global financial hub, including freedom of speech and assembly.

In the Aug. 18 case, District Court Judge Amanda Woodcock found him guilty together with Martin Lee, who helped launch the city’s largest opposition Democratic Party in the 1990s and is often called the former British colony’s “father of democracy.”

As he entered the court on Friday, Lee said: “I feel completely relaxed, I’m ready to face my sentence.”

The other defendants, also found guilty, included prominent barrister Margaret Ng and veteran democrats Lee Cheuk-yan, Albert Ho, Leung Kwok-hung, Cyd Ho, Au Nok-hin, and Leung Yiu-chung. The latter two had pleaded guilty.

In her mitigation speech, Ng said the law must not only be defended in courts or the legislature, but also in the streets.

“When the people, in the last resort, had to give collective expression to their anguish and urge the government to respond, protected only by their expectation that the government will respect their rights, I must be prepared to stand with them, stand by them and stand up for them,” she said.

In the second trial, the same judge found Lai and Lee Cheuk-yan guilty together with Yeung Sum. The Aug. 31 clashes were some of Hong Kong’s worst, with police firing tear gas and water cannons at pro-democracy protesters who threw petrol bombs.

All three had pleaded guilty.

Lee Cheuk-yan posted on Facebook late on Thursday that he expected to go to jail but that his mind was “free as the ocean and the sky.”

The 2019 pro-democracy protests were spurred by Beijing’s tightening squeeze on wide-ranging freedoms promised to Hong Kong upon its return to Chinese rule in 1997, and plunged the semi-autonomous city into its biggest crisis since the handover.

Beijing has since consolidated its authoritarian grip on Hong Kong by imposing a sweeping national security law, punishing anything it deems as secession, subversion, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.

Supporters of the law say it has restored stability.

Lai, founder of the Apple Daily tabloid, has been a frequent visitor to Washington, meeting officials such as former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to rally support for Hong Kong democracy, prompting Beijing to label him a “traitor”.

Lai is scheduled for two more court mentions on Friday, in the ongoing trial where he is charged with collusion with a foreign country and a fraud case related to the lease of the building which houses Apple Daily.

Earlier this week, the tabloid published a hand-written letter Lai sent to his colleagues from prison, saying: “It is our responsibility as journalists to seek justice. As long as we are not blinded by unjust temptations, as long as we do not let evil get its way through us, we are fulfilling our responsibility.”

It is “time for us to stand tall,” he wrote.

REUTERS/Ricardo Moraes

The United States and Brazil are at an impasse on a deal to stop destruction of the Amazon rainforest, which has surged under right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

While Brazil wants to receive money upfront to pay for the protection of the world's largest rainforest, the United States is insistent on seeing results first before it opens the purse strings, sources said.

Bolsonaro is expected to attend the high-profile U.S. Earth Day summit that starts April 22.

While former President Donald Trump, a Bolsonaro ally, did not criticize Brazil over its handling of the Amazon, the Biden government has placed the issue at the center of its relations with South America's largest country.

Talks between the two sides began in February with a call between U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry and Brazil's environment and foreign ministers.

Lower-level negotiations since then have focused on the soaring destruction in Brazil's share of the Amazon - a vital bulwark against climate change.

Deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon surged in 2019 after Bolsonaro took office and hit a 12-year high in 2020 when an area 14 times the size of New York City was destroyed, according to government data.

""We would hope to see a very clear commitment to ending illegal deforestation, tangible steps to increase the effective enforcement of illegal deforestation, and a political signal that illegal deforestation and encroachment will not be tolerated,"" a State Department spokesperson said in a statement when asked about the talks.

""We believe it is realistic for Brazil to achieve a real decrease in deforestation by the end of the 2021 fire season.""

The spokesperson said the United States hoped Bolsonaro would use the summit to demonstrate his seriousness about climate and the Amazon.

Brazil's foreign ministry in a statement said the meetings were exploratory and not formal negotiations.

The ministry said its efforts to combat deforestation since 2006 have avoided billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions that if properly compensated would have a value of $30 billion to $40 billion.

To effectively combat deforestation, ""large resources are needed, especially from international cooperation,"" the ministry said.

A central impasse in negotiations remains on when the United States would pay Brazil.

Environment Minister Ricardo Salles, who is leading the Brazilian negotiators, has publicly asked for $1 billion in foreign aid in advance, that potentially could come from the United States with other partners. One of the sources confirmed that request has been made in the talks.

Salles told Brazilian newspaper O Estado de S.Paulo this month that upon receiving that money, Brazil could lower deforestation by 30%-40% in a span of 12 months.

Without money up front, he said Brazil would not be able to set a hard target.

But U.S. officials want to pay only once there are results. That includes a decline in deforestation this year, the two sources familiar with the negotiations said.

Bolsonaro appeared to meet one of the U.S. demands on Wednesday, with newspaper Folha de S.Paulo reporting he had sent a letter to Biden affirming that Brazil would end illegal deforestation by 2030.

That target was part of Brazil's Paris agreement commitment made under the left-wing government of former President Dilma Rousseff, leaving doubts over whether Bolsonaro was working towards it.

A deal nevertheless seems unlikely by next week.

“I would not bet money on it,” one of the sources told Reuters. “It’s not that there’s been a lack of interest: it’s just that I don’t think there has been enough time to discuss a specific deal.”

0,China To Build More Bio Labs Amid Scrutiny Over Wuhan Facility On Covid,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/china-to-build-more-bio-labs-amid-scrutiny-over-wuhan-facility-on-covid-2415488,"A team of WHO experts probed the origin of the coronavirus in Wuhan. (File)

China has operationalised its new biosecurity law to fortify the legal cover for the establishment and safe operation of more bio labs in the country amidst questions whether the COVID-19 originated from such a laboratory in Wuhan.

The coronavirus emerged in China's central Wuhan city in December 2019 and became a pandemic, upending life across the globe.

Under the new Biosecurity Law, China will continue to build and approve more labs specialising in advanced pathogenic microbiology with a scrupulous and scientific manner, the country's Deputy Minister of Science and Technology Xiang Libin said.

China will carry out major scientific research to enhance its biosecurity science and technological capacity against future infectious diseases, state-run Global Times quoted Xiang as saying.

The ministry has examined and approved the construction of three biosafety level-4 labs, or P4 labs, and 88 biosafety level-3 labs, or P3 labs, in China, he said.

A biosafety level (BSL), or pathogen/protection level, is a set of biocontainment precautions required to isolate dangerous biological agents in an enclosed laboratory facility.

The levels of containment range from the lowest biosafety level 1 (BSL-1) to the highest at level 4 (BSL-4).

Bai Chunli, president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said in April last year that China had two P4 labs besides 81 P3 labs in operation or approved for construction.

In contrast, the US has 12 P4 and 1,500 P3 labs, the Global Times report said.

Bio labs acquired significance as the US has alleged that the COVID-19 may have emanated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) which is a P-4 bio lab. China has strongly denied the charge.

A team of WHO experts, which probed the origin of the coronavirus, concluded last month that ""all hypotheses"" included the allegation that COVID-19 could have emanated from a bio lab ""remained open"".

World Health Organisation (WHO) Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, while receiving the report of the international experts' team which visited Wuhan, said on March 30 that ""as far as the WHO is concerned, all hypotheses remain on the table"".

""This report is a very important beginning, but it is not the end. We have not yet found the source of the virus, and we must continue to follow the science and leave no stone unturned as we do,"" he said.

Significantly, Mr Ghebreyesus said the team has concluded that leak from the WIV as alleged by former US president Donald Trump is the ""least likely hypothesis"" but it requires further probe.

""The team also visited several laboratories in Wuhan and considered the possibility that the virus entered the human population as a result of a laboratory incident.""

""However, I do not believe that this assessment was extensive enough. Further data and studies will be needed to reach more robust conclusions,"" he said.

""Although the team has concluded that a laboratory leak is the least likely hypothesis, this requires further investigation, potentially with additional missions involving specialist experts, which I am ready to deploy,"" the WHO chief added.

Yang Zhanqiu, deputy director of the pathogen biology department at Wuhan University, told the Global Times on Thursday that the law on biosafety is a timely move for China to detail the construction and management of biosafety labs and provide a legal shield for scientific projects on biosafety, including infectious diseases, to be carried out in a scrupulous and professional manner.

According to John Hopkins coronavirus tracker, China has so far reported 102,152 cases and 4,845 deaths. Globally the contagion has infected 139,228,122 people and killed 29,89,103, it said.

0,Microplastics Are Now Spiralling Around The Globe in The Air We Breathe,https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-are-now-spiralling-around-the-globe-in-the-air-we-breathe,"Our plastic pollution problem has become so bad that microplastics are now embedded in the regular cycles of the atmosphere, circulating around the planet like oxygen or water, according to a new study.

Plastic particles sent up into the air from ocean spray and road surfaces travel across continents and reaching the most remote spots on Earth, according to a mix of sampling and modeling done by researchers.

Much of this plastic appears to have been circulating through our ecosystems for a long time – highlighting just how much of a massive clean up operation we've got on our hands if we're to reverse the plastic tide.

""We found a lot of legacy plastic pollution everywhere we looked,"" says geological scientist Janice Brahney from Utah State University. ""It travels in the atmosphere and it deposits all over the world.""

""This plastic is not new from this year. It's from what we've already dumped into the environment over several decades.""

Between December 2017 and January 2019, researchers collected 313 samples of airborne microplastics from 11 different sites across the western US. They found that 84 percent of the plastic particles came from road dust, 11 percent originated from sea spray, 5 percent came from agricultural soil, and 0.4 percent was put down to population sources.

In other words, this is mainly plastic that has been ground down on roads or whipped up from garbage patches in the ocean. Microplastic pollution isn't just concentrated around urban areas – it's getting everywhere, carried on the wind.

The findings were then plugged into a computer model to try and figure out what the worldwide pattern of atmospheric plastics might look like. Time spent in the air for the particles could range from an hour to almost a week, the team deduced – long enough for the plastic to travel the continents.

While the remote wilderness of Antarctica isn't exporting any airborne microplastics, it's very likely to be importing them, the model showed – and it's a similar story across the planet. Microplastics are accumulating just about everywhere scientists look, including national parks, with the highest concentrations estimated to be over the oceans.

""Using our best estimate of plastic sources and modeled transport pathways, most continents are net importers of microplastics from the marine environment,"" says Natalie Mahowald from Cornell University. ""This underscores the cumulative role of legacy pollution in the atmospheric burden of plastic.""

While the modeling part of the study uses some guesses and estimations to map out airborne microplastics on a global scale, there's little doubt that these polluting particles are very much blowing in the wind.

To date, nearly 10 billion metric tons of plastic have been produced globally since the early 1900s, and it's estimated that between 12-18 percent of it isn't accounted for by landfills, recycling, or incinerating.

The team behind this latest study is calling for more research into where all of this plastic ends up and how it might be distributed worldwide – affecting ecosystems, wildlife, the food chain, and ultimately our health.

""We did the modeling to find out the sources, not knowing what the sources might be,"" says Mahowald. ""It's amazing that this much plastic is in the atmosphere at that level, and unfortunately accumulating in the oceans and on land and just recirculating and moving everywhere, including remote places.""

The research has been published in PNAS.",562,3490,12,71

Prime Minister Andrej Babis said at a Prague news conference that his government would respond by expelling 18 Russian diplomats, whom it had identified as spies. He said there was “clear evidence,” assembled by the Czech intelligence and security services, showing “reasonable suspicion” that the Russian group, known as Unit 29155, had been involved in the blasts in late 2014, which killed two Czechs.

The announcement underscored the breadth of Russia’s efforts to expand its influence and pursue aggressive actions around the world, including military-style operations, assassinations and cyberattacks.

The elite Russian unit has operated for at least a decade, focusing on subversion, sabotage and assassination beyond Russia’s borders. It first came to light after the March 2018 attack in Salisbury, England, on a turncoat Russian ex-spy, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia, using the nerve agent Novichok.

Now the third wave has hit Poland and the number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care stands at 17, with just four non-COVID sufferers. Around 80% of the COVID patients are expected to die.

Szlachcic-Wyroba, however, is still working with only three other doctors.

""We are physically doing our best but we are frequently unable to secure the care that we would like to provide,"" she said in the ward's break room for staff, lined with couches and a stray sleeping bag, adding that when on shift they often can't even take a break to sit down.

As COVID-related deaths in Poland surpass 800 a day and the country hits a European record for excess deaths, epidemiologists have pointed to a major medical personnel shortage as one of the culprits.

Szlachcic-Wyroba is exhausted from 24-hour shifts and comforting patients' families, adding that the flood of critically ill patients in recent weeks surpassed ""even my worst dreams"".

Across Poland, doctors have complained about long lines of ambulances at hospitals or rescheduled non-COVID surgeries for life-threatening illnesses.

""The country was unprepared for this scale of an epidemic... There are no beds, no personnel, simply no reserves,"" said professor Krzysztof Simon, a regional epidemiology consultant from Lower Silesia.

According to Eurostat, Poland had only 2.4 doctors and 5.1 nurses per 1,000 citizens in 2017, among the lowest in the EU, even before the pandemic.

Many doctors have gone abroad in search of better pay, with health spending not enough to attract or retain staff.

""The healthcare system is now at its limit but it has been at this limit basically for as long as I can remember. The epidemic has just multiplied all of its shortcomings,"" said Piotr Meryk, head doctor at the Zeromski hospital's COVID ward.

That means deaths have spiked this year, doctors say, as COVID patients are reluctant to go to hospital, fearing poor conditions and patients suffering from other serious illnesses are neglected by specialists relocated to COVID wards.

After Brazil, Poland had the second highest cumulative number of confirmed deaths in the world the week of April 13, according to Our World in Data.

SOLUTIONS?

The government has promised to address the issue, but staff are hard to find despite efforts to recruit medical students and Ukrainian doctors.

""You can buy equipment, build temporary hospitals, produce more beds, but personnel is the element that is creating a bottleneck,"" Health Minister Adam Niedzielski said in February.

In a statement to Reuters, the ministry said it had taken legislative steps in recent years to recruit more nurses and doctors.

But as patients flood wards, Meryk said these steps were not enough, and he urged the government to prepare for future pandemics.

""You can't just make these doctors appear or clone them.""

Islamabad (AFP)

Western governments should treat people who insult the Prophet Mohammed the same as those who deny the Holocaust, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said Saturday.

Speaking after a week of violent protests in Pakistan by a radical Islamist party outraged by French government support for magazines publishing cartoons of Mohammed, Khan said insulting the prophet hurt Muslims around the world.

""We Muslims have the greatest love & respect for our Prophet,"" he tweeted.

""We cannot tolerate any such disrespect & abuse.""

The group Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) was banned Thursday after days of violent protests during which four policemen were killed.

The radical party has orchestrated a months-long campaign for the expulsion of the French ambassador to protest against President Emmanuel Macron's defence of the cartoons' publication.

The French embassy in Islamabad on Thursday recommended its nationals leave Pakistan, a call that appears to have gone largely unheeded.

""I... call on Western govts who have outlawed any negative comment on the holocaust to use the same standards to penalise those deliberately spreading their message of hate against Muslims by abusing our Prophet,"" Khan tweeted.

Denying the Holocaust is illegal in several European countries -- including Germany and France -- and offenders can be jailed.

Khan suggested the government had not banned the TLP because it disagreed with TLP's motivation, but rather its methods.

""Let me make clear to people here & abroad: Our govt only took action against TLP under our anti-terrorist law when they challenged the writ of the state and used street violence & attacking the public & law enforcers,"" he said.

""No one can be above the law and the Constitution.""

His comments were made public Thursday but were taped April 1.

Bourla said it's possible people will need to get vaccinated against the coronavirus annually.

""A likely scenario is that there will be likely a need for a third dose, somewhere between six and 12 months and then from there, there will be an annual revaccination, but all of that needs to be confirmed. And again, the variants will play a key role,"" he told CNBC's Bertha Coombs during an event with CVS Health.

""It is extremely important to suppress the pool of people that can be susceptible to the virus,"" Bourla said.

The comment comes after Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky told CNBC in February that people may need to get vaccinated against Covid-19 annually, just like seasonal flu shots.

Researchers still don't know how long protection against the virus lasts once someone has been fully vaccinated.

Pfizer said earlier this month that its Covid-19 vaccine was more than 91% effective at protecting against the coronavirus and more than 95% effective against severe disease up to six months after the second dose. Moderna's vaccine, which uses technology similar to Pfizer's, was also shown to be highly effective at six months.

Pfizer's data was based on more than 12,000 vaccinated participants. However, researchers say more data is still needed to determine whether protection lasts after six months.",251,1524,12,71

Australia closed its borders to all non-citizens and non-residents in March 2020 and has been permitting only limited international arrivals in recent months, mainly its citizens returning from abroad.

The border closure, together with snap lockdowns, swift contact tracking and high community compliance with health measures, have made Australia one of the world’s most successful countries in curbing the pandemic, limiting coronavirus cases to under 29,500 infections and 910 deaths.

“Australia is in no hurry to open those borders, I assure you,” Morrison said at a televised briefing.

“I will not be putting at risk the way we are living in this country which is so different to the rest of the world today.”

For months now, except for some short snap lockdowns, Australians have been able to dine out, gather nearly freely and stop wearing face masks in most places.

They exchanged their international forays for local trips, with government figures showing big annual increases in intra-state travel in the first months of 2021.

From Monday, Australians and neighbouring New Zealanders will be able to travel between both countries without the need to apply for an exemption or spend time in mandatory quarantine.

New Zealand has had only 2,239 confirmed coronavirus cases and 26 related deaths.

Morrison flagged on Sunday that vaccinated Australians could be able travel overseas “for essential purposes” and return via home quarantine in the second half of the year, but that possibility is only in “planning stages”.

0,They ‘Bombed My Dream’: Denmark Strips Some Syrians of Residency Status,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/world/europe/denmark-syrian-residence-permits.html,"Most of the 34,000 Syrians who have obtained residence permits in Denmark since the war began in their country in 2011 have not had their residency reviewed. Yet the move to strip hundreds of their legal status is the latest in a series of measures by Denmark that rights groups say have targeted migrants and minorities.

The authorities have imposed mandatory instruction in “Danish values” for children in low-income and heavily Muslim neighborhoods that the government labeled “ghettos,” and doubled punishments for certain crimes in these areas.

They have also overhauled the country’s legal apparatus on immigration, shifting it from integration to the accelerated return of refugees to their native countries. Hundreds of Somali refugees have also lost their residence permits after Denmark deemed Somalia safe to return to.

Per Mouritsen, an associate professor of political science at Aarhus University, said the government had toughened its stance on immigration in recent years to avoid losing votes to the right wing, a dilemma that several center-left parties across Europe have faced.

“The only way to beat the right-wing in Denmark is to sell your soul to the devil and be as tough on immigration in order to have support for social welfare policies in return,” Mr. Mouritsen said.

Last year, the number of refugees leaving Denmark exceeded the number of arrivals. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has vowed to go further, saying that Denmark will aim to have “zero asylum seekers.”",239,1501,11,71

The releases were announced on the state broadcaster, MRTV, which said the junta chief, Min Aung Hlaing, had pardoned 23,047 prisoners, including 137 foreigners who will be deported. He also reduced sentences for others.

It comes as daily protests against the 1 February ousting of the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi continue, as does the use of deadly force against them.

According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which monitors casualties and arrests, government forces have killed at least 728 protesters and bystanders since the takeover. The group says 3,141 people, including Aung San Suu Kyi, are in detention.

Unconfirmed but credible accounts with photos on social media claimed three people were killed on Saturday by security forces in a violent crackdown in the central city of Mogok, in Myanmar’s gem-mining region.

Detainees released on Saturday from Insein prison in Yangon included at least three political prisoners jailed in 2019, said witnesses and local reports.

The three are members of the Peacock Generation performance troupe who were arrested during that year’s new year celebrations for skits that poked fun at military representatives in parliament and military involvement in business.

Their traditional style of acting is called Thangyat, a mashup of poetry, comedy and music with a sharp undertone of satire. Several members of the troupe were convicted under a law banning circulation of information that could endanger or demoralise members of the military. The actors may have particularly angered the military because they performed in army uniforms.

Several members were also found guilty of online defamation for livestreaming their performances. It could not be ascertained if all imprisoned members of the troupe were released.

Another freed prisoner was Ross Dunkley, an Australian newspaper entrepreneur sentenced in 2019 to 13 years in prison for drug possession. His release was confirmed by his ex-wife, Cynda Johnston, reported the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper.

Dunkley co-founded the Myanmar Times, an English-language daily, but was forced to give up his share in it. He became well-known for co-founding or acquiring English-language publications in formerly socialist states that were seeking foreign investment as they liberalised their economies, but was sometimes criticised for doing business with authoritarian regimes.

Early prisoner releases are customary during major holidays in Myanmar and this is the second batch the ruling junta has announced since taking power.

After the release of more than 23,000 convicts to mark Union Day on 12 February, there were reports on social media that some were recruited by the authorities to carry out violence at night in residential areas to spread panic, especially by setting fires. Some areas responded by setting up their own neighbourhood watch groups.

In March, more than 600 people who were imprisoned for protesting against the February coup were released from Insein prison, a rare conciliatory gesture by the military that appeared aimed at placating the protest movement.

Those freed were mostly young people caught up in sweeps of street demonstrations, while those considered protest leaders were kept locked up.

Neither the military government nor those opposed to it show any signs of backing off from their struggle for power. Western nations have tried to pressure the military through diplomatic and economic sanctions with little effect.

Myanmar’s south-east Asian neighbours, concerned about regional instability, are trying to get the junta on the path to restoring democracy, or at least end its violent repression.

A spokesperson for Thailand’s foreign ministry said Min Aung Hlaing had confirmed he would attend a summit meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations on 24 April.

Tanee Sangrat said in a text message to journalists that Brunei, the current chair of the 10-nation body, confirmed it had proposed the date for a meeting at the group’s secretariat in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.

President Biden is ordering a new round of economic sanctions on Russia — a response in part to Moscow's election meddling and a Kremlin-linked computer breach that penetrated numerous U.S. government networks.

Biden said Thursday that the United States isn't pushing for ""a cycle of escalation and conflict"" with Russia, but instead for both nations to manage tensions and work together when needed.

But the president also said that during a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, he made it clear that any actions taken against the United States would be met with proportionate repercussions.

""My bottom line is this, where it is in the interest of the United States to work with Russia, we should and we will. If Russia seeks to violate the interests of the United States, we will respond,"" Biden said. ""We will always stand in defense of our country, our institutions, our people and our allies.""

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday afternoon that ""our objective here is not to escalate, our objective is to impose costs for what we feel are unacceptable actions by the Russian government.""

The sanctions are also meant to impose a penalty over Russia's continued occupation of Crimea, which it infiltrated and annexed from Ukraine seven years ago, and for reportedly offering bounties for attacks against U.S. and coalition military personnel in Afghanistan.

Psaki said that while the U.S. believes with ""low to moderate confidence"" that bounties were offered by Russia, ""we had enough concern about these reports that we wanted to have our intelligence community look into them.""

""We still feel there are questions to be answered by the Russian government,"" she added.

She said the sanctions signal that ""we are going to be clear to Russia that there will be consequences when warranted.""

On the possibility of a Biden-Putin summit at some point in the future, Psaki said that ""the invitation remains open.""

The Kremlin has denied any involvement in U.S. elections or on offering the bounties. Moscow has also said it had nothing to do with the SolarWinds computer attack.

Speaking after the measures were made official, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the ""aggressive behavior"" would lead to an ""inevitable"" response and that the U.S. would ""pay"" for the deterioration in relations.

""The United States is not ready to come to terms with the objective reality that there is a multipolar world that excludes American hegemony,"" Zakharova said.

In December, reports emerged that U.S. technology firm SolarWinds had been hit by a cyberattack that went undetected for months as the company sent out software updates with the hackers' code to its clients worldwide. The attack — first identified by cybersecurity firm FireEye when its own systems were found to have been compromised — later allowed hackers to infiltrate U.S. government networks, including those used by the Homeland Security and Treasury departments.

National security adviser Jake Sullivan, speaking with CNN on Thursday, said that the White House believes the sanctions ""are proportionate measures to defend American interests in response to harmful Russia actions, including cyber intrusions and election interference.""

A fact sheet released by the White House on Thursday morning said, ""The Biden administration has been clear that the United States desires a relationship with Russia that is stable and predictable.""

""We do not think that we need to continue on a negative trajectory,"" it said. ""However, we have also been clear — publicly and privately —that we will defend our national interests and impose costs for Russian Government actions that seek to harm us.""

According to the White House, the latest sanctions target more than 30 Russian entities and individuals it said are involved in election meddling. The U.S. is expelling 10 personnel from the Russian diplomatic mission from the country. The sanctions target six Russian tech firms believed to provide support to Russian intelligence.

The sanctions also include a prohibition on U.S. financial institutions participating in the trade of bonds used by the Russian government after June 14. They leave open the possibility ""to expand sovereign debt sanctions on Russia as appropriate.""

On CNN, Sullivan said that in a telephone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this week, Biden made clear that ""his goal is provide a significant and credible response, but not to escalate the situation.""

""We believe that altogether, both the actions we are taking today and that broader diplomacy, can produce a better set of outcomes for U.S.-Russia relations,"" Sullivan said.

Senior administration officials, speaking to reporters on background, said the U.S. has ""no desire to be in an escalatory cycle with Russia"" and that the sanctions are intended to be ""proportionate and tailored"" to the Kremlin's past actions.

While the latest sanctions are meant as a response to Russia's meddling in the 2020 presidential election, they follow on from Obama-era sanctions that called out the Kremlin for similar interference in the 2016 presidential race.

Former President Donald Trump repeatedly downplayed or denied any Russian involvement in the 2016 election, calling the accusation a ""witch hunt"" and a ""hoax.""

A U.S. intelligence report released last month confirmed that Russia sought once again to aid Trump in last year's election.

India breached 200,000 daily infections for the first time on Thursday, and is trying to inoculate more of its population using domestically produced shots.

Facing soaring cases and overflowing hospitals after lockdown restrictions were eased, it also abruptly changed the rules to allow it to fast-track vaccine imports, having earlier rebuffed foreign drugmakers like Pfizer.

It will import Russia's Sputnik V vaccine starting this month to cover as many as 125 million people.

The reversal in fortunes could hamper not only India's battle to contain the pandemic, but also vaccination campaigns in more than 60 poorer countries, mainly in Africa, for months.

The COVAX programme, backed by the World Health Organization and Gavi vaccine alliance, aims at equitable vaccine access around the world, and is relying heavily on supplies from India, Asia's pharmaceutical powerhouse.

But so far this month India has only exported around 1.2 million vaccine doses. That compares with 64 million doses shipped abroad between late January and March, according to data from the foreign ministry.

An official with knowledge of India's vaccine strategy said that available shots would be used domestically while the country faced an ""emergency situation"".

""There is no commitment to other countries,"" he said.

India's foreign ministry, which oversees vaccine deals with other countries, said last week that Indian demand would dictate the level of exports.

Resulting shortages are already being felt in some countries in the COVAX scheme, and a U.N. health official involved in the vaccine rollout in Africa said: ""To be so reliant on one manufacturer is a massive concern.""

The director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, said earlier this month delays in supplies from India could be ""catastrophic"".

MISSTEPS

Four sources involved in discussions on vaccine supplies and procurement said factors including delays by India and COVAX in placing firm orders, a lack of investment in production, raw material shortages and underestimating the coronavirus surge at home had contributed to vaccine shortages.

The Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's biggest vaccine manufacturer, had vowed to deliver at least 2 billion COVID-19 shots to low and middle-income countries, with nearly half of that by the end of 2021.

But it has also come under pressure to meet the needs of other governments, including Britain, Canada and Saudi Arabia, amid AstraZeneca's global production problems.

The United States, meanwhile, ring-fenced the supply of key equipment and raw materials for its own vaccine makers, limiting SII's operations and delaying by months its goal of raising monthly output to 100 million from up to 70 million now, said one of the sources.

A further initial hurdle to SII's supply ambitions was India's hesitation in placing firm orders, two sources said.

That could have allowed it to boost output of the AstraZeneca vaccine early, even though regulators had yet to approve it.

India spent months discussing the final price per dose, and inked an initial purchase order roughly two weeks after India's drug regulator approved the AstraZeneca shot, according to the sources.

At one point, SII ran out of space to store produced doses.

""That is why I chose not to pack more than 50 million doses, because I knew if I packed more than that, I would have to store it in my house,"" SII Chief Executive Adar Poonawalla told Reuters in January.

He said he had spent 20 billion rupees ($272 million) on the 50 million doses that the company started stockpiling since around October.

Even now, the government only makes ad-hoc purchases from SII instead of agreeing a longer-term supply schedule, said one of the sources.

SII has sought more than $400 million from the government to increase capacity, but no commitment has yet been made.

The health department and foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment on issues of funding, purchasing delays and other aspects of India's vaccination rollout.

COVAX CONUNDRUM

COVAX also did not green-light shipments to participating countries from SII until after the shot received WHO clearance in mid-February, said a source involved in the COVAX initiative.

The source said those delays meant tens of millions of additional doses that the SII could have produced between October and February never materialised.

Gavi defended its decision to wait for proper approvals before going ahead with firm orders. And while it is looking for more suppliers, it conceded that much still depended on India's vaccine makers who account for some 60% of global supplies.

COVAX has a deal to buy 1 billion-plus doses from the SII. But it has received less than a fifth of the 100 million or so doses of the SII-made AstraZeneca vaccine it had expected by May. SII is also supposed to make millions of doses of the Novavax shot for COVAX.

Gavi had hoped SII would fully resume vaccine deliveries to COVAX in May, but on Wednesday it said India's COVID-19 crisis could affect that.

""We understand the ferocity of the virus in India at the current time, nevertheless we hope and expect deliveries to resume as soon as possible,"" it said in an email to Reuters.

On Thursday India reported 200,739 infections over the past 24 hours, a seventh daily record in the last eight days, while 1,038 deaths took its toll to 173,123. Its tally of 14.1 million infections is second only to the United States.

Having originally aimed to cover 300 million of its highest-risk people by August, or just over a fifth of its 1.35 billion population, the government has now expanded that by another 100 million, with the promise to widen it further.

Twelve of Europe’s leading football clubs have today come together to announce they have agreed to establish a new mid-week competition, the Super League, governed by its Founding Clubs.

AC Milan, Arsenal FC, Atlético de Madrid, Chelsea FC, FC Barcelona, FC Internazionale Milano, Juventus FC, Liverpool FC, Manchester City, Manchester United, Real Madrid CF and Tottenham Hotspur have all joined as Founding Clubs. It is anticipated that a further three clubs will join ahead of the inaugural season, which is intended to commence as soon as practicable.

Going forward, the Founding Clubs look forward to holding discussions with UEFA and FIFA to work together in partnership to deliver the best outcomes for the new League and for football as a whole.

The formation of the Super League comes at a time when the global pandemic has accelerated the instability in the existing European football economic model. Further, for a number of years, the Founding Clubs have had the objective of improving the quality and intensity of existing European competitions throughout each season, and of creating a format for top clubs and players to compete on a regular basis.

The pandemic has shown that a strategic vision and a sustainable commercial approach are required to enhance value and support for the benefit of the entire European football pyramid. In recent months extensive dialogue has taken place with football stakeholders regarding the future format of European competitions. The Founding Clubs believe the solutions proposed following these talks do not solve fundamental issues, including the need to provide higher-quality matches and additional financial resources for the overall football pyramid.

Competition Format

20 participating clubs with 15 Founding Clubs and a qualifying mechanism for a further five teams to qualify annually based on achievements in the prior season.

Midweek fixtures with all participating clubs continuing to compete in their respective national leagues, preserving the traditional domestic match calendar which remains at the heart of the club game.

An August start with clubs participating in two groups of ten, playing home and away fixtures, with the top three in each group automatically qualifying for the quarter finals. Teams finishing fourth and fifth will then compete in a two-legged play-off for the remaining quarter-final positions. A two-leg knockout format will be used to reach the final at the end of May, which will be staged as a single fixture at a neutral venue.

As soon as practicable after the start of the men’s competition, a corresponding women’s league will also be launched, helping to advance and develop the women’s game.

The new annual tournament will provide significantly greater economic growth and support for European football via a long-term commitment to uncapped solidarity payments which will grow in line with league revenues. These solidarity payments will be substantially higher than those generated by the current European competition and are expected to be in excess of €10 billion during the course of the initial commitment period of the Clubs. In addition, the competition will be built on a sustainable financial foundation with all Founding Clubs signing up to a spending framework. In exchange for their commitment, Founding Clubs will receive an amount of €3.5 billion solely to support their infrastructure investment plans and to offset the impact of the COVID pandemic.

Florentino Pérez, President Real Madrid CF and the first Chairman of the Super League said:

“We will help football at every level and take it to its rightful place in the world. Football is the only global sport in the world with more than four billion fans and our responsibility as big clubs is to respond to their desires.”

Backing the new European league, Andrea Agnelli, Chairman of Juventus and Vice-Chairman of the Super League said:

“Our 12 Founder clubs represent billions of fans across the globe and 99 European trophies. We have come together at this critical moment, enabling European competition to be transformed, putting the game we love on a sustainable footing for the long-term future, substantially increasing solidarity, and giving fans and amateur players a regular flow of headline fixtures that will feed their passion for the game while providing them with engaging role models.”

Joel Glazer, Co-Chairman of Manchester United and Vice-Chairman of the Super League said:

“By bringing together the world’s greatest clubs and players to play each other throughout the season, the Super League will open a new chapter for European football, ensuring world-class competition and facilities, and increased financial support for the wider football pyramid.”",754,4828,9,71

REUTERS/Issei Kato

Japan's financially challenged Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) is expected to show off a new ""must-succeed"" car and explain its green-car strategy for China at the Shanghai auto show which starts on Monday, two company officials told Reuters.

The car Nissan plans to show off at the motor show is the significantly redesigned X-Trail sport-utility vehicle (SUV). A similar SUV called the Rogue hit the U.S. market last year. The new X-Trail will be available in China later this year.

The new car is powered by a fuel-sipping three-cylinder, petrol-powered turbo engine, which one of the sources said might face an uphill battle in gaining acceptance in China where similar technologies have proven unpopular.

The car is a ""must succeed, a must win car for us,"" one of the two sources said. Both sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak with reporters.

In addition to the X-Trail's China debut, Nissan's chief operating officer Ashwani Gupta is expected to tell reporters in Shanghai virtually from Japan on Monday that Nissan's green car strategy is two-pronged: the company will focus on fuel efficiency-enhancing petrol-electric hybrid technology, as well as battery electric cars to make its lineup of vehicles in China greener.

In January, Nissan said all its new vehicles in key markets, including China, would be electrified by the early 2030s, as part of its efforts to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

The strategy comes as regulatory pressure in China grows on carmakers to slash emissions.

China is a key pillar of Nissan's turnaround strategy, which involves focusing on producing profitable cars for China, Japan and the United States, rather than chasing all-out global growth pursued by ousted boss Carlos Ghosn.

The company is scrambling to slash its production capacity and model line-up by a fifth and to cut fixed costs by 300 billion yen ($2.8 billion). Nissan aims to achieve a 5% operating profit margin and a sustainable global market share of 6% by the end of fiscal year 2023

It wasn't immediately clear how much detail Nissan plans to share on its China strategy on Monday.

The two sources said Nissan nonetheless plans to start taking ""pre-orders"" in China for its upcoming electric Ariya SUV before the end of this year.

Nissan also plans to launch a hybrid ""e-Power"" version of the Sylphy compact car this year and an e-Power X-Trail as early as next year.

A company spokeswoman said Nissan plans to showcase in Shanghai the redesign X-Trail crossover, as well as the introduction of Nissan's e-power petrol-electric hybrid technology to China. She declined to comment otherwise.

0,U.S. has new intel that Manafort pal gave Trump campaign data to Russia,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/u-s-has-new-intel-manafort-friend-kilimnik-gave-trump-n1264371?cid=ed_npd_bn_tw_bn,"The U.S. intelligence community has developed new information about Konstantin Kilimnik, whom they call a Russian spy, that leads them to believe the associate of ex-Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort passed internal Trump campaign polling and strategy information to Russian intelligence services, two U.S. officials say.

On Thursday the U.S. Treasury sanctioned Kilimnik and for the first time said he passed along the data to Russian intelligence services.

That new detail, part of a factsheet released by Treasury, was not included in the 2019 report by special counsel Robert Mueller, who was tasked with investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

Mueller's team said in its report that Kilimnik was believed to “have ties to Russian intelligence,” and that Kilimnik had received the Trump campaign information from Manafort, but did not say what he did with it after receiving it.

A bipartisan report by the Senate Intelligence Committee in 2020 said coordination between the Trump campaign and a Russian operation to hack and leak Democratic emails may have existed through Kilimnik but could not be established with certainty. The report drew no conclusions about what the Russians ultimately did with the data.

The officials did not disclose when or how the U.S. came into possession of the new intelligence about Kilimnik, including whether or not the information was developed during the Trump or Biden administrations. The officials did not identify the source or type of intelligence that had been developed.

A spokesperson for the U.S. Treasury declined to comment.

In 2019, Mueller’s team authored a report that detailed the connection between Kilimnik and his former employer in Ukraine, Paul Manafort. Manafort was the Trump campaign chairman from the spring of 2016 until August 2016, when multiple press reports about his work in Ukraine and money he received there led to him stepping down. Manafort was working for the Trump campaign without pay.

Manafort was indicted by Mueller’s team and pleaded guilty in federal court to obstruction of justice and conspiracy. A judge found he had broken his plea agreement by lying to investigators on several issues, including his contacts with Kilimnik. He was convicted of additional charges in a separate case. He later received a presidential pardon from Trump.

According to Mueller, Manafort met with Kilimnik in New York on Aug. 2, 2016 and “months before that meeting, Manafort had caused internal polling data to be shared with Kilimnik, and the sharing continued for some period of time after their August meeting.”

Court documents show that some of that information was shared through former Manafort business partner and member of the Trump campaign, Rick Gates.

Ultimately, the Mueller report concluded, “because of questions about Manafort's credibility and our limited ability to gather evidence on what happened to the polling data after it was sent to Kilimnik, the Office could not assess what Kilimnik (or others he may have given it to) did with it.”

The Senate report released last August said Kilimnik is a Russian intelligence officer who may have had links to the hack-and-leak operation of the GRU, Russia's military intelligence agency, which hacked the emails of prominent Democrats and provided them to WikiLeaks in 2016.

The report includes three bulleted items that were redacted before release. The report says the redacted information ""suggests that a channel for coordination on the GRU hack-and-leak operation may have existed through Kilimnik, [but] the Committee had limited insight into Kilimnik's communications with Manafort and [REDACTED], all of whom used sophisticated communications security practices.""

So far, U.S. officials have not said publicly — or said if they know — what Russian intelligence services did with the data they received, or if the information provided had any impact on Russia’s attempts to interfere in the 2016 election.

Navalny's right-hand man Leonid Volkov says a massive rally is planned on Wednesday evening ""not just about Kremlin critic's freedom, but his life"" after his doctors said he could die any minute as his health deteriorates rapidly in prison.

The team of jailed Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny called for massive protests across Russia next week to help save the life of the hunger-striking opposition leader, who doctors warn could die in a matter of days.

Navalny is President Vladimir Putin's most prominent opponent and the street protests are to be held just hours after the Kremlin chief is set to deliver his long-awaited state of nation address on Wednesday.

""It's to time to act. We are talking not just about Navalny's freedom but his life,"" Navalny's right-hand man Leonid Volkov said on Facebook.

Volkov said Wednesday's rally, set for 7PM local time, could become a decisive battle against ""absolute evil"" or Russia's last opposition rally for years to come.

""Call on all your acquaintances and take to central squares,"" wrote Volkov, who heads Navalny's regional offices, adding that the protests should be massive.

""Don't think that nothing depends on us.""

Authorities have ramped up pressure on Navalny's supporters in recent months, detaining more than 10,000 protesters at opposition demonstrations in January and February.

US warns of 'consequences'

The 44-year-old Russian began a hunger strike on March 31 to demand proper medical treatment for back pain and numbness in his legs and hands.

On Saturday, Navalny's doctors said his health had rapidly deteriorated and demanded prison officials grant them immediate access.

""Our patient can die any minute,"" cardiologist Yaroslav Ashikhmin said, pointing to Navalny's high potassium levels and saying he should be moved to intensive care.

Both France and Germany on Sunday joined a growing international chorus of protest at Navalny's treatment.

US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan warned on Sunday that Russia will face ""consequences"" if Navalny dies.

""In terms of the specific measures we would undertake, we are looking at a variety of different costs that we would impose, and I'm not going to telegraph that publicly at this point,"" Sullivan told CNN.

""But we have communicated that there will be consequences if Mr. Navalny dies.""

Sullivan said the White House had told the Kremlin that Moscow would be ""held accountable by the international community"" for what happens to Navalny while in Russian custody.

EU to discuss Navalny situation on Monday

EU foreign ministers will discuss the case of Navalny when they hold talks on Monday, Germany said.

""At tomorrow's Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels, EU foreign ministers will also address Navalny's situation,"" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told Bild newspaper on Sunday.

Earlier, his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian also said the bloc was watching Navalny's situation closely, as he warned of possible further sanctions against Russia.

""We have already taken action,"" the French minister said, referring to EU sanctions.

""The package of sanctions is already significant, but there may be others,"" warned Le Drian.

Maas also demanded that Russian authorities give Navalny swift access to proper medical care.

""We urgently demand that Alexey Navalny receive adequate medical treatment and access to doctors he trusts,"" Maas told Bild.

""His right to medical care must be granted without delay.""

Navalny, Putin's most prominent opponent, was arrested in January on returning to Russia from Berlin after recovering from a near-fatal poisoning attack he says was orchestrated by the Kremlin.

Moscow denies the allegation.

He is serving two-and-a-half years on old embezzlement charges, which he says are politically motivated, in a penal colony in the town of Pokrov around 100 kilometres (60 miles) east of Moscow.

SpaceX will need to complete a test flight ""to fully check out all systems with a landing on the lunar surface prior to our formal demonstration mission"", NASA official Lisa Watson-Morgan told reporters.

Mr Musk is one of the world's richest people thanks to his 22% stake in electric car maker Tesla, now the world's most valuable vehicle manufacturer.

His publicly stated aim is to put humans on Mars - but so far, SpaceX has mainly been used to launch satellites for his Starlink internet venture, and other satellites and space cargo.

The SpaceX programme has suffered considerable teething problems, with another failed landing for its prototype Starship spacecraft last month.

The previous three exploded at touchdown or shortly afterwards.

Those setbacks do not appear to have affected investors' confidence in his schemes, however, as SpaceX said on Wednesday it had raised about $1.16bn (£838m) in equity financing.

NASA's plan is get back to the moon and using that as a platform to send astronauts to Mars and it is looking to team up with private companies that share its vision for space exploration.

In December, NASA announced 18 astronauts who could be involved in plans to get back to the moon by 2024.

0,France top court confirms Sarah Halimi drugged murderer 'irresponsible',https://m.jpost.com/diaspora/antisemitism/frances-court-confirms-sarah-halimi-murderer-irresponsible-for-taking-drugs-665173,"The Court began its deliberations on March 4 on whether or not to overrule the lower court’s decision not to try Kobili Traoré for killing Halimi in 2017 after that decision was appealed in 2019.

France's lower court decided in December 2019 to excuse the antisemitic murderer of a Jewish woman from a criminal trial because heavy intake of cannabis supposedly compromised his “discernment,” or consciousness.

In April 2017, Traoré, a 27-year-old Muslim man, beat Halimi, his 65-year-old Jewish neighbor, while screaming ""Allah Akbar"" (God is great) and antisemitic slogans before throwing her out of the window of her third-floor apartment to her death. At the time of the ruling, the judge cited psychiatric evaluations saying Traoré’s consumption of marijuana before the incident led to a “delirious episode” that made him not legally responsible for his actions. However, the judge also said that Traoré, who is in his 30s, killed Halimi because he is an antisemite. The lower court's decision sparked outrage among the French and international Jewish community.

The Wednesday verdict triggered a fresh round of outrage from Jewish organizations, upset that such a precedent would be set.



The French Chief Rabbi reacted on Twitter, saying that such a decision was a scandal, adding that ""antisemitism was not a madness"" but a crime that should be legally punished. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); }); if(window.location.pathname.indexOf(""656089"") != -1){console.log(""hedva connatix"");document.getElementsByClassName(""divConnatix"")[0].style.display =""none"";}

April 14, 2021

The CRIF umbrella group of French Jewish communities called it a “miscarriage of justice,” while the founder of the National Bureau for Vigilance Against Antisemitism, a communal watchdog known as BNVCA, said he “no longer had full confidence that antisemitic hate crimes in France are handled properly.”

THE SIMON Wiesenthal Center also commented, saying it was profoundly distressed by the French Supreme Court's final say, concerning the legality of the Paris Appeals Court decision, denying the criminal responsibility of Halimi's murderer. ""After a harrowing three years of courtroom debate on the criminal responsibility of a murderer, presumably 'under the influence' of cannabis - which basically resulted in him being interned in a psychiatric hospital instead of being judged and condemned to prison - the family has been on edge until now,"" said Dr. Shimon Samuels, the center's director for international relations. ""This is a devastating blow!""

""Moreover, since the consumption of cannabis is intended to obtain a modification of the state of consciousness, Kobili Traoré must have been aware of the risks involved in this consumption,"" they said. ""Therefore, the consumption of narcotics is an aggravating circumstance and may not at the same time constitute grounds for exemption from criminal liability."" Samuels stressed that ""the Supreme Court’s decision now closes the case definitively... and instead of allowing it to be re-examined by the Appeals Court on the basis of a more solid legal standpoint, it confirms that it is possible to deny justice for a murder aggravated by its antisemitic character. Furthermore, this decision denies closure for the family and potentially creates a precedent for all hate criminals to simply claim insanity – or decide to smoke, snort or inject drugs or even get drunk before committing their crimes."" According to Dalloz, France’s prominent professional and university legal publisher, the main arguments of Halimi's lawyers were that ""drug addiction is not a mental illness and does not fall within the scope of psychic or neuropsychic disorders covered by article 122-1 of the penal code. The voluntary act of drug consumption constitutes wrongful behavior which excludes irresponsibility.""Moreover, since the consumption of cannabis is intended to obtain a modification of the state of consciousness, Kobili Traoré must have been aware of the risks involved in this consumption,"" they said. ""Therefore, the consumption of narcotics is an aggravating circumstance and may not at the same time constitute grounds for exemption from criminal liability.""

According to Algemeiner, following confirmation of Traoré's criminal irresponsibility, he would be held in mental health institutions until doctors deem him fit to be released back into society – and the only penalty he would receive would be a ban from visiting the site of the killing and having contact with Halimi’s family for 20 years.

“How can we have a ‘discernment’ that is abolished, but the remainder of a conscience?” Muriel Ouaknine Melki, a lawyer representing the Halimi family, told Algemeiner prior to the trial. They added that Traoré's trial was important to all French citizens, as it would set a precedent that “the consumption of narcotics can be a cause for exonerating from penal responsibility in criminal matters.”

0,Indian drugmaker says U.S. is hoarding vaccine ingredients - Marketplace,https://www.marketplace.org/2021/03/09/indian-drugmaker-says-u-s-is-hoarding-vaccine-ingredients/,"COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers around the world are meeting today to discuss a looming supply chain problem: not enough raw materials and supplies to go around.

And among the countries accused of hoarding these items? The United States.

To speed up vaccine production, the Biden administration has invoked the Defense Production Act. The law, which dates back to World War II, lets government cut to the front of the customer line for critical items made by U.S. companies.

“This essentially enables the U.S. government to tell a supplier to ship the goods, in this case, to Johnson & Johnson,” said Simon Evenett, trade economist at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland. “And those supplies, which were potentially destined to another customer, are of course then diverted.”

Unhappy customers bumped back in the queue include international vaccine makers, effectively blocking exports. The Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine producer, has contracts to produce the AstraZeneca and Novavax vaccines. CEO Adar Poonawalla said at a panel last Thursday that American raw materials are running out.

“There are a lot of bags and filters and critical items that manufacturers need,” Poonawalla said at the event, sponsored by the World Bank. “Now I’ll give you an example: the Novavax vaccine needs these items from the U.S.”

These items are being blocked from export due to Biden administration policy, he said. Marketplace asked the White House for comment, but did not hear back before deadline.

As the whole world ramps up vaccine production, key ingredients could run out.

“Unless production of what’s called the filling stage, as well as the syringes — unless this all scales up, too, there’s a potential for a problem,” Evenett said.

It’s true that the components in short supply are inexpensive, sometimes low-tech items. But until now, there’s been no business case to build more factories to crank them out.

“There’s no market and there’s no margin that will allow capacity to be built up over time,” said Krishna Udayakumar, associate director of the Duke Global Health Institute. “So we really have to invest in building that capacity.”

The looming vaccine material shortage presents the same dynamic as personal protective equipment and ventilator scarcity at the start of the pandemic: a surge in world demand, not enough to go around and countries wanting to keep supplies at home.

Still, Udayakumar defended the Biden administration’s decision to invoke the Defense Production Act for vaccines, allowing drugmaker Pfizer to potentially hit its production target of 2 billion doses by year’s end.

“That certainly is not just for the U.S.,” Udayakumar said. “That’s several times what the U.S. could use. So our ability to ramp up production will allow many other countries to also access those vaccines.”

Still, he said until vaccines are shared around the world, global trade and travel won’t be able to open up.

COVID-19 Economy FAQs Can businesses deny you entry if you don’t have a vaccine passport? As more Americans get vaccinated against COVID-19 and the economy begins reopening, some businesses are requiring proof of vaccination to enter their premises. The concept of a vaccine passport has raised ethical questions about data privacy and potential discrimination against the unvaccinated. However, legal experts say businesses have the right to deny entrance to those who can’t show proof. Give me a snapshot of the labor market in the U.S. U.S. job openings in February increased more than expected, according to the Labor Department. Also, the economy added over 900,000 jobs in March. For all of the good jobs news recently, there are still nearly 10 million people who are out of work, and more than 4 million of them have been unemployed for six months or longer. “So we still have a very long way to go until we get a full recovery,” said Elise Gould with the Economic Policy Institute. She said the industries that have the furthest to go are the ones you’d expect: “leisure and hospitality, accommodations, food services, restaurants” and the public sector, especially in education.

The central government in Libya, a former colony of Italy in northern Africa, has collapsed since the 2011 overthrow and execution of dictator Muammar Gaddafi, who had ruled the country with an iron fist since 1969. The revolution sparked intermittent fighting between clans and militias with competing claims to leadership.

“Our patient can die any minute,” Ashikhmin said on Facebook on Saturday, pointing to the opposition politician’s high potassium levels and saying Navalny should be moved to intensive care. “Fatal arrhythmia can develop any minute.”

Navalny barely survived a poisoning with the novichok nerve agent in August which he has blamed on the Kremlin. His doctors say his hunger strike may have exacerbated his condition.

Having blood potassium levels higher than 6.0 mmol (millimole) per litre usually requires immediate treatment. Navalny’s were at 7.1, the doctors said. “This means both impaired renal function and that serious heart rhythm problems can happen any minute,” said a statement on Vasilyeva’s Twitter account.

The doctors said he had to be examined immediately “taking into account the blood tests and his recent poisoning”.

Navalny’s spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh, who accompanied him when he collapsed on a plane after the poisoning in August, said the situation was critical again. “Alexei is dying,” she said on Facebook. “With his condition, it’s a matter of days.”

She said she felt like she was “on that plane again, only this time it’s landing in slow motion”, pointing out that access to Navalny was restricted and few Russians were aware of what was actually going on with him in prison.

On Saturday, responding to reporters’ questions about Navalny’s plight, Biden responded: “It’s totally, totally unfair, totally inappropriate.”

More than 70 prominent international writers, artists and academics, including Jude Law, Vanessa Redgrave and Benedict Cumberbatch, have called on Putin to ensure that Navalny receives proper treatment immediately. Their appeal was published late on Friday by France’s Le Monde newspaper.

Navalny’s team had earlier announced plans to stage what they said would be “modern Russia’s biggest protest”. Navalny’s allies said they would set a date for the protest once 500,000 supporters had registered with a website. As of 22.30pm on Saturday, more than 450,000 people had signed up.

Yarmysh on Saturday urged more Russians to sign up, saying that a big rally could help save Navalny’s life. “Putin only reacts to mass street protests,” she added.

Earlier this week, Navalny’s wife, Yulia, who visited him in the penal colony, said her husband now weighed 76kg – down 9kg since starting his hunger strike.

On Friday, Russian prosecutors asked a court to label Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation and the network of his regional offices “extremist” organisations in a move that would outlaw them in Russia and could result in jail time for their members.

“The darkest times are beginning for free-thinking people, for civil society in Russia,” said Leonid Volkov, the head of Navalny’s regional offices.",566,3643,12,72

Enlarge this image toggle caption Andre Penner/AP Andre Penner/AP

Health officials in Brazil say many hospitals are running dangerously short of sedatives and other crucial medications used for treating gravely ill COVID-19 patients.

They say some health services have already exhausted stocks of certain drugs, while others expect to do so within the next few days unless they receive fresh supplies.

The warning comes amid intense international concern over the spiraling pandemic in Brazil, where the average daily death toll has risen above 3,000, the highest in the world. To date, 365,444 people in the country have died of COVID-19, according to Brazil's health ministry.

Brazil's health crisis is being described as a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" by the international medical aid agency Doctors Without Borders (known by its French acronym, MSF), which has teams in parts of the country.

""The Brazilian authorities' ... refusal to adopt evidence-based public health measures has sent far too many to an early grave,"" MSF's international president Dr. Christos Christou said in a statement on Wednesday.

He said this has put Brazil in ""a permanent state of mourning"" and has caused ""the near collapse of Brazil's health system.""

The alarm over the lack of medicines is being raised, in particular, by the country's richest and most populous state, São Paulo, which has so far registered almost one in four of Brazil's total COVID-19 deaths.

São Paulo's state government says its health services are facing ""very serious"" shortages, notably of muscle relaxants and sedatives needed for patients on respirators in intensive care units.

In a letter sent Tuesday to Brazil's Health Ministry, the state issued an urgent appeal for fresh supplies and accused the ministry of ignoring nine recent requests.

The scale of the problem has been underscored by a survey conducted by an organization representing local health officials: This found that more than two thirds of the 3,126 municipal health services in São Paulo were completely out of muscle relaxants, while 961 had no sedatives.

Front-line medical staff are reportedly turning to less effective alternative drugs, yet there have also been Brazilian media accounts of patients being tied by their arms to their beds to prevent them reacting violently to intubation when they wake up.

One of the country's leading news organizations, Folha de S. Paulo, recently published photographs and video of patients on respirators with their arms tied to the sides of their beds in a hospital in the northwestern city of Porto Velho.

Medicine shortages are adding to the already intense pressure on the country's intensive care units, where often exhausted and depleted staff are struggling to cope with a second wave of the pandemic, propelled by new variants of the virus. In parts of the country, patients have died while waiting for ICU beds to become available, according to medical staff and victims' families.

Overall occupancy rates for ICU beds have dropped slightly recently but remain critical in most of Brazil, according to a bulletin issued Wednesday by Fiocruz, a national health research institution. It said 16 of Brazil's 26 states have ICU bed occupancy levels of 90% or above. In São Paulo, it was 86%.

Brazil's Health Ministry has reportedly had significant problems buying anything close to sufficient quantities of medicines to cope with the surge in intensive care patients. It said Thursday that a large consignment of medicines donated by businesses was to be flown into the country in the coming hours, including sedatives, muscle relaxants and other drugs.

São Paulo has long been highly critical of the response to the pandemic by President Jair Bolsonaro, who has had four health ministers since the first coronavirus case was reported in Brazil early last year.

The state is far from alone.

Bolsonaro is facing ferocious criticism at home and abroad for scoffing at the threat of the virus, undermining social distancing and isolation measures, advocating unproven remedies, bungling the national vaccination program and discouraging people from being vaccinated.

The far-right president's position has become still more uncomfortable following a decision by Brazil's Supreme Court on Wednesday to give the go-ahead to a Senate inquiry into his government's handling of the pandemic.

Bolsonaro has argued throughout that lockdowns and other pandemic restrictions inflict more economic and social misery than the virus itself. He fell back on that defense again Wednesday, with a vaguely worded warning that there will soon be ""enormous crises"" in Brazil.

""I am not threatening anyone, but Brazil is at the limit,"" he told supporters, adding mysteriously: ""I am waiting for the people to give a signal because the hunger, misery and unemployment is there.""",776,4927,11,72

Biden reiterated that sentiment Thursday afternoon in brief remarks at the White House, describing the conversation between the two as “candid and respectful.” He added that the U.S. wanted to work with Russia where it could, but would not be afraid to stand up to the country when necessary. Biden said he also invited Putin to a potential summit this summer in Europe, a possibility their teams are currently discussing.

“I was clear with President Putin that we could have gone further, but I chose not to do so. I chose to be proportionate,” he said about the new actions. “The United States is not looking to kick off a cycle of escalation and conflict with Russia. We want a stable, predictable relationship.”

The Russian Foreign Ministry suggested that Biden was not sincere about any overtures to Moscow. “The US is not ready to put up with the objective reality of a #multipolar world,” it said in a tweet.

The new sanctions are sure to be met with approval by many U.S. lawmakers from both parties, although some are likely to say they do not go far enough. For example, based on the information released by the administration, there did not appear to be any penalties aimed at stopping the Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany, a step a number of Democrats and Republicans have urged.

In a statement, the White House characterized the administration's actions as intended “to impose costs on Russia for actions by its government and intelligence services against U.S. sovereignty and interests.”

None of the new actions against Russia announced on Thursday are specifically tied to reports that Russia placed bounties on U.S. and coalition troops in Afghanistan, the senior administration official told reporters, mostly because the intelligence community still only has low-moderate confidence in that assessment. Still, the official said, the U.S. has sent private messages to Russia through diplomatic and intelligence channels urging Kremlin officials to explain the bounties allegations, which the U.S. learned about primarily through detainee reporting.

“The information puts the burden on the Russian government to explain its actions,” the official said.

The U.S. decided to respond strongly, however, to the SolarWinds hack, which targeted dozens of federal and private entities in the U.S. The Treasury Department sanctioned technology companies and malicious cyber actors that the U.S. says have supported Russian Intelligence Services, and formally attributed the SolarWinds cyber attack to the SVR, Russia’s external intelligence agency. The U.S. deemed the intrusion, which compromised thousands of U.S. government and private sector networks, a national security concern.

“This is the start of a new U.S. campaign against Russian malign behavior,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement.

With regard to Russia’s actions in Ukraine, which still claims the Crimea region as its own, OFAC “designated five individuals and three entities” for sanctions. OFAC Director Andrea Gacki said in a statement that the designations would “impose additional costs on Russia for its forceful integration with Crimea and highlight the abuses that have taken place under Russia’s attempted annexation.”

Finally, under the authority of a new executive order signed by Biden on Thursday, the Treasury Department announced a series of punitive measures including “the implementation of new prohibitions on certain dealings in Russian sovereign debt, as well as targeted sanctions on technology companies that support the Russian Intelligence Services’ efforts to carry out malicious cyber activities against the United States.”

In a letter notifying Congress of his executive order, Biden wrote that his directive would declare “a national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by specified harmful foreign activities” of the Russian government.

Biden specifically cited Russia’s efforts to “undermine the conduct of “democratic elections and institutions in the U.S. and its allies, its “malicious cyber-enabled activities,” and its use of “transnational corruption to influence foreign governments.”

Other malign behavior mentioned by Biden included the targeting of dissidents and journalists outside Russia, the undermining of security in areas where the U.S. has national security interest, and the violation of international law.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement that the administration’s actions were intended to hold the Russian government to account” for its alleged SolarWinds espionage campaign, reported bounties on U.S. troops in Afghanistan and attempted interference in the 2020 election.

Blinken announced the State Department is expelling 10 officials from the Russian diplomatic mission in Washington, including personnel who are representatives of Russian intelligence services, according to the White House. Senior administration officials would not go into detail about how they selected which Russians to eject from the U.S., other than to say that their presence did not align with their supposed status in the U.S.

“These actions are intended to hold Russia to account for its reckless actions,” Blinken said. “We will act firmly in response to Russian actions that cause harm to us or our allies and partners. Where possible, the United States will also seek opportunities for cooperation with Russia, with the goal of building a more stable and predictable relationship consistent with U.S. interests.”

0,WhatsApp Online Status Feature Could Let Anyone to Stalk You. Here’s How,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/apps/news/whatsapp-online-status-tracker-flaw-cyberstalking-individual-users-traced-2415074,"WhatsApp has been found to have a flaw that could allow third parties to stalk users, security researchers say. The issue comes through the online status feature of the instant messaging app that is available by default. A list of Android and iPhone apps as well as some Web services are available that exploit the online status feature to let third parties track individuals — without gaining their consent. Cyber-stalkers may use such tracking solutions to keep an eye on WhatsApp users.

Cybersecurity firm Traced has discovered apps and services that could be used by cyber-stalkers to track when a user becomes active on WhatsApp. “You can enter any mobile phone number, and if that person uses WhatsApp, the status tracker will provide the exact date and time that person opened WhatsApp,” the company explained in a blog post.

WhatsApp has provided the online status feature to let people know when you're online. However, unlike features such as Last Seen and Status messages, you don't have the option to disable or change your online status. This is what could be exploited by third parties.

Traced found that many WhatsApp online status trackers market themselves as a solution to help people know when their contacts come online on the app. However, they could simply be used by cyber-stalkers to constantly monitor others.

Some WhatsApp online status trackers are also found to allow users to enter the phone numbers of two individuals. This helps to presume whether both users are chatting with each other on the app at a particular time.

Google doesn't allow cyberstalking apps to be published on its Play store. However, WhatsApp online tracking apps on Google Play pretend as solutions to let parents and spouses know when their loved ones are online on WhatsApp.

This isn't the case with the Web-based online trackers as some of them are promoted clearly as the solution to track individual's WhatsApp accounts.

It is important to note that online trackers can only be used to see when someone uses WhatsApp. This means that the tracking solutions fortunately do not allow an individual to look at their messages or online activity. Third parties also need users' WhatsApp associated phone numbers to track their online status.

Having said that, the way WhatsApp has designed its online status feature appears to be the prime cause to allow this form of cyber-stalking through third-party solutions. When contacted, a WhatsApp spokesperson gave this statement to Gadgets 360:

“We provide a setting to allow people to choose who can view the time a user was ‘last seen' within WhatsApp. To help prevent abuse, we regularly work with app stores to seek the removal of apps that attempt to violate our terms of service. We have banned the WhatsApp accounts associated with such websites, requested Google remove such apps from the Play Store, and also take legal action, as appropriate. Automating WhatsApp's features to scrape information is a violation of our terms of service and we will continue to take action to protect the privacy of our users and help prevent abuse.” - WhatsApp spokesperson

Earlier this week, a WhatsApp vulnerability was discovered that allows attackers to suspend individual accounts remotely by entering their registered phone numbers. The Facebook-owned app is also of late being criticised and questioned for its privacy policy update that will allow sharing of some data with businesses.

While the age of consent was previously 15, prosecutors in France used to be required to prove sex was non-consensual to obtain a rape conviction.

For all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app.

""This is an historic law for our children and our society,"" Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti told the National Assembly.

""No adult aggressor will be able to claim the consent of a minor younger than 15-years-old.""

The vote in favouor of the bill was unanimous at its final reading, the Assembly said on Twitter.

There had been concerns from some lawmakers that an age of consent below which sex automatically constituted rape might criminalise a consensual sexual relationship between a minor and a person only a few years older.

As a consequence, a ""Romeo and Juliet"" clause that allows for sexual relations between a minor and an individual up to five years older. The clause will not apply in cases of sexual assault.

The legislation also considers incestuous sex with a minor under 18 to be rape.

In a country that has long cherished its self-image as the land of seduction and romance, sexual abuse against women and children for years went undetected or undeclared in the upper echelons of power and within celebrity circles.

But there has been much soul-searching in recent years.

The #MeToo movement that swept around the world after numerous women in 2017 accused U.S. movie producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault proved a turning point in France. So too did the fall from grace in 2020 of a French writer who had written openly about his pedophilia.

France had already toughened its sex crimes laws in 2018 when it outlawed sexual harassment on the streets, leaving cat-callers and aggressively lecherous individuals facing potential on-the-spot fines.

The tip line allows people to report fellow netizens who ""distort"" the Party's history, attack its leadership and policies, defame national heroes and ""deny the excellence of advanced socialist culture"" online, said a notice posted by an arm of the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) on Friday.

""Some with ulterior motives ... have been spreading historical nihilistic misrepresentations online, maliciously distorting, denigrating and negating the history of the Party,"" said the notice.

""We hope that the majority of Internet users will actively play their part in supervising society ... and enthusiastically report harmful information,"" it said.

""Historical nihilism"" is a phrase used in China to describe public doubt and scepticism over the Chinese Communist Party's description of past events.

China's internet is tightly censored and most foreign social media networks, search engines and news outlets are banned in the country.

Internet authorities often increase censorship and online supervision ahead of major events including historical anniversaries, political meetings and sports events.

The notice did not specify what punishments would be dealt to people who are reported through the hotline, but netizens in China already face jail time and other legal punishments for posting content that is critical of the county's leadership, policies and history.

Legal amendments released earlier this year stipulate that people who ""insult, slander of infringe upon"" the memory of China's national heroes and martyrs face jail time of up to three years.

Last week, authorities in the eastern Chinese province of Jiangsu detained a 19-year-old man after making ""insulting"" comments online about Japan's 1937 occupation of Nanjing.

Chinese social media sites that fail to censor critical content also face financial sanctions as well as temporary suspensions of service under current law.

0,Health official alleges ‘sexual slavery’ in Tigray; women blame soldiers,https://www.reuters.com/world/special-report-health-official-alleges-sexual-slavery-tigray-women-blame-2021-04-15/,"An Ethiopian woman who says she was gang-raped by armed men is seen during an interview with Reuters in a hospital in the town of Adigrat, Tigray region, Ethiopia, March 18, 2021. REUTERS/Baz Ratner

The young mother was trying to get home with food for her two children when she says soldiers pulled her off a minibus in Ethiopia’s Tigray region, claiming it was overloaded.

It was the beginning of an 11-day ordeal in February, during which she says she was repeatedly raped by 23 soldiers who forced nails, a rock and other items into her vagina, and threatened her with a knife.

Doctors showed Reuters the bloodstained stone and two 3-inch nails they said they had removed from her body.

The woman, 27, is among hundreds who have reported that they were subjected to horrific sexual violence by Ethiopian and allied Eritrean soldiers after fighting broke out in November in the mountainous northern region of Ethiopia, doctors said.

Some women were held captive for extended periods, days or weeks at a time, said Dr Fasika Amdeselassie, the top public health official for the government-appointed interim administration in Tigray.

“Women are being kept in sexual slavery,” Fasika told Reuters. “The perpetrators have to be investigated.”

Reports of rape have been circulating for months. But Fasika’s assertion, based on women’s accounts, marks the first time an Ethiopian official - in this case, a top regional health officer - has made a sexual slavery accusation in connection with the conflict in Tigray.

loading

In addition, eight other doctors at five public hospitals told Reuters that most of the rape victims described their attackers as either Ethiopian government soldiers or Eritrean troops. It was more common for women to report sexual violence by Eritrean soldiers, the doctors said.

The Eritreans have been helping Ethiopia’s central government fight the region’s former ruling party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), in the conflict plaguing the Horn of Africa nation.

Taken together, the descriptions paint the most detailed picture to date of the sexual violence against women in Tigray and the military’s alleged involvement in it.

Most people interviewed for this article declined to be identified. They said they feared reprisals, including possible violence, by soldiers who guard the hospitals and towns.

Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed acknowledged in a speech to parliament on March 23 that “atrocities were being committed by raping women” and promised that the perpetrators would be punished. He did not identify the alleged perpetrators.

He said then for the first time that Eritrean soldiers had entered the conflict in Tigray in support of the Ethiopian government after the TPLF attacked military bases across the region in the early hours of Nov. 4. Ethiopia’s government had previously denied this, and the Eritrean government still does not acknowledge their troops' presence. The TPLF was the dominant power in the central government when Eritrea fought a bloody border war with Ethiopia a generation ago.

Neither the Ethiopian nor the Eritrean governments responded to Reuters’ questions about specific cases raised by women and their doctors, or about the accusation of sexual slavery. No charges have been announced by civilian or military prosecutors against any soldiers. However, officials in both countries emphasized that their governments have zero tolerance for sexual violence - a point Abiy’s spokeswoman, Billene Seyoum, said the prime minister reiterated recently in discussions with military leaders.

The alleged sexual violence has drawn international attention.

Billene said the United Nations, the African Union and Ethiopia’s state-appointed human rights commission have been authorized to carry out joint investigations into alleged abuses by all sides in the conflict. That includes the “criminal clique,” she said, referring to the TPLF.

An Ethiopian military spokesman and the head of a government task force on the Tigray crisis did not respond to phone calls and text messages seeking comment. Reuters could not reach military leaders in either country.

Asked about the reports that Eritrean troops have committed rapes in Tigray and are keeping women in sexual slavery, the country’s information minister, Yemane Gebremeskel, accused TPLF activists of “coaching ‘sympathizers’ to create false testimonies.”

“All the fabricated stories - which are alien to our culture and laws - are peddled to cover up the crimes of the TPLF which started the war,” he told Reuters in a written response.

Reuters was unable to reach a TPLF spokesman.

RECORDS OF ABUSE

Fasika, the health official, said at least 829 cases of sexual assault have been reported at the five hospitals since the conflict in Tigray began.

Those cases were likely “the tip of the iceberg,” Fasika said. Rape is underreported in Ethiopia because it carries a huge stigma. Also, most of the region’s health facilities are no longer functioning, and travel between towns remains dangerous, he said.

Most of the women who have come forward are either pregnant or sustained severe physical injury from the rapes, Fasika said.

Reuters interviewed 11 women who said they had been raped by soldiers from Eritrea, Ethiopia or both. Four said they were kidnapped, taken to military camps and gang raped, in some cases alongside other women. The women did not know the camp names but said they were located near Mekelle and the towns of Idaga Hamus, Wukro and Sheraro.

Five other women said they were held in fields or deserted houses for up to six days. And two said they were raped in their own homes.

Reuters could not independently verify their accounts. However, all told similar stories of being beaten and brutalized. Healthcare providers confirmed that the 11 women’s injuries were consistent with the events they described, and they showed Reuters medical records for three of the women detailing their conditions.

The healthcare providers also shared details of nine other cases of sexual assault, including the ordeals of two 14-year-old girls.

Although Ethiopia’s government declared victory over the TPLF in November, fighting continues in some areas, and medical workers say new rapes are reported at the region’s health facilities every day.

“This is being done to dishonour the women, to break their pride,” said a doctor at Ayder Referral Hospital, in Mekelle, citing the brutality of the attacks and humiliation of victims. ""This is not for sexual gratification. The rapes are to punish Tigray.""

‘TELL MY STORY’

The 27-year-old mother said uniformed soldiers from Eritrea pulled her off a minibus on the road from Mekelle to the city of Adigrat on Feb. 6. They tied her up and marched her through fields to a bush camp, she said. After 11 days of rapes and beatings, she said, the soldiers forced nails, cotton, plastic bags and a rock into her vagina and left her alone in the bush.

Villagers found her unconscious and brought her to a nearby hospital.

She said she was still bleeding from severe internal injuries and could not control her urine, walk without a crutch or sit up for long periods. One leg was broken, she said.

She also described a different kind of pain: While in the hospital, she has no way to speak to her 4-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter because the Eritrean soldiers took her cell phone. She had left the children with her mother to search for food and never returned. At the time, the family had less than a week’s worth of bread.

""I don’t know anything, if they are dead or alive,"" she said. ""The enemy destroyed my life.""

A 32-year-old mother in Mekelle told Reuters that soldiers removed her from a minibus on the same road at the end of February. They were dressed in Ethiopian uniforms, she said, but spoke with an Eritrean accent and had traditional facial scarification typical of the neighbouring country. She said they shot her 12-year-old son dead in front of her, then brought her to a camp where she was held with other female captives and repeatedly raped for 10 days.

""Tell my story,"" she said. ""This is happening to women out there right now. I want this to end with me.""

A 28-year-old house cleaner said soldiers grabbed her from a street in Mekelle on the afternoon of Feb. 10 and took her to a field outside a military base where she was raped by more than 10 men wearing Ethiopian or Eritrean uniforms.

Wiping away tears, she said that during her two-week ordeal, soldiers doused her with alcohol and mocked her as they assaulted her. She escaped when her captors were distracted by gunfire, she said.

SHOT FOR RESISTING

The government has set up a task force separate from the human rights commission to investigate the reports of sexual violence. Its head, Mebrihit Assefa, said the body includes representatives from the regional health bureau, the attorney general’s office and federal police.

The task force plans to set up five centers where rape survivors can file reports with law enforcement and receive medical and psychosocial support.

“Our prosecutors (and) police officers are there to investigate all crimes committed, including sexual violence,” said Awol Sultan, a spokesman for the attorney general’s office.

He did not respond to questions about the women alleging they were raped during captivity, or whether prosecutors were in touch with either the Eritrean or Ethiopian militaries. The results of the criminal investigations will be released publicly at an unspecified date, he said.

Abera Nigus, the head of Tigray’s justice bureau, said the legal process was likely to be complicated because most courts are not functioning in Tigray, and many rape victims cannot identify their assailants.

Knowing their rapists are still at large also has discouraged women from seeking help, doctors said.

Many of the women who sought treatment at hospitals had vaginal and anal tears, sexually transmitted diseases and injuries that rendered them incontinent, said the Ayder hospital doctor, an obstetrician gynecologist. The doctor shared notes from 11 cases the hospital had treated involving women raped by soldiers.

One woman had been gang raped on three separate occasions, according to the hospital notes.

Another was five months pregnant when she was raped, the notes indicate. Two 14-year-old girls were sexually assaulted in front of their families. One girl had a hand and foot amputated.

She had been shot for resisting her assailant.

Milton DK It is time to address airborne transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). If an infectious virus spreads predominantly through large respiratory droplets that fall quickly, the key control measures are reducing direct contact, cleaning surfaces, physical barriers, physical distancing, use of masks within droplet distance, respiratory hygiene, and wearing high-grade protection only for so-called aerosol-generating health-care procedures. Such policies need not distinguish between indoors and outdoors, since a gravity-driven mechanism for transmission would be similar for both settings. But if an infectious virus is mainly airborne, an individual could potentially be infected when they inhale aerosols produced when an infected person exhales, speaks, shouts, sings, sneezes, or coughs. Reducing airborne transmission of virus requires measures to avoid inhalation of infectious aerosols, including ventilation, air filtration, reducing crowding and time spent indoors, use of masks whenever indoors, attention to mask quality and fit, and higher-grade protection for health-care staff and front-line workers.Airborne transmission of respiratory viruses is difficult to demonstrate directly.Mixed findings from studies that seek to detect viable pathogen in air are therefore insufficient grounds for concluding that a pathogen is not airborne if the totality of scientific evidence indicates otherwise. Decades of painstaking research, which did not include capturing live pathogens in the air, showed that diseases once considered to be spread by droplets are airborne.Ten streams of evidence collectively support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted primarily by the airborne route.

First, superspreading events account for substantial SARS-CoV-2 transmission; indeed, such events may be the pandemic's primary drivers.Detailed analyses of human behaviours and interactions, room sizes, ventilation, and other variables in choir concerts, cruise ships, slaughterhouses, care homes, and correctional facilities, among other settings, have shown patterns—eg, long-range transmission and overdispersion of the basic reproduction number (R), discussed below—consistent with airborne spread of SARS-CoV-2 that cannot be adequately explained by droplets or fomites.The high incidence of such events strongly suggests the dominance of aerosol transmission.

Direct measurements show that speaking produces thousands of aerosol particles and few large droplets,which supports the airborne route.

Sampling of airborne virus is technically challenging for several reasons, including limited effectiveness of some sampling methods for collecting fine particles, viral dehydration during collection, viral damage due to impact forces (leading to loss of viability), reaerosolisation of virus during collection, and viral retention in the sampling equipment.Measles and tuberculosis, two primarily airborne diseases, have never been cultivated from room air.

Tenth, there is limited evidence to support other dominant routes of transmission—ie, respiratory droplet or fomite.Ease of infection between people in close proximity to each other has been cited as proof of respiratory droplet transmission of SARS-CoV-2. However, close-proximity transmission in most cases along with distant infection for a few when sharing air is more likely to be explained by dilution of exhaled aerosols with distance from an infected person.The flawed assumption that transmission through close proximity implies large respiratory droplets or fomites was historically used for decades to deny the airborne transmission of tuberculosis and measles.This became medical dogma, ignoring direct measurements of aerosols and droplets which reveal flaws such as the overwhelming number of aerosols produced in respiratory activities and the arbitrary boundary in particle size of 5 μm between aerosols and droplets, instead of the correct boundary of 100 μm.It is sometimes argued that since respiratory droplets are larger than aerosols, they must contain more viruses. However, in diseases where pathogen concentrations have been quantified by particle size, smaller aerosols showed higher pathogen concentrations than droplets when both were measured.

In conclusion, we propose that it is a scientific error to use lack of direct evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in some air samples to cast doubt on airborne transmission while overlooking the quality and strength of the overall evidence base. There is consistent, strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 spreads by airborne transmission. Although other routes can contribute, we believe that the airborne route is likely to be dominant. The public health community should act accordingly and without further delay.

New Delhi (AFP)

A Hindu seer has died from coronavirus and 80 other holy men have tested positive after attending a vast Indian religious festival where millions of pilgrims have been ignoring Covid-19 advice despite a national surge in infections.

The announcement from authorities in Haridwar, Uttarakhand state, came as India recorded more than 217,000 fresh cases in the past 24 hours, taking the total number of new infections to more than two million since April 1.

The festival of Kumbh Mela has long rung alarm bells among health experts who say it could turn into a ""super-spreader"" as pilgrims return home to their towns and villages all across India.

A gathering on the banks of the holy River Ganges in Haridwar happens every 12 years, and has attracted as many as 25 million people to the site since January, including some 4.6 million on two auspicious days this week alone.

The enormous crowds of pilgrims -- including cannabis-smoking holy men with dreadlocks -- taking a dip in the river have mostly ignored official advice to maintain distancing.

Earlier this week, Mahamandaleshwar Kapil Dev Das, 65, head of one of the Hindu akhadas or ascetic councils, was admitted to hospital and died from coronavirus on Thursday, officials said.

""We had around 2,000 positive cases since Monday during random testing of pilgrims at the Kumbh,"" Harbeer Singh, a top festival officer, told AFP.

""We are taking precautions and urging people to adhere to coronavirus prevention behaviours.""

The officer said they had ramped up testing at the event's 600-hectare (1,500-acre) site and insisted they were strictly enforcing government protocols, including requiring negative virus certificates.

Two of the 13 Hindu ascetic councils that are part of the major get-together have now pulled out over soaring Covid cases in the city.

Singh said more than 25,000 pilgrims were still visiting every day and they were expecting 2-3 million devotees on the last grand bathing event on April 27 before the festival concludes.

The Uttarakhand state government has exempted the event from restrictions limiting gatherings to 200 people.

State Chief Minister Tirath Singh Rawat said in early April that no devotees would be ""unnecessarily harassed in the name of Covid-19 restrictions"".

He too later tested positive for the virus, which has so far killed almost 175,000 Indians and infected 14.3 million, the second most in the world after the United States.

Meanwhile, the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, home to some 240 million people, on Friday became the latest to announce restrictions on gatherings, calling a day-long lockdown on Sunday with fines of 1,000 rupees (US $14) for failing to wear a mask.

France has advised French citizens to temporarily leave Pakistan and warned of serious threats to French interests in the country, two diplomatic sources said on Thursday, after violent clashes there this week.

Thousands of Pakistani Islamists had clashed with police earlier this week in protest against the arrest of their leader ahead of rallies denouncing French cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammad.

For Muslims, depictions of the Prophet are blasphemous.

The diplomatic sources said that a message had been sent overnight to French citizens and companies following threats by hardline Islamist group Tehrik-i-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) to target French interests.

The sources said the embassy sent a message to French residents in Pakistan recommending that French nationals leave the country and French companies shut down activities temporarily ""due to the serious threats to French interests in Pakistan"".

Relations between Paris and Islamabad have worsened since the end of last year after President Emmanuel Macron paid tribute to a French history teacher who was beheaded by an 18-year-old man of Chechen origin for showing cartoons of the Prophet in a class on freedom of speech.

The images sparked anger and protests in the Muslim world, especially in Pakistan, and even saw a Pakistani minister forced to withdraw comments she made that Macron was treating Muslims like Nazis had treated Jews in World War Two.

Last year, TLP ended a similar protest against France only after the government signed a deal agreeing to endorse a boycott of French products and making a move in parliament to expel French ambassador. It had this week demanded the envoy be expelled.

Pakistan has said it would outlaw the group and the arrest of its leader this week sparked further protests against France.

""It's a serious situation and we know that in Pakistan things can escalate quickly,"" said one of the diplomatic sources.

Pakistan’s embassy in Paris did not immediately respond for comment.

Coroners released the names of the victims late Friday. Four of them were members of Indianapolis' Sikh community — another blow to the Asian American community that comes a month after six people of Asian descent were killed in a mass shooting in the Atlanta area and amid ongoing attacks against Asian Americans amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Marion County Coroner's office identified the dead as:

Matthew R Alexander, 32.

The shooter was identified as Brandon Scott Hole of Indianapolis, Deputy Police Chief Craig McCartt told a news conference. Investigators searched a home in Indianapolis associated with Hole and seized evidence, including desktop computers and other electronic media, McCartt said. The home is located in a neighbourhood of midcentury houses near Interstate 465.

Hole began firing randomly at people in the parking lot of the FedEx facility late Thursday, killing four, before entering the building, fatally shooting four more people and then turning the gun on himself, McCartt said. He said the shooter apparently killed himself shortly before police entered the building. He said he did not know if Hole owned the gun legally.

""There was no confrontation with anyone that was there,"" he said. ""There was no disturbance, there was no argument. He just appeared to randomly start shooting.""

McCartt said the slayings took place in a matter of minutes, and that there were at least 100 people in the facility at the time. Many were changing shifts or were on their dinner break, he said. Several people were wounded, including five who were taken to the hospital.

Paul Keenan, special agent in charge of the FBI's Indianapolis field office, said Friday that agents questioned Hole last year after his mother called police to say that her son might commit ""suicide by cop."" He said the FBI was called after items were found in Hole's bedroom but he did not elaborate on what they were.

He said agents found no evidence of a crime and that they did not identify Hole as espousing a racially motivated ideology. A police report obtained by The Associated Press shows that officers seized a pump-action shotgun from Hole's home after responding to the mother's call. Keenan said the gun was never returned.

McCartt said Hole was a former employee of FedEx and last worked for the company in 2020. The deputy police chief said he did not know why Hole left the job or if he had ties to the workers in the facility. He said police have not yet uncovered a motive for the shooting.

Police Chief Randal Taylor noted that a ""significant"" number of employees at the FedEx facility are members of the Sikh community, and the Sikh Coalition later issued a statement saying it was ""sad to confirm"" that at least four of those killed were community members.

The coalition, which identifies itself as the largest Sikh civil rights organization in the U.S., said in the statement that it expected authorities to ""conduct a full investigation — including the possibility of bias as a factor.""

Varun Nikore, executive director of the AAPI Victory Alliance, a national advocacy group for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, said in a statement that the shootings marked ""yet another senseless massacre that has become a daily occurrence in this country.""

Nikore added, ""The senseless gun violence that we're seeing in this country is reflective of all of the spineless politicians who are beholden to the gun lobby. Period. End of story. They will be hearing from us — instead of offering thoughts and prayers, it's time to mobilize for direct action and vote them out. That is what we're doing today. We will end the violence, only when we have leaders who have the guts to do so.""

Calls for gun control

The killings marked the latest in a string of recent mass shootings across the country and the third mass shooting this year in Indianapolis. Five people, including a pregnant woman, were shot and killed in the city in January, and a man was accused of killing three adults and a child before abducting his daughter during at argument at a home in March. In other states last month, eight people were fatally shot at massage businesses in the Atlanta area, and 10 died in gunfire at a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado.

Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett said the community must guard against resignation and ""the assumption that this is simply how it must be and we might as well get used to it.""

President Joe Biden said he had been briefed on the shooting and called gun violence ""an epidemic"" in the U.S.

But he wanted to gather what samples he could, so he ascended a short distance to find some cleaner snow off to the side of the trail. “I just pulled out the bottles and took samples,” he said.

And then another surprise: There, at the roof of the world, the snow samples showed traces of toxic chemicals known as PFAS, laboratory analyses done later showed. More notable results came from samples his colleagues gathered at lower elevation, which revealed these substances at levels far higher than at other mountains around the world.

“We were shocked,” said Kimberley Miner, an assistant research professor at the University of Maine Climate Change Institute, who coordinated the research remotely from the United States. “We retested everything like three times, because it was much higher than we expected.”

The study by Miner and colleagues, published in December, was part of the 2019 National Geographic and Rolex Perpetual Planet Everest Expedition, a large, interdisciplinary research project intended to understand the climate change threats facing mountain systems. It shows chemical fingerprints smudging even the world’s tallest peak in ways unseen and previously unstudied.

“The purpose of the expedition was to see if the highest parts of the planet are affected by human activity,” said Paul Mayewski, the expedition leader and director of the university’s Climate Change Institute.

Miner’s research has taken her all over the world to study chemicals in glaciers, especially persistent organic pollutants such as PFAS — shorthand for per- and polyfluorinated substances. Sometimes called “forever chemicals,” these are toxic compounds that break down slowly and accumulate over time in people and other animals.

Such pollutants are found in low concentrations in the atmosphere, and they are blown all over the globe. Then, when it rains or snows, they often are deposited on the ground. So Miner suspected the Everest samples would only show low levels of persistent chemicals from this sort of atmospheric deposition.

But when the Everest samples were shipped to an analytical lab, she learned about the PFAS levels that were particularly high in the samples from lower down on the mountain.

“I thought we’d screwed up, and we hadn’t,” Miner said. “We got consistently these very, very high levels.”

Miner’s samples showed two specific PFAS chemicals were especially high — perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). The chemicals have been used since the 1950s to repel stains and water in carpeting, upholstery and apparel; in nonstick cookware and food packaging; and in floor wax, textiles, fire fighting foam and sealants. Neither is still manufactured in the United States, but they are made in other countries.

Both have been linked to health problems. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, “both chemicals are very persistent in the environment and in the human body — meaning they don’t break down and they can accumulate over time. There is evidence that exposure to PFAS can lead to adverse human health effects.”

These effects may include increased cholesterol, changes in liver enzymes and increased risk of kidney or testicular cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“What we found was that the PFOS was at such higher levels than had been reported anywhere else in high mountain ranges,” Miner said. “And then the rest of the story was how the heck did these get there, and why were they so high?”

Fortunately, Cyclone Fani dropped 10 inches of fresh snow while the expedition was still at the Everest Base Camp, where a colleague of Miner’s at the Climate Change Institute, Heather Clifford, was gathering samples for the team. (The Base Camp is at an elevation of about 17,400 feet and more than 1,000 people were there at the time.)

Story continues below advertisement

Clifford took samples of the fresh snow, and one of the samples showed no PFAS; the other a trace. Taken together, the findings suggest that the high levels of PFAS were not from atmospheric deposition. Instead, it appeared that they had been shed from climbers’ outdoor gear such as parkas and tents, which are often treated with chemicals to weatherproof.

Other samples, gathered for a different research group, found microplastics — shreds of polyester — that probably came from outdoor gear. The plastic levels were highest in the areas most used by climbing teams, as with PFAS.

“You’re seeing the highest concentrations where you have the most people and the most garbage,” Miner said. “It’s kind of like sampling a frozen landfill.”

Story continues below advertisement

Fabric companies have long used PFAS to repel water in outerwear, although some companies have now moved away from the chemicals for environmental reasons. W.L. Gore & Associates, the maker of Gore-Tex, for instance, said the company does use some chemicals in the PFAS family, but has transitioned to those believed to be less harmful, Gore spokesperson Amy Calhoun said. Of the four compounds Miner detected on Everest, Calhoun said, three “have either been eliminated from or never used in Gore’s consumer fabrics supply chain.” But traces of the fourth one may still be detected in some of its products.

Rainer Lohmann leads a University of Rhode Island research center focused on PFAS. He said he accepts that the chemicals Miner found probably came from outdoor gear, but said he would like to see more sampling on Everest to fill out the picture.

Lohmann said the levels of PFAS in Everest meltwater, although higher than expected from an alpine glacier, would still be within safe drinking water limits in the United States.

Story continues below advertisement

Still, Miner said she is concerned about possible health risks as more chemicals melt out of glaciers.

“The more chemicals and the more plastics we put into the environment, the more they are going to build up and they are going to stay, and they are not going to go away,” Miner said. “And it is going to impact us more and more, in lots of different interlocking ways.”

Lohmann said it is especially striking to see this pollution on Everest.

Two Russian warships transited the Bosphorus en route to the Black Sea on Saturday and 15 smaller vessels completed a transfer to the sea as Moscow beefs up its naval presence at a time of tense relations with the West and Ukraine.

The reinforcement coincides with a huge build-up of Russian troops near Ukraine, something Moscow calls a temporary defensive exercise, and follows an escalation in fighting in eastern Ukraine between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian government forces.

Russia's relations with Washington, which cancelled the deployment of two of its own warships to the Black Sea last week after fierce Russian protests, are at a post-Cold war low.

Moscow expelled 10 U.S. diplomats on Friday in retaliation for the expulsion of the same number of Russian diplomats from the United States over alleged malign activity.

Russia has also temporarily restricted the movement of foreign warships “and other state ships” near Crimea, which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014, a move condemned by both Kyiv and Washington.

Two Russian Ropucha-class landing ships from Russia's Northern Fleet, capable of carrying tanks and of delivering armour and troops during coastal assaults, transited the Bosphorus on Saturday, a Reuters reporter in Istanbul saw.

More Russian naval reinforcements in the form of two more landing ships, this time from Russia's Baltic Fleet, are expected to imminently transit the Bosphorus.

The RIA news agency on Saturday also reported that 15 smaller vessels from Russia's Caspian Flotilla have completed their transfer to the Black Sea as part of an exercise.

In a further sign of heightened tensions in the region, a ship carrying logistics trucks and equipment for NATO forces in Romania transited the Bosphorus on Friday evening, the same Reuters reporter saw.

In St Petersburg, Russia's FSB security service briefly detained a Ukrainian diplomat, Ukraine's foreign ministry said on Saturday. L1N2MA04O

The Interfax news agency earlier cited the FSB as saying Oleksandr Sosoniuk was taken into custody when he tried to obtain classified information from Russian law enforcement databases during a meeting with a Russian citizen.

0,‘They Are Going to Torture Us’: Denmark Tells Syrian Refugees to Go Home,https://www.vice.com/en/article/93y9mp/denmark-syria-refugees,"Under a law passed by the left-leaning government in power in 2015, at the height of the Syrian refugee crisis, some Syrian nationals were granted asylum due to the general levels of violence in their home country. The law also gives the government powers to re-evaluate and revoke residence permits for those people if the conditions in the place they fled from are “significantly improved.”

This is all because Denmark, alone out of any Western government and against the advice of all notable organisations and authorities in the field, has determined that the Syrian capital Damascus is safe enough for refugees to return, and has begun the process of revoking residence permits.

Issa’s family escaped the civil war in Syria , and for several years they have lived in northern Denmark. But now Issa, her younger sister, and their mother, along with 500 other Syrian nationals , face having their right to live in the country rescinded.

“We have nothing in Syria, not even a house. What are we going to do, live on the street?”

The Syrian civil war began in March 2011, and over the past decade more than 400,000 people have died, 6 million people have been displaced, and entire cities have been razed. More than 13 million of the country’s current population of 17 million depend on humanitarian aid to survive. By the bloody standards of the conflict, the fighting has mostly stopped, and while the government is not in complete control of the country, the regime has effectively won.

The situation facing Issa is Kafkaesque. Denmark does not officially recognise the regime of Bashar al-Assad , and therefore is not currently considering forced deportations. Instead, Issa and her family must choose to either return voluntarily – something she says is out of the question – or move into a deportation centre designed to make going back to war-torn Syria seem more enticing.

Last year, a report by the Danish Office of Immigration concluded that the situation in and around Damascus had improved to such an extent that refugees from the area no longer qualified for protection under that law. And as such, the centre-left but anti-immigration Social Democrat government in Denmark has started to inform people like Issa and her family that they are no longer welcome.

Denmark’s assessment that Damascus is safe for refugees to return to is based on the fact that the regime forces have control of the capital and its surroundings. But for those who fled the brutality of Assad and his troops, the idea of returning to an area controlled by the very same military is absurd. Peace is not the same as security, critics say.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN watchdog that works to protect the rights of refugees, said earlier this year that Damascus was not safe for Syrian refugees to return to. It also said that forcing people to return could constitute a breach of the UN Refugee Convention , which Denmark was the first country to sign in 1952. In a statement to VICE World News, the UNHCR Representation for the Nordic and Baltic countries, said: “UNHCR is concerned about this development as UNHCR does not consider the recent improvements in security in parts of Syria to be sufficiently fundamental, stable or durable to justify ending international protection for any group of refugees. UNHCR continues to call for protection to be maintained for Syrian refugees and urge that they should not be returned forcibly to any part of Syria, regardless of who is in control of the area concerned.”

“The very reason the general level of violence in greater Damascus has fallen is that it has come under the full control of one of the most [violent] and notoriously repressive regimes,” he said. “It makes no sense that the authorities would send back Syrian refugees to an area controlled by a government they don’t recognise and refuse to cooperate with due to their human rights abuses,” said Zahle.

“There is no one else in the world who thinks Damascus is safe,” said Villads Zahle, a communications officer at the European Council for Refugees and Exiles, an umbrella organisation which monitors refugee rights in Europe. Zahle said he was bewildered that Denmark would consider returning refugees to a country controlled by a regime that Denmark itself refuses to recognise.

The prospect of returning to Syria clearly terrifies Issa. Her family fled from Damascus in 2015 because her father and brother were being pursued by the regime. Issa’s father died shortly after the family arrived in Denmark, and along with her mother and younger sister, she also has an older sister, as well as her brother. By a cruel bureaucratic twist, her brother and older sister are not facing deportation, as they technically arrived in Denmark as political refugees, a classification that was not extended to the rest of the family. “I know that if they send us back, I’ll never see them again,” Issa said. “They mean everything to my mom and I.”

“There’s a risk that you can disappear with no one knowing where you are, or you can be put in prison. And we know that, in the regime’s prisons, they use abuse and torture, and some even die. This is partly because of the horrible conditions in the prisons, but sometimes because they are executed,” she told VICE World News. “So these are some of the worst types of human rights violations that we’re seeing.”

“We absolutely do not believe that the situation has changed enough to start suspending residence permits or refuse to offer them protection based on the general level of violence in Syria and Damascus,” said Lisa Blinkenberg, senior policy adviser at Amnesty International.

In January this year, Amnesty International sent an open letter to Denmark’s Minister of Immigration and Integration, Mattias Tesfaye, warning him against going through with the decision due to the Syrian regime’s well-documented record of human rights abuses against political dissidents.

Many other families face being separated in this way, and due to the way refugees were classified when they first arrived in Denmark, it is mainly Syrian children, women, and the elderly having their residence permits torn up. This is because younger men are legally considered victims of individual persecution by the regime, often due to them being military deserters.

It is well known in Syria that if you are arrested by regime forces, you are likely to disappear never to be seen again. It is estimated that almost 100,000 people have been victims of “enforced disappearances” by the regime since 2011. And in 2019, the Washington Post reported that despite Assad urging refugees to return home, those who did were welcomed by the regime with arrests and interrogations, and in some cases with torture.

She continued: “If my mom is sent back, she’ll have to account for her son and husband’s escape from the regime. My mom risks going to prison and being tortured, because they want to punish her for her family fleeing.”

“Everyone who’s lived in Syria knows this,” said Issa. “If one family member is in their sights, the entire family is responsible for that person. If we go back, they will do so many horrible things to us. They are going take us, and they are going to torture us. I’m really scared.”

If they were to return to Syria, Issa says her family would likely be persecuted by the regime for having fled alongside her brother and father, who were being pursued, and by the simple fact that the entire family is Kurdish, a group that has historically been discriminated against by the Syrian authorities and has been a key opposition force during the war.

On top of all this, Issa’s mother is unwell, suffering from diabetes, herniated discs in both neck and back, high cholesterol, and mental health challenges too, meaning Issa would have to provide for her mother and younger sister, just 13, in Syria.

The family are currently waiting for their appeals to be heard in the only court that can overturn the decision to remove their residence permits, with a ruling expected in either May or June. Until then their lives are on hold.

Most if not all of the refugees who have now had their residence permits revoked are expected to refuse to voluntarily return to Syria, meaning that they will instead be lodged at one of three deportation centres in Denmark. There is limited opportunity for personal development at the centres, with no access to education or work, and the conditions of life there are often described as prison-like. Families face a purgatory-like existence, with no set end date, until the government negotiates an agreement with the Assad regime to begin forced deportations, or until they’re so tired of their situation that they’d rather return to Syria.",1513,8978,13,72
0,TuSimple becomes first stand-alone autonomous truck company to go public,https://www.primemovermag.com.au/tusimple-becomes-first-stand-alone-autonomous-truck-company-to-go-public/,"Self-driving truck startup, TuSimple, has raised $USD1.35 billion in a public offering overnight.

The news comes after the San Diego-based company announced earlier in the week that it had launched a roadshow for its initial public offering.

Alongside an existing investor, TuSimple sold an estimated 33.8 million shares at $40 per share in a move viewed as a significant step in helping the company commercialise self-driving trucks and expand its autonomous freight network across the United States.

The company, which has operations in Tucson, Arizona and Shanghai and Beijing in China, wants to achieve SAE Level 4 automated driving across its operations, which would see the vehicle operate autonomously without human input or intervention given the right conditions.

An explosion in eCommerce combined and with a worldwide heavy vehicle operator shortage is fuelling investments in the embryonic driverless delivery segment.

Just this week IVECO signed a memorandum of understanding with autonomous trucking company Plus to jointly develop autonomous trucks.

Last week Volvo Group announced a long-term partnership with self-driving technology company Aurora.

Despite a loss of more than $USD300 million since 2018, TuSimple insists it will see a turnaround in fortunes once production on its self-driving trucks commences in 2024.

According to its IPO filing the company has customer reservations of over 5,700 trucks with the likes of Navistar International and Traton SE among them.

The IPO makes TuSimple the first go-it-alone autonomous truck developer to be publicly traded.

Later this year TuSimple has plans to run a truck without a human safety driver for more than 100 miles day and night as part of its proof of concept for its self-driving technology.

The Traton Group, the parent company of Scania and MAN trucks, acquired the remainder of Navistar International in November, 2020.

TuSimple have already entered into a global partnership to develop self-driving trucks with Traton.

The two companies have agreed to launch a development program to operate the first SAE level 4 autonomous hub-to-hub route between Södertälje to Jönköping in Sweden using Scania commercial vehicles.

“Our partnership with Traton Group accelerates the introduction of autonomous truck technology to new international markets, and we look forward to our global partnership,” said Cheng Lu, TuSimple President.

“The Traton Group has an excellent reputation and established a portfolio of world-class truck brands, their strategic investment in TuSimple is a powerful testimony to our technology and approach.”",395,2621,10,72

The Czech Republic is expelling 18 employees of the Russian embassy, who are Russian intelligence officers in the Czech special services’ version, First Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Jan Hamacek, who is also Acting Foreign Minister, said at news conference on Saturday.

""As the Czech foreign minister, I decided to expel all the employees of the Russian embassy in Prague who have been clearly identified by our special services as officers of the Russian intelligence agencies SVR and GRU. Within 48 hours, 18 staff members of the Russian embassy must leave the Czech Republic,"" he said.

The deputy prime minister said with regret that the step would deliver a hard blow to Russian-Czech relations, but the republic, in his version, was forced to do it.

""We are in the same situation as the UK was after the poisoning attempt [of the Skripals] in Salisbury in 2018. By 19.00 (20.00 Moscow time - TASS), I summoned the Russian ambassador [to the Czech Republic Alexander] Zmeyevsky and informed him about it,"" Hamacek said.

Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis also attended the news conference. He said that the national intelligence services had pointed to the Russian military intelligence agency’s (GRU) involvement in the explosion at an ammunition depot in the village of Vrbetice, outside the city of Zlin in the east of the country, in 2014.

""There is well-grounded suspicion about the involvement of officers of the Russian intelligence service GRU, unit 29155, in the explosion of ammunitions depot in the Vrbetice area,"" Babis said.",257,1585,11,72
0,Hamas willing to accept less prisoner releases in exchange deal - report,https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/hamas-willing-to-accept-less-prisoner-releases-in-exchange-deal-report-665500,"Hamas may be willing to compromise on the number of prisoners released in a future exchange deal with Israel, but Israeli officials aren’t keeping their hopes up, security sources told Walla News on Sunday.

The news comes as security officials reportedly held talks with Hamas through Egyptian mediation about a week and a half ago on a possible prisoner swap, according to the report.

The talks reportedly took place while Ghassan Alian, head of the IDF unit Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, began his new job about two weeks ago. According to the report, Egyptian intelligence officers met with Israeli security officials at the Erez Crossing, and then continued into the Hamas-controlled area to speak with officials from the terrorist group.

The discussions took place over several hours, mostly concerning reaching an exchange agreement.

Security officials made it clear to Hamas that the terrorist group would need to compromise on the issue if they wanted economic progress, although representatives sent by Yahya Sinwar, leader of Hamas in Gaza, insisted on the release of hundreds of terrorists. The officials stated that “slow progress” had been made at the end of the talks, according to Walla.

Israeli officials do not have high expectations. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and National Security Council head Meir Ben Shabbat were informed about the details of the talks.

The news comes after two rockets were fired toward Israel from the Gaza Strip on Thursday night and Friday night, with the IDF responding by striking a number of targets belonging to Hamas throughout the coastal enclave.

According to Walla, security officials are still unsure who fired the rockets. According to the Palestinian WAFA news, two Palestinians were injured during the IDF response on Friday night.

On Saturday, Palestinians marked Prisoner’s Day, claiming that about 4,500 Palestinians are currently being held in Israeli prisons, and that over 5,000 Palestinians had been arrested at some point during the corona pandemic. Since the beginning of the pandemic, 367 Palestinian prisoners were infected with the virus, according to WAFA.

The Lebanese Al-Akhbar newspaper reported on Saturday that Palestinians expect about two-thirds of the Palestinians currently being held in Israeli prisons to be released once a prisoner exchange agreement is reached.

Hamas official Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook denied at the end of March that negotiations on a possible prisoner exchange had been renewed, according to Palestinian media.

Hamas is currently holding the remains of Oron Shaul and Hadar Goldin, two soldiers assumed killed in 2014’s Operation Protective Edge, as well as two civilians, Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed.",440,3051,12,72
0,Philippines commits to 75% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030,https://www.bworldonline.com/philippines-commits-to-75-reduction-in-greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-2030/,"President Rodrigo R. Duterte has approved the Philippines’ first Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) which aims to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 75% by 2030, the Finance department said on Friday.

The five-page NDC details the country’s goal of modernizing and pursuing low carbon and resilient development for the agriculture, waste, industry, transport and energy sectors over a ten-year period beginning 2020.

“The target is based on the country’s projected business-as-usual cumulative economy-wide emission of 3,340.3 metric tons (MT) of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) for the same period,” the Department of Finance said in a statement.

Of the 75% target, some 72.29% will be conditional or dependent on the support of climate finance, technologies and capacity development which is set to be provided by developed countries. The rest of the target will be implemented through domestic resources.

NDCs are at the heart of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which seeks to limit the global temperature rise to preferably below 1.5 degrees Celsius. NDCs detail the efforts of countries in reducing emissions and adapting to the impacts of climate change.

Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III, who is the chairman-designate of the Climate Change Commission (CCC), described the country’s NDC target as “ambitious.” The CCC facilitated the formulation of the NDC.

“The NDC will be our tool to upgrade our economy by adopting modern and low carbon technologies and approaches that would help mitigate the climate crisis and make our economy more resilient and our growth sustainable,” he was quoted as saying.

Based on the NDC registry of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Philippines is the latest country that has submitted its NDC, as of Thursday.

‘ACHIEVABLE’

Nazrin Camille D. Castro, manager of the Philippine branch of global non-profit The Climate Reality Project, said that the NDC will enable the country to unlock new sources of climate finance “that will help the just and equitable transition away from coal, oil, gas, and fossil fuel-based energy systems.”

“The 75% GHG reduction and avoidance target is achievable if the government could come up with formidable and bankable climate change mitigation and adaptation projects that will enable us to access international climate finance mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund,” Ms. Castro told BusinessWorld in an e-mail interview on Friday.

She added the country’s ability to reach the NDC target depends on the public and private sector’s efforts in building back better, an opportunity which the global health emergency has presented.

Albert A. Magalang, Chief of Climate Change Service at the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, said that the target is “high and ambitious”, but its fulfillment will mostly depend on support from other countries.

“The achievement of the Philippines’ 75% target would mainly depend on the support and the means of implementation that will be provided to the country as most of the mitigation target is conditional,” Mr. Magalang told BusinessWorld in an e-mail interview on Friday.

“The global health emergency may affect the level of support that will be provided from the developed countries but on the other hand, the global emissions may have also (been) reduced due to low economic activity during the pandemic,” he said, in response to a question on whether the country can reach its target given the pandemic.

Meanwhile, environment group Greenpeace Philippines described the target as “underwhelming.”

“It’s disappointing that despite strong calls from the public and environmental groups, the government barely made changes from the underwhelming target of 75% conditional and 2.71 percent unconditional emissions reduction by 2030,” Greenpeace campaigner Khevin Yu said, referring to the draft presented during the 2nd NDC Multistakeholder Consultation held in February.

“With unambitious plans for carbon-intensive sectors, the commitment does not reflect the urgency needed to address the climate emergency,” he added.

On Friday, the DoF said that crafting the NDC followed a “rigorous” process, which included economic modeling analyses, expert reviews and consultations with various stakeholders from the public, private and civil society sectors.",663,4363,11,72
0,White House dials down likelihood Russia offered bounties in Afghanistan,https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/15/russia-afghanistan-bounties-psaki-481990,"“It’s challenging to gather this intelligence and this data,” Psaki said during the daily press briefing. “While there is low-to-moderate assessment in these reports, we felt it was important for our intelligence community to look into it.”

The Kremlin has steadfastly denied the allegations that it proffered bounties though its military intelligence service, the GRU. However, Psaki said the intelligence community has higher confidence in other reports of the GRU’s involvement in the region.

“This information really puts the burden on Russian and the Russian government to explain their engagement here,” she said. “We still feel there are questions to be answered by the Russian government.”

The administration’s admission undercuts a narrative wielded by then-candidate Joe Biden against former President Donald Trump on the campaign trail. Biden repeatedly raised the possibility of Russian bounties as further evidence that Trump treated Russia with kid gloves at the expense of the military, and used it as a cudgel against him.

At the time, Trump had dismissed initial media reporting of the allegations as a “hoax” and a ""fake issue"" and later said that intelligence officials had not briefed him on the alleged bounties because they did not believe it to be credible information.

Biden had raised the bounty issue, among other topics, with Russian President Vladimir Putin in January when the two leaders held their first call together after Biden took office. The president did not bring it up during a subsequent call with Putin earlier this week, according to a summary put out by the White House.

On Thursday, Biden levied new sanctions on Putin's government and expelled 10 Russian diplomats from the United States in response to election interference, cyberespionage and other hostile actions. Some lawmakers have urged Biden to go even further, including targeting the Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany — a move that would be complicated by Germany being one of the U.S.'s key allies.

0,China opens its borders to billions of dollars of gold imports - sources,https://www.reuters.com/world/china/exclusive-china-opens-its-borders-billions-dollars-gold-imports-sources-2021-04-16/,"China has given domestic and international banks permission to import large amounts of gold into the country, five sources familiar with the matter said, potentially helping to support global gold prices after months of declines.

China is the world's biggest gold consumer, gobbling up hundreds of tonnes of the precious metal worth tens of billions of dollars each year, but its imports plunged as the coronavirus spread and local demand dried up.

With China's economy rebounding strongly since the second half of last year, demand for gold jewellery, bars and coins has recovered, driving domestic prices above global benchmark rates and making it profitable to import bullion. read more

The local premium is now about $7 to $9 an ounce, according to gold traders in Asia, and would probably have increased further if more imports to satisfy demand had not been allowed.

About 150 tonnes of gold worth $8.5 billion at current prices is likely to be shipped following the green light from Beijing, four sources said. Two said the gold would be shipped in April and two said it would arrive over April and May.

The bulk of China's gold imports typically comes from Australia, South Africa and Switzerland.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC), the country's central bank, controls how much gold enters China through a system of quotas given to commercial banks. It usually allows metal in but sometimes restricts flows.

""We had no quotas for a while. Now we are getting them ... the most since 2019,"" said a source at one of the banks moving gold into China.

The PBOC did not respond to a request for comment.

The size of the shipments signals China's dramatic return to the global bullion market. Since February 2020, the country has on average imported gold worth about $600 million a month, or roughly 10 tonnes, Chinese customs data show.

In 2019, its imports ran at about $3.5 billion a month, or roughly 75 tonnes.

China's absence made little difference to gold prices early in the pandemic when Western investors fearful of economic catastrophe stockpiled vast amounts of the safe-haven asset, pushing it to a record high of $2,072.50 an ounce.

But the investor interest drifted away as vaccines and government stimulus programmes revived economic growth and gold prices have sagged to around $1,750 an ounce.

India's demand for bullion has also rebounded from a pandemic-induced slump, with record-breaking imports in March of 160 tonnes of gold, an Indian government source told Reuters this month. read more

China and India typically account for some two fifths of the world's annual demand for gold.

Their recovery is ""critical in setting the floor for gold"" and should stop prices from falling further over the coming months, said Suki Cooper, an analyst at Standard Chartered.

Jewellery sales in China during the Lunar New Year holiday in February were stronger than in 2019 and 2020 and manufacturers and retailers needed to replenish their stocks, said Philip Klapwijk at Precious Metals Insights, a consultancy in Hong Kong.

""A pretty decent recovery in gold demand this year will require a generally much higher level of gold imports (than in 2020),"" he said.

0,The Honduran president used Facebook to massively inflate his popularity,https://contracorriente.red/en/2021/04/16/the-honduran-president-used-facebook-to-massively-inflate-his-popularity-an-interview-with-sophie-zhang/,"Responding to Zhang’s accusations about Facebook’s priorities, a spokesperson, Liz Bourgeois claimed, “We aggressively go after abuse around the world … As a result, we’ve taken down more than 100 networks of coordinated inauthentic behavior. Around half of them were in networks that operated in countries around the world, including Latin America, the Middle East, and North Africa, and in the Asia region.”

We spoke to Zhang by phone about what she learned about President Juan Orlando Hernández’s use of Facebook, and the potential broader implications of that sort of abuse of social media. This interview has been edited and condensed.

CC: How did you work out that Hernández was falsely inflating his post popularity?

SZ: So it was very silly. I was working for Facebook as a data scientist, on the fake engagement team. By fake, I mean things like fake accounts, hacked accounts, self compromised ones where you give your credentials over to someone else. It was things like people buying fake likes. There are small businesses who want more fans, there are influencers who want more fans. There are spammers who are selling questionable products like air purifiers that will keep you safe from Covid. My job was supposed to be getting rid of this sort of fake activity.

This other work (uncovering political fake engagement), I was doing in my spare time, or spare moments at work. From the start, I was interested in the idea of inauthentic activity acting on politics, and so I started looking for it. I found it in countries like India and Brazil, and in Honduras. Actually, a lot of it in Honduras, relative to its size. I took a screenshot of one of Hernández’s posts and I realized it was very odd, because there were a lot of (Facebook) Pages liking his post. As I looked closer, it was very clear what was going on, and it was very clear it was very bad. I had never seen anything like this before.

CC: What was Hernández doing?

SZ: There were very clearly fake Pages pretending to be real people who didn’t exist, but which were being used to manipulate, in favor of the president of Honduras. And the person running these fake pages was actually one of the page administrators of the president of Honduras. This person had been authorized to have access to the official page of Juan Orlando Hernández, and to make posts on his behalf.

There were thousands of fake Pages. In terms of the activity, I don’t remember the exact volume numbers, but I do remember that in late 2018 and early 2019, roughly half of the activity such as likes, comments. and shares came from fake pages. That’s from memory. It was quite significant.

And it’s actually not that hard (to set up fake Pages). When you make a new account, Facebook goes through a process that ensures that people can’t set up new fake accounts. But it didn’t occur to people (at Facebook) to apply the same concept to Pages. So they could just make a Page, find a profile picture somewhere, make up a name, make another Page, and so on. This has advantages and disadvantages when compared to networks of fake accounts. It can be quite hard to control 50 different accounts because you can only be logged into one at a time in one browser. So maybe I need to have lots of devices, or to keep logging out and in. Whereas switching between pages is much easier, because Facebook set it up so that page administrators, such as people hired to take care of pages for corporations or political parties, can do so easily. On the flip side, it’s very obvious internally, to Facebook, (when people are doing this).

CC: Essentially, it is about manufacturing credibility, right? Is that different to digital advertising or native advertising?

SZ: Yes, essentially. I’m not an expert in politics, so what I’m telling you is more educated speculation. But what I can say is that (the fake engagements and Pages) certainly did make the president (of Honduras) appear to be much more popular than he actually was.

There has been a lot of research about perception, and often what is found is that countries that are on the brink of crisis, countries that might be ruled by dictators who might be facing coups or uprisings – in these regions, perception can be more important than reality.

For example, everyone may hate the dictator, but pretend to still support him (sic), because if they think everyone else does, they will be too afraid of the consequences of (speaking out). And when they are protesting in the streets, when there’s an uprising, the officials and soldiers have to decide who they are going to support.

Ultimately, dictators need not just to be popular, but for people to believe that they are popular.

It’s not the same as advertising, because paying for advertising makes people see that (content) more, but these people can still make their own decisions about what they like and don’t like. But when it comes to falsely inflating popularity, these aren’t real people. I would compare it to when politicians bus in supporters to rallies, because if they didn’t do that, there wouldn’t be any crowds at their events and they would look like failures.

CC: There are national elections coming up in Honduras in November, is it likely that the National Party will continue to try this strategy, even though Facebook has taken down some pages?

SZ: I know that after Facebook took the pages down, a year after I discovered them, (Hernandez´s team) tried to come back with more pages. Facebook immediately stopped them. After, I know they came back using a different tactic of using fake accounts. These were much harder to discover. When I identified them, Facebook was very reluctant to take many of them down. It was still continuing when I left. I can’t say what has happened since I left, or what will happen in the future, but frankly I think it makes sense for them to continue (to employ fake engagement).

CC: Why has Facebook been so slow to act on this?

SZ: It’s a hard question to answer because I can’t read minds and I don’t know what motivates decisions. But what I was often told then, and what I believed at the time but I don’t believe any more, is that there was this loophole (of using Facebook Pages). We hadn’t seen anything like this before. The Honduran government was being cutting edge. So it wasn’t contemplated in the rules, is what I was told. There wasn’t a clear rule against fake Pages.

The reason I don’t believe that explanation any more is that I thought the precedent of Honduras would make a difference. By October 2019 we had a new policy that recognized that Pages could be used for coordinated inauthentic behavior.

Still, I don’t know, I can only guess. And what I believe is that it was a combination of factors. Facebook does take action regarding cases in smaller countries, but usually it’s because someone there, like an NGO or opposition group, has complained to the company. That means those outside people know what is happening and they could go to the media about it. But I was acting within the company, and so it was treated very differently.

Ultimately, Facebook is a company, and it’s goal is to make money. It isn’t interested in issues out of the goodness of its heart. In some cases, what it acts on is about luck, and in other cases I think it is about how important the country is perceived to be. I’m sorry to say it, but Honduras is a small country and it isn’t very wealthy, so I think it wasn’t considered as important to Facebook’s bottom line.

I think people have very high expectations of social media companies. In part because social media companies like to portray themselves as very nice and well-intentioned, and in part because they believe the existing institutions have failed. They don’t expect the government to fix the problem, and ironically that’s because many of the traditional gatekeepers, like the media, have been weakened by social media.

CC: Finally, what can people do?

SZ: I think publishing news articles is important. It is one of the pressure points that Facebook listens to, I know. And at the end of the day if people stop using Facebook it will have no more power, but that’s not likely to happen. But if people threaten to leave Facebook, I think the company would take that seriously. I know Honduras is a small country, but there are other countries who are experiencing similar things in Latin America. So if Facebook doesn’t clean up its act, in terms of cracking down on inauthentic behavior networks, people can threaten to leave, but it requires people to act together in great numbers.",1498,8587,10,72
0,"Russia ‘threatening Ukraine with destruction’, Kyiv says | Conflict News",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/15/russia-threatening-ukraine-with-destruction-kyiv-says,"The foreign minister’s comments come as his counterparts from the Baltic nations visit Kyiv in a show of solidarity.

Ukraine’s foreign minister has accused Russia of flagrantly threatening Ukraine with destruction as fears continue to rise over a possible escalation of hostilities in the country’s conflict-stricken east.

Fighting has intensified in recent weeks in Ukraine’s Donetsk and Lugansk regions, where government forces have battled Russian-backed separatists since April 2014 after the rebels seized a swath of territory there.

Meanwhile, Russia has amassed tens of thousands of troops as well as tanks and artillery near the shared border in the region. Moscow has also mobilised troops in the annexed Black Sea region of Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in March 2014.

Addressing a news conference on Thursday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba condemned the Kremlin’s “aggravation of the security situation” and accused Russian pundits and officials of “openly threatening Ukraine with war and the destruction of Ukrainian statehood”.

“Moscow’s actions and statements [are] aimed at escalating military tensions and undermining diplomatic efforts to resolve the Russian-Ukrainian conflict,” he said.

Kuleba also warned Moscow against initiating any incursion into Ukraine, stating any intensification of the escalation in the Donbas region, of which Donetsk and Lugansk are a part, would have “very painful” consequences for Russia.

“The red line of Ukraine is the state border. If Russia crosses the red line, then it will have to suffer,” he said. “The world is on the side of Ukraine and international law.”

Baltic nations rally around Ukraine

Kuleba’s warning came as the foreign ministers of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia arrived in Ukraine on Thursday morning in a show of solidarity in the face of the Russian military buildup.

Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told reporters that “Ukraine will never be on its own”.

“We stand with you, we stand in solidarity,” he said.

Russia has previously said its troop movements pose no threat and are merely defensive. It has also stated the military units would remain in position as long as the Kremlin saw fit.

But the buildup has alarmed Ukraine’s allies, prompting calls from NATO for Russian President Vladimir Putin to order a pullback.

On Wednesday, NATO members Germany and the United States urged Moscow to reverse course and de-escalate the situation in the region.

A day earlier, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg urged Russia to end its “unjustified” military buildup.

While Kyiv has welcomed the shows of Western support, they fall short of Ukraine’s desire for full NATO membership – which Moscow opposes.

Moscow blames NATO, US

Moscow has refused to change tack, and this week blamed NATO and the US for turning Ukraine into a “powder keg” with increasing arms supplies to the country.

The Kremlin has repeatedly denied interfering in Donbas, but Ukraine and several Western countries have said separatist forces in the region have been armed, led, funded and aided by Russia.

On Tuesday, in the first public description of the military buildup, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said Moscow had moved two army and three paratrooper units to its western border as part of a large snap drill meant to test combat readiness and respond to what he called threatening military action by NATO.

Shoigu said on state television that the three-week exercise was due to wrap up in the next two weeks.

He also claimed NATO was deploying 40,000 troops and 15,000 pieces of military equipment near Russia’s borders, mainly in the Black Sea and the Baltic regions. NATO denies having made such plans.

Russia has previously accused NATO of destabilising Europe with its troop reinforcements in the Baltics and Poland since the annexation of Crimea, which came after an uprising that toppled former Kremlin-friendly Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.",621,3979,10,72
0,Brazil asks women 'if possible' to delay pregnancy over COVID-19 variants,https://cnnphilippines.com/world/2021/4/18/Brazil-advice-pregnancy-COVID-19-variants.html,"(CNN) — Brazil has warned women to postpone pregnancy until the worst of the coronavirus pandemic has passed, saying that the variants of the coronavirus in Brazil have been more aggressive in pregnant women.

""If possible, (the women should) postpone the pregnancy a bit to a better time so that (they) can have a more peaceful pregnancy,"" Secretary of Primary Health Care of the Brazilian health ministry Raphael Camara said Friday. ""We cannot say this to those who are 42, 43 years old, of course, but for a young woman who can, the best thing is to wait for a little,"" he said during a press conference.

Brazil is second only to the US in terms of Covid-19 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University, with 368,749 deaths and more than 13.8 million cases. Cities across the country have been hit hard by a recent surge in Covid-19 cases and deaths, fueled in part by new variants believed to be extra contagious and some Brazilians' disregard for social distancing precautions.

The country could be headed for even worse times thanks to a combination of political chaos and inaction, a team of public health experts warned this week.

""In Brazil, the federal response has been a dangerous combination of inaction and wrongdoing, including the promotion of chloroquine as treatment despite a lack of evidence,"" a team led by Marcia Castro of the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, experts at the University of São Paulo and elsewhere wrote in their report, published in the journal Science.

Researchers argued that ""prompt and equitable"" responses from the federal government could have helped contain the outbreak and protect the most vulnerable -- but leaders have failed, and are still failing, to do so.

In the city of Manaus, a spike in severe cases led to hospital systems collapsing, with a shortage of oxygen for patients.

""Without immediate action, this could be a preview of what is yet to happen in other localities in Brazil,"" the team warned. Unless the government took immediate action, conducted epidemiological and genomic surveillance measures, and stepped up vaccinations, the spread of variants will likely lead to ""unimaginable loss of lives.""

Camara said Friday that the ministry is working on studies on the issue of pregnancy and variants.

""We do not have a national or international study, but the clinical view of experts shows that the new variant has a more aggressive action on pregnant women,"" he said. ""Before, [severity] was linked to the end of the pregnancy, but now (they) see a more serious evolution in the second trimester and even in the first trimester,"" he added.

Pregnant women in UK can get jab

Meanwhile, the UK's vaccine advisers said pregnant women ""of any age"" in the country can be offered either the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna Covid-19 vaccines.

""Although clinical trials on the use of COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy are not advanced, the available data do not indicate any harm to pregnancy,"" Friday's updated guidance said. ""JCVI [The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation] has therefore advised that women who are pregnant should be offered vaccination at the same time as non-pregnant women, based on their age and clinical risk group.""

The guidance further said that ""there is now extensive post-marketing experience of the use of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines in the USA with no safety signals so far. These vaccines are therefore the preferred vaccines to offer to pregnant women.""

""Pregnant women who commenced vaccination with AstraZeneca, however, are advised to complete with the same vaccine.""

Managers from Nasa and Elon Musk’s space company on Friday (NZT) cleared the Falcon rocket and Dragon capsule for a dawn liftoff with a crew of four to the International Space Station.

They will spend six months at the orbiting lab, replacing another SpaceX crew that’s close to coming home.

The rocket and capsule were designed for reuse. The rocket was used to launch the current station crew last November from Nasa's Kennedy Space Centre.

0,Students evacuate Cape Town university as fire damages historic buildings,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/19/cape-town-fire-table-mountain-evacuate-university-jagger-library,"A wildfire raging on the slopes of Cape Town’s Table Mountain has spread to the University of Cape Town, burning the historic campus library and forcing the evacuation of 4,000 students.

Orange flames lit up the windows of the library, which houses considerable archives and book collections while firefighters sprayed jets of water to douse the blaze.

The reading room at the university’s historic Jagger library was “gutted” according to UCT Library executive director Ujala Satgoor, but the fire detection system was triggered, “preventing the spread of the fire to other parts of the library.” Some valuable collections had been lost, she said.

Other campus buildings also caught fire, and a historic windmill nearby burned. The thatch-roofed Mostert’s Mill, built in 1796, is the country’s oldest working windmill.

Just off-campus on the slopes of Table Mountain, wind spread the flames across dry brush, and part of the Rhodes Memorial Restaurant caught fire, Cape Town media reported. SANParks, which runs Table Mountain national park, said it believed that the fire had been started accidentally by a homeless person.

Dan Plato, mayor of the City of Cape Town, said, “It is tragic that literary treasures have been lost at the UCT library, but I have been informed that some of the most valuable works were saved by the quick activation of roller doors. Our attention and support remains with firefighters and all role players working to protect further loss of property.”

More than 100 firefighters and emergency personnel were deployed to the university campus and to Table Mountain national park. Four helicopters were being used to drop water on threatened areas, officials said.

One firefighter was injured and being treated at a hospital, according to the Cape Town fire and rescue department.

Table Mountain national park fire manager Philip Prins said in a statement that the fire had spread particularly rapidly because of the mountain’s “very old pine trees and their debris. The fire created its own wind that further increased the rate of spread”.

“The excessive amount of smoke and related updrafts made it impossible for the aerial support to slow the spread.”

Residents have been cautioned to be on alert, Charlotte Powell, spokesperson for the city’s disaster risk management centre, said in a statement.

“At this stage, there’s no cause to evacuate, but we ask that residents adhere to the following: close all windows to prevent draft and reduce heat, damp down your garden using a hose or irrigation system,” Powell said.

Images of library buildings burning from the inside alarmed students, academics, writers and artists – some of whom have stored archival materials in the libraries.

Satgoor said that despite the fire detection system protecting much of the library, “some of our valuable collections have been lost, however a full assessment can only be done once the building has been declared safe”.

“I write this message with a deep sense of sorrow and devastation at the loss,” Satgoor wrote in a statement posted to Twitter. “Some of us watched, from on site, with horror and helplessness this elegant and historical library burn”. A restoration of the Jagger reading room began in 2011, according to the library’s website.

The Jagger library houses the university’s Special Collections library, which houses priceless archival material, including rare books, manuscripts, photographs and documents such as anti-Apartheid pamphlets. Some of these have been digitised.

Table Mountain national park called on social media for hikers to leave the area and for motorists to remove cars parked in the vicinity.

A first alert went up shortly before 9am (0700 GMT), city authorities said.

Three helicopters joined the fight, dumping water on the inferno, they added.

The University’s vice-chancellor, Prof Mamokgethi Phakeng, said in a statement that “all academic activities will be suspended [Monday] and on Tuesday”. Food and accommodation had been provided for all evacuated students, she said, and arrangements had been made to accommodate Muslim students, who are fasting for Ramadan.

The United States hopes to restore its shattered credibility when it hosts a climate change summit next week by pledging to cut its greenhouse emissions by at least half and securing agreements from allies for faster reductions, according to two sources familiar with the matter.

A 50% reduction from 2005 levels by 2030 is a minimum level urged by environmental groups, hundreds of corporations and European Union lawmakers. It would be the first upgrade of the U.S. climate target since 2015, when former President Barack Obama pledged a 26%-28% reduction by 2025.

Washington was also close to clinching deals with the governments of Japan, South Korea and Canada to accelerate their targets to decarbonize, the two sources said. It was not immediately clear if those nations would make announcements at the event, and representatives of those countries have not commented on the discussions.

The stakes for the meeting are high. Leaders from roughly 40 countries including China, India, Brazil and Russia have been invited, with hopes they will double down on past pledges to reduce climate warming emissions. So far, international pledges to decarbonize would shave only 1% off global emissions by 2030 compared with 2010 levels, a fraction of what scientists say is needed to avert the worst impacts of climate change.

The virtual summit on April 22-23, kicking off on Earth Day, will be an opportunity for Democratic President Joe Biden to reclaim U.S. leadership in global climate efforts, after four years during which his predecessor, Republican Donald Trump, downplayed the issue to support the oil and coal industries.

Biden's climate envoy, John Kerry, has spent the last few months on countless Zoom appearances and on a globe-hopping tour, concluding this week in China and South Korea, to persuade countries to use next week's summit to hike their commitments to protect the planet.

The Biden administration has been laying the groundwork for its new target, unveiling a $2 trillion infrastructure package to expand clean energy and transport. read more

The European Union last year agreed to reduce its net emissions at least 55% by 2030 from 1990 levels - currently the most ambitious among big emitters.

""All eyes are on the Biden summit next week as a key moment for John Kerry’s diplomatic skills to be put to work in aligning all countries with a halving of emissions in this decade, as science demands,"" said Christiana Figueres, former executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

PATIENCE WEARING THIN

Next week's U.S. summit is the first in a string of meetings of world leaders - including the G7 and G20 - ahead of the United Nations climate summit in November, known as COP26. That serves as the deadline for nearly 200 countries to update their climate pledges under the Paris Agreement, an international accord set in 2015 to combat global warming.

But as global powers tussle over percentage points, in countries already facing the impacts of a warming world, patience is wearing thin.

Developing countries – many of which are vulnerable to rising seas, heatwaves and rainfall made more severe by climate change – are expected to offer their own goals at the summit, said Pablo Vieira, director of the NDC Partnership, which has been helping developing nations craft their climate targets.

They will also repeat their demand that rich nations offer more money to help them cut emissions and adapt to the impacts it is already unleashing in countries like Bangladesh, South Sudan and the Marshall Islands.

YOU'RE ALL INVITED

U.S. talks with Japan, South Korea and Canada have focused on trying to get each country to commit to cut emissions at least 50% by 2030, according to the two sources familiar with the U.S. negotiations.

Japan and South Korea both rely on coal for power generation and winding that dependence down and their finance of coal plants abroad could yield significant emissions cuts in the next 10 years, the sources said.

Canada may have a tougher challenge.

""We don’t have quite that luxury here because coal is a much smaller part of our grid,"" Canada's Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said. But he added: ""We are working to stretch as far as we can.”

Canada, which has a large oil industry, currently has a target to cut emissions 30% below 2005 levels by 2030.

Other major emitters appear less keen to take the plunge, including India, China, Brazil and Russia.

India, the third-largest emitting country behind China and the United States, is resisting because it expects more developed nations to take on the bulk of global reductions.

“What we are suffering today is caused a 100 years ago,” said Prakash Javadekar, India’s Minister of Environment, Forest & Climate Change, pointing to emissions from the United States and Europe. “Historical responsibility is a very important aspect. We cannot just forget it.”

China’s special climate envoy, Xie Zhenhua, was meeting with Kerry in Shanghai this week to discuss climate change, the foreign ministry said. China promised last year that its greenhouse gas output would peak by 2030, a target environmental groups say is insufficient.

U.S. and Brazilian officials, meanwhile, have been working since February on a billion-dollar deal to fund Brazil's protection of the Amazon rainforest, but diplomatic sources said a deal is unlikely by April 22.

Russia, another big emitter, has not yet confirmed if President Vladimir Putin will participate in the summit. With Moscow's ties with the West at a post-Cold War low, the U.S. summit has generated little buzz in Russia.

0,An Ecosystem on the Rise: The Future of Cloud Kitchens in the Philippines,https://www.esquiremag.ph/money/industry/the-future-of-cloud-kitchens-in-the-philippines-a00304-20210415-lfrm?ref=home_featured_big,"The global F&B industry continues to grapple with the effects of the pandemic and lockdown, but one innovation that’s slowly gaining ground is the cloud kitchen, a new model that disrupting and saving how we serve food.

Cloud kitchens have been popping up around the world, with China reportedly having the most out of any country. The Philippine cloud kitchen ecosystem is still in its infancy stage, yet local startups like CloudEats and MadEats have already bagged millions of pesos in investments. Other notable players include GrabKitchen from the Grab app and the Mercato United Kitchen, created by and for the MSMEs that participated in the food market pre-lockdown. The Dubai cloud kitchen Kitopi is also looking to expand into the Southeast Asian region.

But one player that’s leading the herd is Kraver’s Canteen, a one-year-old startup that recently secured $1.5 million (about P72.7 million) in seed funding from Foxmont Capital Partners, JG Summit CEO Lance Gokongwei, co-founder of Grab Brian Cu, Co-founder of Zalora Paolo Campos III, Century Pacific chairman Christopher Po, and Rico’s Lechon president George Pua.

What is a cloud kitchen?

Think of it like a digital food court where customers can purchase food from more than one brand. This is made possible by the cloud kitchen model, which lets brands share one large kitchen, similar to a co-working space. Unlike a traditional brick-and-mortar establishment, cloud kitchens don’t have a dine-in or front-of-the-house function. It relies solely on deliveries, partnering with third-party delivery apps, which in the Philippines are mainly Grab, Foodpanda, and Pick-a-Roo.

Since cloud kitchens don’t have a dine-in area, they don’t require all the expenses that come with having a front-of-the-house, cutting costs drastically.

“You can actually open a cloud kitchen at 10 or 20 percent of the cost that it would take to build and entirely new establishment. Of course a big part of the expenses (of a brick-and-mortar restaurant) is the frontage, the branding, the dine-in [area]. But under the cloud kitchen model, you only need to work on the small kitchen area where you can only build things you need to service the customers,” explained Kraver’s Canteen co-founder and general manager Victor Lim to ANC.

Instead of building an entire shop, brands can rent a space in a cloud kitchen where cooks can store, cook, assemble, and deliver orders like clockwork.

Who benefits the most from a cloud kitchen?

Cloud kitchens serve both brands and customers. On the brand side, cloud kitchens offer online restaurants a growth opportunity to build their delivery base, which has been a lifeline for many in the F&B industry during the pandemic. This is particularly true for online restaurants that had to close during lockdown but found a second life operating from a cloud kitchen and making the full shift online.

The model also offers a chance for online-only food brands that were built by day-workers who decided to make a business in their free time. Instead of having to cook from home or set aside a huge sum to build a store, new food entrepreneur for trs can go the cloud kitchen route to build their customer base.

Major F&B players are also keen on entering the cloud kitchen ecosystem, such as Kraver’s Canteen’s newest brand partner: Bench Group. Bench’s Tonkatsu Maisen cloud kitchen recently launched with Kraver’s Canteen, which also plans to add 20 other major brands to their roster, including Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and Dairy Queen, all of which are under PPI Holdings Inc. of the Araneta Group.

As for the customers, cloud kitchens allow you to cross-order when you’re craving more than one cuisine or type of food. For example, you can order tacos from one brand and sushi from another but have both delivered together as they’re both cooked in the same cloud kitchen. This is particularly convenient if you’re hosting small get togethers and everyone wants a different thing. The added convenience is the only difference on the side of the customer, who only really care about the food they’re getting but not where it’s made.

“When you order, for example, Shakey’s, you don’t know if it’s coming from a mall, the food court, food truck or stand-alone restaurant. Cloud kitchens are just another aspect and channel for these brands to sell their brands. For the customer, it’s not about where it’s coming from but which brand it’s coming from,” explained Lim.

The Future of Cloud Kitchens

Cloud kitchens are the future of food, and there’s no doubt about it. While the concept existed pre-pandemic, it’s necessity was urged by lockdowns that forced the food industry to innovate. Cloud kitchens around the world have grown in number exponentially in the last few months, and it’s estimated that the global cloud kitchen market will grow at a CAGR of 12 percent from 2021 to 2027. In just six years, the market value of the industry is expected to be over $71.4 billion. That’s almost double its value from 2019, which was $43.1 billion.

“By our guess, the delivery and takeout market in the Philippines is somewhere between P4 billion to P5 billion dollars, so there’s certainly potential [in the industry],” said Lim.

Lockdown has only grown and nurtured the delivery culture, and it’s expected that takeout demand will remain stable even when the option to dine-in will return post-pandemic. The reasoning is simple: cloud kitchens weren’t made to replace restaurant stores, but to enhance the growth opportunities of food brands.

“As more customers begin to eat-out more and office life resumes, we’ll likely see a shift in customer behavior, yes, but overall expect minimal impact to sales. It’s important to remember that cloud kitchens are not designed to replace the brick-and-mortar experience, they are designed more as an expansion tool for brands to take advantage of the growing pie created by delivery aggregators,” said Eric Dee, co-founder of Kraver’s Canteen and president of Foodee Global Concepts.

ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW

“Ordering food online is a consumer behavior that is here to stay, and as long as customers are ordering, the cloud kitchen ecosystem will continue to grow. Whether consumers notice this or not, more of the food they order to their home or office will be coming from cloud kitchens over time.”

As major brands under Bench Group and Foodee adopt cloud kitchen options, so is mega-conglomerate Jollibee Food Corp., the country’s leading food enterprise. JFC has turned its attentions abroad as it aims to become one of the world’s top five restaurant brands, and its launching cloud kitchens internationally as part of its expansion plan. JFC has already opened cloud kitchens in Singapore and Chicago, and has allotted $138 million (P7 billion) to its global cloud kitchen initiative.

The regional state of cloud kitchens is also growing, with many new players emerging in Southeast Asia. In Indonesia where Gojek reigns supreme, the super app had partnered with Rebel Foods. GrabFood Indonesia has also partnered with cloud kitchen startup Yummy Corp. In Singapore, Smart City Kitchens, TiffinLabs, and Grain are popular cloud kitchen players. And in Malaysia, Cookhouse and Pop Meals are part of the cloud kitchen scene.

ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW

The Philippine cloud kitchen system is still in its early days, and to some, still “underdeveloped.” According to Lim, some local could kitchens are more focused on creating their own food brands than developing the ecosystem. So far, most cloud kitchens are still focused on the Metro Manila area. That could soon change as Kraver’s Canteen plans to build 100 cloud kitchens across the Philippines to service brands in major urban areas in the provinces, like Cebu, Cagayan de Oro, Iloilo, and Davao.

Soon, the digital food court could expand nationwide and help revive the struggling F&B industry.

Noise pollution from ship engines, trawling activities, oil platforms, subsea mining and other human sources declined significantly last spring, say the researchers, who are part of a collaborative network of 231 non-military hydrophones.

They believe the relative hush can provide valuable comparative data for an unplanned experiment in how sound affects whales, coral and other marine species.

Like light pollution on the land, human noise is a growing concern in the oceans because it has been proven to disrupt species that depend on sound for communication and navigation. Low-frequency signals can travel thousands of kilometres.

Studies in the north-east Pacific showed an increase of 3 decibels each decade in human-generated sounds below 100 hertz between the 1960s and early 2000s. By one reckoning, the volume of this audio pollution is now around the same level as the natural background noise of the ocean.

This faded substantially last year at the height of lockdown in March, April and May, starting – like Covid – around China and then spreading worldwide. The volume surged back to a new height in the summer as shipping companies rushed to make up for lost time. Sound levels have now stabilised close to the average for recent years.

Scientists have retrospectively declared 2020 “the year of the quiet ocean” and the data from this exceptional period will be published in the coming months in scientific journals.

“Be prepared for exciting results,” said Jesse Ausubel, the director of the Program for the Human Environment at the Rockefeller University. The oceans are unlikely to be as quiet as during April 2020 for many decades to come.

The softening of human sound was most evident in coastal areas and shipping lanes. Jennifer Miksis-Olds, the director of the Center for Acoustics Research and Education at the University of New Hampshire, said this created conditions for a “natural experiment. Since the Industrial Revolution, she said, human noise has masked the ambient sounds of wind, waves and ice and forced marine life to adapt in a similar way to customers in a noisy restaurant, who have to raise their voices or repeat themselves to be understood.

This is part of a bigger project. Ausubel is the founder of the International Quiet Ocean Experiment, a 10-year plan launched in 2015 to create a time series of measurements of ambient sound in many ocean locations. Part of the goal is create evidence to persuade ship operators, oil and gas facilities and jetski users to dampen their decibels for the sake of marine ecosystems.

“We’d like the word soundscape to become a lot better known. Sound is light in the oceans. It illuminates the ocean for many animals. They use it to communicate, to hunt, and can be harmed by noise at excess,” Ausubel said.

He and colleagues – including specialists at St Andrews – plan to expand the hydrophone network, particularly in the southern hemisphere, to more than 500 devices. Using modelling and data collaborations with shipping companies and other ocean users, they hope to produce a global map of ocean sound within the coming years. This should reveal important patterns, such as increases in noise along shipping lanes and near oilfields and windfarms, which could prove as important for ocean health and regulation as roadside air pollution monitoring, or water-contamination measurements near factories.

There is a long way to go. Currently, there are relatively detailed soundscapes of busy areas, such as the North Sea, and then piecemeal, one-off studies from other regions. Filling in the gaps will require a major effort to share data and make reporting consistent across time and place.

Two important steps in this direction were announced this week with the launch of a new software tool, known as Manta (Making Ambient Noise Trends Accessible) and developed by an international team of experts coordinated by Miksis-Olds, to standardise ocean sound recording data. There have also been tests of a new platform to share acoustic data worldwide, the Open Portal to Underwater Sound (Opus), which is being hosted by the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany.

Ausubel compared the recent developments in the soundscape network to the completion of a ring of satellites around the equator in 1979.

0,Industry says Canada's 'toxic' label on plastic will scare off investment,https://www.plasticsnews.com/news/industry-says-canadas-toxic-label-plastic-will-scare-investment,"The plastics industry used an April 12 government hearing in Canada to strongly push back against a proposal to declare plastic products ""toxic"" under Canadian environmental laws, saying it would deter investment.

While the online hearing in Parliament saw lengthy debates around how best to tackle plastic waste, leaders of Canada's plastics trade association and the CEO of Husky Injection Molding Systems Ltd. said the tougher rules could put a brake on growth.

""We have largely become a flyover destination for chemistry sector investment … and the listing of all plastic manufactured items as toxic will exacerbate that,"" said Bob Masterson, president and CEO of the Chemistry Industry Association of Canada.

The industry was reacting to a broad plan from the Canadian government, first made in October, that would officially declare plastic a toxin regulated under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.

Other parts of the plan seek to ban single-use disposable products including retail bags, straws and cutlery, as well as make it a national priority to tackle plastic waste with recycled content standards and producer responsibility.

But it was the idea to list plastics under CEPA that seemed to generate the most pointed concern from industry at the hearing in front of the Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable Development.

Government officials say the CEPA label would give agencies more tools and authority to manage plastic along its life cycle.

But plastics executives say it will scare away funding that would drive future jobs and growth, including in making plastics more recyclable.

""The biggest economic impact that will arise from the proposed federal actions will be the effect on future investment opportunities,"" Masterson said. ""We think it sends a very negative signal to the global industry to list all plastic manufactured items as CEPA toxic. It sends a message that Canada's ambivalent at best, if not actually in opposition to, growth and investment in the sector.""

He told Parliament that the petrochemical sector in the United States has attracted $300 billion in investment in the last six years.

But Canada, with about 10 percent of the population of the U.S., has not attracted the $30 billion he said it should have.

""We've seen very little of that here and we should have seen more,"" Masterson said.

Elena Mantagaris, vice president of plastics for Ottawa-based CIAC, said smaller plastics processing or recycling companies are questioning what the federal listing and bans would do to their business plans.

In particular, she mentioned an unnamed Montreal plastic bag recycling firm that said a ban on bags would shift investment to the U.S.

""I think many of our members are questioning whether future investments in this country are feasible, whether it's in the recycling sector or just in the plastics production sector in general,"" she said, estimating that large-scale plastic product bans in Canada could cost at least 13,000 jobs and likely more.

Similarly, Husky President and CEO John Galt said he's aware of a PET packaging and recycling firm that's put investments on hold, and he argued that others are making similar calculations.

""Since this legislation has been [introduced], Husky and many of our customers and co-suppliers to the industry have put our investments in Canada on hold,"" Galt said. ""The right solution, in my opinion, is to engage our industry and its 1,700 small and medium-sized businesses in the solution. The development of the circular economy will create jobs.""

The Canadian plan has also drawn criticism from the U.S. industry. The Plastics Industry Association in Washington reiterated in response to the hearing that it sees the CEPA designation as a nontariff trade barrier that will disrupt $12 billion in cross-border trade in plastics.",613,3856,11,73

The new, more contagious Brazilian variant, known as P1, seems to be affecting younger people with no pre-existing comorbidities.

Advertising Read more

More than half the patients in Brazilian intensive care units in March were under 40 years old, according to the Brazilian Association of Resuscitation Physicians. The more contagious Covid-19 variant known as P1 is claiming younger victims every day, many with no prior medical issues.

Between January and March the death toll among those between 30 and 39 jumped 353 percent, according to the latest report from the Covid-19 Observatory. At the headquarters of the Fiocruz medical institute, chief pulmonologist Margareth Dalcolmo, who is coordinating the study on the new variant, says not a day goes by without seeing more alarming numbers. And one key question: Why does the Brazilian variant claim more victims among young people?

Dalcolmo and her colleagues already have some clues. ""The profile of seriously ill patients has changed. First, because of the evolution of the pandemic and the lack of lockdown measures, we see more and more young people in the streets. They are the ones who have to go to work and who cannot stand the absence of a social life any longer. So they meet in bars,” she says.

In short, Dalcolmo says, it is not that the new variant prefers young people, but it is the youth who go out and are therefore more exposed.

Widespread poverty has also proven to be a key factor. A monthly government allowance of around €50 per household, introduced at the start of the pandemic, is too low to meet the needs of the poorest families. Faced with this situation, families do the best they can: grandparents stay at home to take care of the grandchildren while parents find themselves outdoors, often congregating on public transport to look for work, predominantly informal jobs.

“It's easy to say to young Brazilians, 'Stay home'. But in practice, and with 20 percent of the population below the poverty line, they have to go out to earn a living,” says Dalcolmo.

Further complicating matters, Brazil has experienced delays in its vaccination rollout due to supply and distribution problems. Only around 8 million people, or 3.8 percent of the population, have so far been fully vaccinated.

‘We cannot stop living’

President Jair Bolsonaro has refused to introduce nationwide lockdown measures. It is therefore left up to individual state governors and mayors to decide for themselves. In a vast country of 27 separate states it has become impossible to have a homogeneous and coherent health policy. Even as São Paulo shuts down, bars and restaurants in Rio de Janeiro were allowed to reopen last weekend until 9pm.

After 14 days of forced closure, the streets of Lapa in Rio are lively. Civil police officers who are on patrol between two crowded terraces look concerned. ""This reopening, I think that's what makes the pandemic gain ground,"" says deputy inspector Gama. Over the past two weeks, Gama and his team have monitored or shut down more than 17,000 bars, social gatherings and underground parties.

The Instagram account @Brasilfedecovid (Brazil stinks of Covid), which has more than 400,000 followers, regularly posts videos and pictures of parties in crowded rooms or on boats. Young revellers appear to be challenging the virus that has prevented them from enjoying events such as Rio's Carnival and a summer of sunshine.

On a fairly empty beach in Rio under the April sun, a few young surfers from the Babilonia favela expound on this view: ""We cannot stop living. We are already risking our lives because of stray bullets or raids by the cops, and on top of that we have to stay at home, left to die, without living or enjoying the sea? We know that the virus is there, but we cannot die at home either.""

This is what worries pulmonologist Dalcolmo and her colleagues: Young people tend to take possible symptoms a little too lightly, and end up arriving at the emergency room much too late. Many fear that the number of hospital deaths – already skyrocketing – hides another reality: that more and more Brazilians, for fear of going to the emergency room, are dying at home.

0,Russian suspects in Salisbury poisoning linked to blast in Czech Republic,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/18/europe/czech-republic-russia-salisbury-poisoning-intl/index.html,"(CNN) The suspects of the 2018 novichok nerve agent poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, England, have been linked to a 2014 blast in the Czech Republic that killed two people.

Czech police said Saturday that they were searching for two men in connection with a serious crime. Czech police released images matching those of the Salisbury suspects, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov. UK officials said the men are behind a 2014 explosion at an ammunition depot in Vrbetice.

The Czech police added that the men are known to be carrying various passports, including Russian passports with Petrov and Boshirov's names.

Moscow has denied any involvement with the Salisbury incident, and the men who identified themselves as Petrov and Boshirov claimed they briefly visited the historic cathedral city as tourists. Putin has said the two men identified as suspects are ""not criminals.""

The UK foreign office said on Sunday: ""It has been announced by the Czech authorities that the two GRU Officers that were charged with the attempted murder of the Skripals in Salisbury, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, were also behind the deaths of two civilians and an explosion in the Czech town of Vrbetice.""

Czech police say the men were in the Czech Republic between October 11 and October 16 of 2014, and added they also carried passports from Moldova and Tajikistan, under the names of Nicolai Popa and Ruslan Tabarov respectively.

Shortly before the announcement, the Czech Republic said it would expel 18 employees of the Russian Embassy in Prague in retaliation for the 2014 explosion, which caused huge financial and environmental damage.

""As Foreign Minister I decided to expel all employees of the Russian Embassy who were clearly identified by our security services as officers of Russian Intelligence Services, SVR and GRU,"" Acting Foreign Minister Jan Hamacek said at the time.

Russia will take ""retaliatory measures"" against the Czech Republic over the move, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Sunday.

The decision to expel 18 embassy employees was ""based on unfounded and far-fetched excuses about the involvement of Russian special services in the explosion of 2014 at military depots in Vrbetice settlement,"" the statement said.

""This is even more absurd, since the Czech leadership previously blamed the companies that own these warehouses for explosions,"" it added.

The Russian ministry alleged the move was ""an effort to please the United States against the background of recent US sanctions against Russia, the Czech authorities have even surpassed their overseas masters in this regard.""

Russian intelligence service

Prime Minister Andrej Babiš said Saturday ""there is well founded suspicion that officers of Russian Intelligence Services GRU, unit 29155 were connected to the explosion of a munition depots in Vrbetice in the year 2014.""

He added that the blast ""caused enormous material damage, serious threat and disruption of people's lives, but especially, it killed two of our citizens, two unexpected and innocent fathers.""

Babiš said he informed the European Council President Charles Michel about the investigation into the explosion. The Czech Republic will discuss the explosion with NATO and European Union allies on Monday, according to a tweet sent early Sunday by Hamacek.

Hamacek was scheduled to travel to Moscow in the coming days to discuss the possibility of the Czech Republic acquiring the Russian Covid-19 vaccine. The trip has been canceled because he would be ""needed at the government's meeting on Monday,"" he said.

After that announcement, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Russian state news agency TASS, ""Prague is well aware of what will follow such tricks.""

In a tweet sent Sunday, Deputy Chief of Mission at the US Embassy in Prague Jennifer Bachus said, ""The United States stands with its steadfast Ally, the Czech Republic. We appreciate their significant action to impose costs on Russia for its dangerous actions on Czech soil.""

British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK ""stands in ""stands in full support of our Czech allies, who have exposed the lengths that the Russian intelligence services will go to in their attempts to conduct dangerous and malign operations in Europe.""

He added that it showed "" a pattern of behavior by Moscow, following the Novichok attack in Salisbury.""

NATO said Sunday it supported the Czech Republic as it ""investigates Russia's malign activities on its territory.""

""We express our sympathy to the loved ones of the victims of the explosion in Vrbetice. Those responsible must be brought to justice,"" a NATO official said in a statement.

Relations between London and Moscow deteriorated in 2018 when the UK government pointed the finger of blame at the two Russians it said were the agents of the GRU. The bitter diplomatic fight also saw a wave of tit-for-tat expulsions between Russia and Western nations.

This week the administration of US President Joe Biden targeted Russia with sweeping sanctions and diplomatic expulsions, punishing Moscow for its interference in the 2020 US election, its SolarWinds cyberattack and its ongoing occupation and ""severe human rights abuses"" in Crimea.

0,China to launch a pair of spacecraft towards the edge of the solar system,https://spacenews.com/china-to-launch-a-pair-of-spacecraft-towards-the-edge-of-the-solar-system/,"Chinese Voyager-like missions could launch in 2024, making planetary flybys before focusing on heliosphere science.

HELSINKI — China is developing a mission to send a pair of spacecraft to study the far reaches of the solar system and reach interstellar space by mid-century.

The project aims to send separate spacecraft to the nose and tail of the heliosphere, a region of space dominated by solar wind created by our Sun, to study distinct areas of this bubble and how it interacts with the interstellar medium.

Wu Weiren, a senior figure in China’s lunar exploration project, told official industry newspaper China Space News Friday that scientists are working on an implementation plan for the mission.

Wu says the mission aims to reach 100 astronomical units—one AU is equivalent to one Sun-Earth distance, or 150 million kilometers—from Earth by 2049, when the People’s Republic of China celebrates the centenary of its founding.

No launch date was provided by Wu. However an overview of the proposed mission presented to the European Planetary Science Congress in 2019 indicates the Chinese heliosphere probes would launch in 2024. The first would make a flyby of Jupiter in 2029 before heading to the nose of the heliosphere.

The second probe would make a flyby of Jupiter in 2033 before a flyby of ice giant Neptune in 2038. The spacecraft could also potentially release a small impactor probe shortly before arrival, with the main probe observing the interaction with the Neptunian atmosphere.

The project somewhat echoes NASA’s Voyager missions but the probes’ intermediate targets are constrained by current relative positions of the planets. The Voyagers made use of a rare planetary alignment to visit all four outer planets. Voyager 1 and 2 are now 22.7 and 18.9 billion kilometers (152 and 126 AU) away from Earth respectively.

For the Chinese probes more science focus is therefore on the heliosphere and interstellar medium, including studying phenomena such as Anomalous Cosmic Rays and the “hydrogen wall,” at the boundary of the solar system and interstellar space.

The Chinese heliosphere probes will take advantage of advances in propulsion and ground station and deep space communications made in recent years by China’s space industry. Such progress has recently facilitated missions to Mars, a lunar sample return and a planned mission to Jupiter.

China’s “Interstellar Express”

The mission profile above was understood to still be under development. A workshop hosted by the International Space Science Institute in Beijing in late 2019 explored the mission trade space and presented possibilities including a flyby of Kuiper Belt Object Quaoar and its small moon Weywot. The workshop also used the name “Interstellar Express” for the proposed Chinese mission.

A 2019 paper on “Exploring the solar system boundary” published in Scientia Sinica by Wu and other high profile Chinese scientists in space exploration provides insight into probable launch and spacecraft design.

The spacecraft will be powered by radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) with a science payload mass of greater than 50 kilograms. Long March 3B and larger Long March 5 rockets are under consideration for launch, depending on which propulsion systems—dual-mode chemical propulsion systems or monopropellant and ion-electric propulsion—are selected.

A further mission proposal noted in the paper would head away from the Sun perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic. That mission would launch in 2030 and be powered by a nuclear thermal reactor.

Achieving speeds of around 6 AU per year, the spacecraft could also target extreme Kuiper Belt Objects on its highly inclined trajectory. The technology maturity level for the mission is noted as low, thus requiring breakthroughs and verification.

The two 2024 Chinese missions would become the sixth and seventh spacecraft to achieve solar system escape velocity, following NASA’s Pioneer 10 and 11, Voyagers 1 and 2, and New Horizons.

Pioneer 10 is the only spacecraft to head towards the tail of the heliosphere. Communication with the spacecraft was lost in 2003 at a distance of 12 billion kilometers (80 AU) from Earth.

Scientists at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab are meanwhile studying the Interstellar Probe mission that could launch before 2030.

China recently approved a 14th Five-year plan for the period 2021-2026. Wu noted that missions for a fourth phase of Chinese lunar exploration, including a basic international lunar research station, would be carried out or developed during the period.

Wu added that the 2010 Chang’e-2 lunar orbiter, which later conducted a flyby of asteroid Toutatis, is expected to return to the vicinity of the earth around 2027.",747,4765,14,73

The Ukrainian navy has threatened to shoot at Russian FSB security service patrol ships in a worrying flashpoint amid fears a war could be sparked between the nations.

In the latest of several spats, five Federal Security Service vessels carried out “provocative manoeuvres” in the Azov Sea around three Gyurza-M-class artillery boats of Ukraine’s navy.

“In response to the threats from the Russian vessels, our sailors had to warn of a readiness to use weapons,” said Andrii Klymenko, editor of Black Sea News.

After the Kyiv sailors issued the threat to shoot, they were allowed to proceed, he said.

There are fears Russia is seeking to provoke a response from Ukraine which may act as a catalyst to a wider conflict and even full scale war.

Vladimir Putin is projected to have 115,000 troops in place by early next week.

It comes as Ukraine has warned that it could unilaterally build a nuclear arsenal if NATO refuses to permit it membership of the Western military alliance.

It was formerly a nuclear state with 176 ICBMs and 44 strategic bombers after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and agreed to eliminate its weaponry in return for legally-binding security guarantees from Britain, the US and Russia.

“We must do everything possible to ensure that Putin will not attack us tomorrow or the day after tomorrow,” said Andriy Melnik, Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany.

“The only possibility for this is for Ukraine to finally become a NATO member.

“If Ukraine were a NATO member in 2014... it would never have come to the annexation and this terrible war in the east,” he said.

He warned bluntly: ”Ukraine has no other choice, either we are part of an alliance such as NATO and are doing our part to make this Europe stronger, or we have the only option: to arm by ourselves, and maybe think about nuclear status again.

“How else can we guarantee our defence?”

In a plea for the West to bolster its security guarantees, he said: “Almost 90,000 [Russian] servicemen, as well as their armed systems were pulled to the border and to the region of occupied Crimea and Donbas.

“This deployment is not just muscle flexing.

“We are dealing with the largest troop movement in Russia since the Second World War.”

Russian state-owned Sputnik news agency said in a report that Ukraine “likely retains the technical capability to build a nuclear arsenal”.

But it said: “The state of its civilian nuclear power programme leaves something to be desired.

“Last year, Ukrainian nuclear industry workers sounded the alarm about the threat of ‘another Chernobyl’ citing a ‘dire situation’ which they said was ‘taking shape in the country's nuclear energy sector’ due to a lack of oversight, safety permits, and funds.”

Kyiv warned strongly over the threat of the Azov Sea tension escalating into a major incident.

""Russia continues to violate international law,” said the Ukrainian navy.

""Russia's FSB made yet another attempt to hinder the lawful actions of a Ukrainian Navy boat group on combat duty.

“The Ukrainian navy's tactical boat group proceeded with its mission despite Russian provocations and deliberate efforts to restrict free navigation.”

On Thursday, Ukraine issued a protest over Russia's decision to bar foreign warships and state vessels from parts of the Black Sea in the direction of the Kerch Strait from next week until October.

Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry said: ""Such actions by the Russian Federation are another attempt, in violation of the norms and principles of international law, at usurping [our] sovereign rights as a littoral state.

“It is Ukraine that has the right to regulate navigation in these parts of the Black Sea.”

There were claims that satellite images show Russia has installed in Crimea S-400 anti-aircraft systems with a range of 250 miles, according to Information Navigator.

This allows “the Russian occupation forces to control almost all the airspace of the Black Sea”.

It is an everyday morning routine for young brothers - who we're calling Aung Lin and Kyaw Lin - to look towards the mountain and remember their friends and family after they were smuggled out a fortnight ago.

“Mummy, we really miss you and our friends and want you to come back now,” said younger brother Aung Lin, 13, on the phone to her mother in Myanmar.

“The situation is very volatile in our town and the army is continually raiding houses. So don’t think of even coming soon,” said the weeping mother on the other side of the phone.

Both brothers were studying in the local school of a small Myanmar town and were living with a family of six after the death of their father.

After their father died, their mother began working hard in their fields to ensure a proper education for her sons.

But it all changed with the military coup in Myanmar.

After the coup, the Junta started facing massive civilian protests all across the country and at many places policemen revolted and ran away to India, leaving behind their jobs and families.

Most of these policemen were not willing to shoot the pro-democracy supporters and have joined a civil disobedience movement called by ousted leader Aung Sang Suu Kyi.

Faced with its depleting ranks in armed forces, the Myanmar army started recruiting young children.

“They began searching for young boys in the day time and they would come in the night to pick them up for forcible recruitment in the army,” said older brother Kyaw Lin, 15.

“They searched for us as well. So me and my friends ran away from there and have taken shelter in India.”

Many families are hiding on the Indian side to avoid the daily violence and the army’s brutality in Myanmar.

One refugee from Myanmar, currently staying in India, told ITV News that children are running away from the country because the army is using its muscle power to recruit them. So boys aged 12-15 are running away from their homes and hiding in other countries and in jungles.

ITV News met scores of young children who are currently staying in India to avoid being forced into joining the Army.

“My parents are worried for us and didn’t want us to work in the army so they shifted us to India. Most of my friends have also shifted to India. We can’t go back to Myanmar, the situation is very bad so we are still hiding in India,” said the 18-year-old who didn’t want to named.

Myanmar is thought to have up to 50,000 children serving for its armed forces, one of the largest numbers of underage soldiers in the world.

The opposition organised anti-Kremlin rallies across the country in response, sparking a violent crackdown from police and thousands of detentions, before deciding to pause the street protest movement.

“Right now he is being killed in a prison colony. We can’t wait any longer,” Navalny ally Leonid Volkov said as he announced further demonstrations in all major Russian cities for Wednesday evening, shortly after President Vladimir Putin gives his annual state of the nation address.

More than 450,000 people have already registered to take part in the events. While the number is shy of a previously announced target of half a million, the figure suggests that Wednesday could see the country’s biggest protests since the collapse of the Soviet Union three decades ago.

“Have you seen a person being killed with your own eyes? You have. You are seeing it now,” Mr Volkov said in a video released via the opposition leader’s YouTube channel on Sunday.

“No matter how much you want to escape that thought, to change the topic - that does not change the fact that Alexei Navalny is being killed. Using terrible means. In front of all of us.”

Doctors said that the levels of potassium in Mr Navalny’s blood were significantly higher than the level that usually requires medical intervention. “This means both impaired renal function and that serious heart problems can develop at any minute,” his personal doctor Anastasia Vasilyeva said in a statement.

Mr Navalny has tried to keep an upbeat tone in messages passed to his lawyers and posted on social media, in which he has joked about his routine in prison.

But he has also told of how prison guards wake him once an hour throughout the night, and of threats to put him in a straight-jacket and force-feed him if he does not end his hunger strike.

The EU said it would discuss Mr Navalny’s case at a meeting of foreign ministers on Monday, as French President Emmanuel Macron said it was time to draw “clear red lines” in relation to Russia, a shift away from his usual conciliatory tone.

The EU said it was ""deeply concerned"" about Mr Navalny's failing health, while a senior Biden administration official warned that Russia would face repercussions if he died.

""We have communicated to the Russian government that what happens to Mr Navalny in their custody is their responsibility and they will be held accountable by the international community,"" Jake Sullivan, Joe Biden's national security adviser, said on CNN's State of the Union.

Both the EU and the US have sanctioned Moscow over its treatment of the opposition leader.

Mr Navalny has long accused the Kremlin of orchestrating his poisoning, and last year appeared to trick an FSB agent into admitting details of the attempted killing during a sting call.

Since his jailing, authorities have kept up pressure on the opposition movement, raiding his offices and placing a number of Mr Navalny’s key allies under house arrest. Last week, prosecutors moved to label his organisation an “extremist group”, meaning supporters could face lengthy jail terms.",553,3322,11,73

REUTERS/Diego Vara

Brazil asked women on Friday to delay getting pregnant until the worst of the pandemic passes, saying the virus variant that is devastating the South American country appears to affect expectant mothers more than earlier versions of the coronavirus.

The recommendation comes as Brazil continues to be one of the global epicenters of the pandemic, with more Brazilians dying of the virus each day than anywhere else in the world.

Hospitals are buckling under the strain and stocks of drugs needed for intubating severely ill patients are running perilously low, with Brazil turning to international partners for help with emergency supplies.

""If it’s possible, delay pregnancy a little until a better moment,"" Health Ministry official Raphael Parente said during a news conference on Friday.

He said the recommendation was partly due to the stress on the health system but also due to the more easily transmissible Brazilian variant known as P.1.

""The clinical experience of specialists shows that this new variant acts more aggressively in pregnant women,"" Parente said.

Previously, COVID-19 cases during pregnancy were focused on the final trimester and birth, whereas lately there have been more serious cases in the second and occasionally first trimester, he said.

Parente did not give any more details.

The P.1 variant, first discovered in the Amazon city of Manaus, has quickly become dominant in Brazil. It is thought to be a major factor behind a massive second wave of infections that has brought the country's death toll to over 350,000 - the second highest in the world behind the United States.

Brazil's outbreak is increasingly affecting younger people, with hospital data showing that in March more than half of all patients in intensive care were aged 40 or younger. read more

President Jair Bolsonaro has opposed lockdowns and held large events in which he often does not wear a mask. He has only recently embraced vaccines as a possible solution, but the inoculation rollout has been plagued by delays and missed targets for getting people inoculated.

This week, vaccinations were stopped in several cities due to a shortage of vaccine supply, according to local media.

The surge in COID-19 cases has also left hospitals short of sedatives needed for patients who require mechanical ventilation.

An emergency shipment of the drugs arrived in Brazil late on Thursday from China, while donations from Spain are expected to arrive next week.

Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo have both sounded the alarm over shortages, with Sao Paulo's health secretary saying this week that the city's ability to care for seriously ill COVID-19 patients is on the verge of collapse.

Despite the shortage of drugs and 85% of intensive care beds occupied, Sao Paulo announced on Friday it would begin reopening stores and restaurants, saying the number of new hospitalizations had fallen sufficiently to do so safely.

Three aftershocks of a magnitude 4 followed the initial quake, the report said.

The US Geological Survey called the initial temblor a 5.8 magnitude earthquake. It said its depth was 10 kilometers (6.2 miles).

A magnitude 5 earthquake can cause considerable damage. Such shallow earthquakes as Sunday’s also can result in broader damage.

The quake was some 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Iran’s Bushehr nuclear power plant. There was no immediate report on the plant, though the facility was constructed to withstand earthquakes up to magnitude 8.

Iran is on major seismic faults and experiences one earthquake a day on average. In 2003, a magnitude 6.6 earthquake flattened the historic city of Bam, killing 26,000 people.

A magnitude 7 earthquake that struck western Iran in 2017 killed more than 600 people and injured more than 9,000.",297,1883,11,73

The United States has cancelled the deployment of two warships to the Black Sea, Turkish diplomatic sources said on Wednesday, amid concerns over a Russian military build-up on Ukraine's borders.

Washington and NATO have been alarmed by the build-up near Ukraine and in Crimea, the peninsula that Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Last week, Turkey said Washington would send two warships to the Black Sea, in a decision Russia called an unfriendly provocation. read more

The U.S. Embassy in Ankara had notified Turkey's foreign ministry of the move, the sources said, but did not provide a reason. Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency later reported that no new notices had been conveyed to Ankara for potential deployments at later dates.

U.S. officials said that Turkey may have misunderstood the initial notification and the deployment was never confirmed.

They said the United States frequently notifies Turkey for potential access to the Black Sea. But a request does not necessarily mean its ships will pass through, but rather ensures that if they choose to, they already have the required approval.

Russia, which warned Washington to stay far away from Crimea and its Black Sea coast, says the build-up is a three-week snap military drill to test combat readiness in response to what it calls threatening behaviour from NATO. It has said the exercise is due to wrap up within two weeks. read more

Ahead of the notification about U.S. warships, Russia's navy on Wednesday began a drill in the Black Sea that rehearsed firing at surface and air targets. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called on Moscow on Tuesday to end its troop build-up.

Lawmakers are mulling plans to gradually increase the legal age at which people can buy tobacco products as New Zealand aims to become smoke-free by 2025.

In a consultation document, the government said: “A smoke-free generation policy would prohibit the sale, and the supply in a public place, of smoked tobacco products to new cohorts from a specified date.

“For example, if legislation commenced on 1 January 2022, then people younger than 18 years at that time or those born after 1 January 2004 would never be able to lawfully be sold smoked tobacco products.”

Associate health minister Dr Ayesha Verrall said a “new approach” to smoking was needed as she warned that “business as usual ... won't get us there”.

The government is also considering a ban on filters, reducing the amount of nicotine in tobacco products and limiting the number of places where they can be bought.

Ministers are also considering setting a minimum price for tobacco products.

New Zealand's Cancer Society welcomed the proposals, saying they would help to reduce inequalities.

It said six shops on average were selling tobacco within a 10-minute walk of New Zealand secondary schools, and that there were four times more tobacco retailers in low-income communities where smoking rates are highest.

“This proposal goes beyond assisting people to quit. The government is demonstrating a commitment to preventing young people from starting to smoke and bring smoking rates down,” its chief executive, Lucy Elwood, said.

“These glaring inequities are why we need to protect future generations from the harms of tobacco,” said Ms Elwood. “Tobacco is the most harmful consumer product in history and needs to be phased out.”

New Zealand's right-wing ACT party criticised the proposals, saying they would disproportionately affect poor people.

“New Zealand smokers who can least afford it will spend more on their habit and in turn do harm to those around them if the government mandates lower nicotine,” the ACT's social development and children spokesperson, Karen Chhour, said in a statement.

Shane Kawenata Bradbrook, an advocate for cutting smoking among the Maori people, said the changes would benefit his community, and that the plan “will begin the final demise of tobacco products in this country”.

Smoking rates are highest among Māori and Pasifika New Zealanders, Mr Bradbrook said.

“For too long the tobacco industry has been addicting our people, fleecing them of their money before we have to bury them in urupa [burial grounds] all over this land,” he added.

“I am looking forward to truly making this a sunset industry in this corner of the world.”

According to the Cancer Society, tobacco smoking is a leading cause of preventable death for the Maori in New Zealand.",550,3489,12,74
0,Piers Morgan to US on frequent mass shootings: ‘Just admit you don’t care’,https://www.foxnews.com/media/piers-morgan-to-us-on-frequent-mass-shootings-just-admit-you-dont-care,"British commentator Piers Morgan called ""hypocrisy"" on Friday after the latest U.S. mass shooting took place at a FedEx facility in Indiana.

Morgan’s target: The American public.

""I wish Americans would stop pretending to be ‘shocked’ by the country’s unrelenting procession of mass shootings,"" Morgan wrote on Twitter.

""You can’t be ‘shocked’ when something keeps happening that you do nothing to stop,"" he continued. ""Just admit you don’t care enough to act, because you love guns too much.""

Just hours before Morgan commented, a gunman later identified by authorities as Brandon Hole, 19, arrived at the FedEx facility in Indianapolis and allegedly killed eight people and wounded others. Hole later died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, authorities said.

The mass shooting followed others that have occurred recently in South Carolina, California, Colorado, Maryland and Georgia.

But some social media users pushed back against Morgan’s statements.

""We love freedom too much,"" one respondent wrote. ""That’s the word you were looking for.""

""No, it’s more like gun control isn’t going to fix the problem of sin and evil in the world,"" another wrote. ""We need to go back to the family and values.""

""Maybe we should look at addressing the disturbed people who carry out these heinous acts and not the tools they use,"" another wrote.

Earlier this month, President Biden declared gun violence in the U.S. to be a ""public health crisis"" and announced a set of gun control proposals he hoped to push through Congress. The proposed measures include bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.

Sensing pushback from supporters of Second Amendment gun rights, Biden insisted his plan would not infringe on personal freedoms.

""Nothing I’m about to recommend in any way impinges on the Second Amendment,"" Biden insisted on April 8. ""These are phony arguments suggesting that these are Second Amendment rights at stake from what we’re talking about.""

Biden doubled down Friday, calling on the Senate to approve gun legislation that the House passed in March, referring to frequent mass shootings as a ""national embarrassment.""

Many Republicans are resisting Biden’s plan, however, with some referring to it as a ""gun grab.""

Biden’s GOP critics have included attorneys general from Arkansas, West Virginia and Montana.

""I will not allow the far left to run roughshod over our citizens’ gun rights,"" West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey wrote April 9. ""If President Biden follows through on his proposals, we will be in court very quickly.""

Vladimir Putin may have ordered up to half a million troops to the Ukrainian border as fears of war in Europe rise.

A veteran analyst today warned that the country is on the ""doorstep of war"" thanks to ""total mobilisation"" on a level not seen for nearly 50 years, at the height of the Cold War.

Russia is ready to go to war with the US if it intervenes, it is claimed - in spite of Joe Biden's call for calm.

Today Russian navy began drills in the Black Sea in a show of strength ahead of the arrival of two US warships in the region.

Videos released today seem to show heavy armaments on the move in Krasnodar region and naval vessels on the Don River.

Russia is known to be switching landing ships and other crafts from the Caspian Sea to the Black Sea for the first time since the end of the Soviet era.

Chilling new footage today also showed Russia’s Black Sea Fleet on manoeuvres - while Ukraine also conducted naval exercises off Crimea.

Yesterday Joe Biden called for a summit with Putin in a neutral country - but Russia has vowed decisive action if new Western sanctions follow.

This comes as a veteran independent Russian defence analyst Pavel Felgenhauer has claimed Putin may have ordered the movement of “more than half a million” troops involving forces from the Pacific to the Baltic.

Asked on Ekho Moscow radio if Russia was “on the doorstep of war”, he replied: “Practically, we are.”

He said: “An unprecedented mobilisation of the Russian armed forces is taking place.

“All the armed forces. This has not happened either since 1973, or since 1962. Total mobilisation. All armed forces .

“The exact number of people participating is not officially indicated. Apparently more than half a million.”

He stressed that the movements of troops take place during the day in order to show that Russia is ""fully mobilised"" and ""in full combat readiness"".

He said: “Because if we start something with Ukraine, the Americans said that they would support it, then we are ready to go to war with America at any moment.”

He claimed Russian was “preparing a deep operation for the total defeat of the Ukrainian Armed Forces by means of a strike, containment at the Donbass front itself and a powerful blow through Kharkiv from Voronezh, Bryansk, and Belgorod, cutting off and encircling the Ukrainian grouping in Donbass.

“And a counter strike from the Crimea. Plus a landing to ‘free’ Mykolaiv and Odessa from Ukraine.”

He stressed: “This does not mean that it will necessarily begin. But the preparation is serious.”

Such an attack would be possible between now and September, he forecast.

""In order for the West not to interfere and leave it to Ukraine to be devoured, we must show that we are ready for an all-out war.”

Felgenhauer alleged: ""Putin says that Russians and Ukrainians are one people, and should live in one state. Ein volk, ein Reich.

“And that the Ukrainian nation-state and the Ukrainian nation is a disgusting chimera invented by the Austro-Hungarians.”

(Image: REUTERS)

The current troop movements show “a fundamental difference from the routine of recent years”, he told independent Novaya Gazeta newspaper.

“The Russian defence ministry had begun an unprecedented general mobilisation throughout the country from Chukotka (close to Alaska) to Kaliningrad (between Poland and Lithuania) and the advance of troops to the borders of Ukraine under the pretext of a ‘combat readiness check’.”

Felgenhauer - who has worked as a defence analyst and expert for the Russian media for three decades - said: “All this looks as if the Russian General Staff is gathering forces and means for a possible ‘deep' strategic operation.

“A powerful tank wedge of the right flank, striking to the southwest through Kharkiv, cuts through weak Ukrainian defences, breaking through places where no-one has fought with anyone since 1943.

“Somewhere on the Left Bank, in the lower reaches of the Dnieper River, the oncoming southern wedge from the Crimea joins the northern one.

“ Powerful airborne assault forces bring an additional element of chaos to the Ukrainian command and control system.

“The main Russian-speaking cities of south and east (Ukraine) will be occupied in the course of a victorious and fleeting blitzkrieg.

“The rest of Ukraine will be denied access to the sea.

“As it was recently announced, the end of Ukraine as a state will come.""

Ukraine gained its independence in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union, but the two nations have had a hostile relationship for three decades.

Russia has been regularly accused of colluding with Ukrainian separatists in the east, and Ukrainian officials have frequently claimed Moscow is intent on splitting the country in half.

Large swathes of the Donbas conflict region in eastern Ukraine has a large population of Russian speakers, with a large proportion holding Russian passports.

Putin has vocally pledged to protect Russian citizens in other countries, offer a possible pretext to incursions into Ukraine.

In 2014 Russia annexed Crimea, a move that drew international condemnation and further demonstrated Putin's intention to expand his borders into former Soviet countries.

An estimated 14,000 people have died in the conflict

Russia said its naval exercises involved “a detachment of ships of the Black Sea Fleet"" conducting artillery firing as part of a combat readiness check.

This included frigate Admiral Makarov, small missile ships Graivoron and Vyshny Volochek, air-cushion missile ship Samum, minesweeper Ivan Golubets, as well as large landing ships.",984,6019,14,74

As survivors of the Titanic sinking floated in the freezing waters of the northern Atlantic Ocean, glowing lights spread across the sky.

Some called them ""greenish beams"". Others called them hallucinations. But no doubt, they were real.

It was a beautiful night. Dark, but full of starlight in the early hours of April 15, 1912. The weather was calm, the sea smooth. The conditions extraordinary: bitterly cold. Perfectly still. By this stage, the deathly screams had faded from the air.

The bright lights, according to some of the 706 survivors left, had appeared earlier in the night, when passengers were being loaded into lifeboats as the Titanic swiftly sank to her watery grave.

Some watched from the deck of the ship, others watched from the safety of lifeboats already at sea.

""They seemed so near, and their light so much more intense than ever before, that fancy suggested they saw this beautiful ship in dire distress below and all their energies had awakened to flash messages across the black dome of the sky to each other; telling and warning of the calamity happening in the world beneath,"" wrote survivor Lawrence Beesley.

""The stars seemed really to be alive and to talk.""

Little did he know at the time that while the beauty of the light show distracted some from the horrors unfolding before them and eventually helped rescuers spot people in the water, it could have been a huge part of the problem.

More than 100 years later, new research suggests it was those very lights — the northern lights – that helped bring the Titanic to her untimely demise.

The research, conducted by weather expert Mila Zinkova, suggests a geomagnetic storm taking place that night would have played havoc with the ship's navigational system in the run-up to the disaster, hindering subsequent rescue efforts and adding more confusion to the scene as it unfolded.

The research was published in the journal Weather late last year.

""The significant space weather event was in the form of a moderate to strong geomagnetic storm that observational evidence suggests was in effect in the North Atlantic at the time of the tragedy,"" Zinkova says.

She suggests that while the light show was playing in the sky above, it was also changing the Titanic's compass – a marvel not yet uncovered by science.

The slightest change of even 0.5 degrees would have been cataclysmic for the ship and put it on its fatal collision course.

""This apparently insignificant error could have made the difference between colliding with the iceberg and avoiding it,"" she writes.

Ship steered off course

Zinkova suggests the ""unsinkable"" ship was being steered off course by auroras formed by a solar storm.

According to Nasa, the sun ""burps"" high-speed streams of electrifying gas to Earth, sometimes so large it causes a ""mass ejection"". The electrified gas collides with our atmosphere and interacts with atmospheric gases, resulting in beautiful displays of light in the sky.

But it comes with a catch. Ejections like this can also interrupt electrical and magnetic signals.

""When solar storms occur, it could affect compasses and radio communications,"" Zinkova told news.com.au.

At the time of the sinking, Zinkova said, experts did not know about the kinds of communication problems that such events could produce.

But, she said, ""even a very small compass error could have taken [the Titanic] off course"".

An unexplained problem

As rescue ship RMS Carpathia steamed towards the Titanic in the early hours of April 15, second officer James Bisset looked toward the sky and noticed there was no moon. They were about 100km from the site of the disaster.

""But the Aurora Borealis glimmered like moonbeams shooting up from the northern horizon,"" he wrote in his 1959 memoir, Tramps and Ladies: My Early Years in Steamers.

""The air was intensely cold. Though visibility was good, the peculiar atmospheric conditions … made the sea and sky seem to blend into one another, so that it was difficult to define the horizon.""

He watched his boss, Captain Arthur Rostron, standing silently, gazing ahead, and to the sky, watching the play of light from the Aurora Borealis.

""He raised his cap a few inches from his forehead, and uttered a silent prayer, moving his lips soundlessly,"" Bisset said.

The Titanic sank about 2.20am. Survivors' accounts vary of the timing of the lights; there are suggestions they were seen as early as before midnight to when the passengers were picked up towards dawn the next day by the Carpathia.

RMS Carpathia.

""Though the night was cloudless, and stars were shining, the peculiar atmospheric conditions of visibility intensified as we approached the icefield with the greenish beams of the Aurora Borealis shimmering and confusing the horizon ahead of us,"" Bisset wrote.

""My face was smarting in the frosty air as I stood on the wing of the bridge, keeping a lookout for icebergs.""

Survivors reportedly spotted the lights again at around 3am. When Bisset and the crew of the Carpathia approached the wreckage site, he noted the ""greenish beams"" of light surrounding the lifeboats.

Captain Rostron drove the Carpathia full speed into the dark icefield in which the Titanic had met with disaster.

Zinkova suggests the weather event could also have had something to do with inadvertently leading the Carpathia to the crash site.

She explained the Carpathia had been sent the wrong coordinates by the Titanic's crew at the time – 11km away.

""Every ship that was involved [in the disaster], including the Titanic, Californian [a ship nearby the Titanic that failed to heed its distress signal], Carpathia … they all had some unexplained problem with their position.

""The Carpathia was given the wrong position but somehow she navigated directly to the Titanic.""

It was 11.40pm on April 14, 1912, when the Titanic hit an iceberg during her maiden voyage across the Atlantic Ocean, sealing her fate. She sank to her watery grave the following morning, at 2.20am, killing 1526 passengers. This week marks the disaster's 109th anniversary.

""I know that of course the northern lights could not account for every thing that went wrong, but if the Titanic's compass was affected by the northern lights, maybe Titanic would not have collided with this particular iceberg,"" Zinkova said.",1153,7015,11,74

The government has relaxed the rule on mask-wearing outdoors in response to its successful mass vaccination drive, which has now seen 5.34 million people receive their first shot.

All in all, 61.7 per cent of Israel's 9.3 million citizens have now had a first dose of the vaccine, and 57.4 per cent are fully inoculated.

Newly-recorded COVID-19 cases and deaths in Israel continue to plummet, with just 14 new infections and no deaths recorded on April 17.

The country has also fully reopened all schools and universities. On Saturday, some Israelis spoke to the media about the ""strange"" but welcome experience of being able to ditch their masks in public.

""Keeping people safe is also a form of freedom,"" said Eliana Gamulka, a shopper in Jaffa Street, Jerusalem. ""But it's nice not to have something on your face anymore.

""I'm getting married in two weeks and it's very nice to be able to celebrate with everyone. Without a mask, the pictures will be great.""

Following a string of undercover exposés into how CNN injects bias into narratives, Twitter has suspended Project Veritas’s founder, James O’Keefe.

Project Veritas has, for several years, been releasing exclusive undercover video footage that exposes the biases of TV networks, the media, and Big Tech.

The Project Veritas account had already been suspended by Twitter earlier this year for a video confronting Facebook’s Vice President of Integrity about political bias the platform had been partaking in. Twitter said the confrontation video showed “private information.”

The censorship of Veritas was brought up in congressional hearings about Big Tech’s legal liabilities and shields in March.

While Project Veritas had already been banned, the account of O’Keefe was still available on the platform – until today, the same day an explosive exposé on CNN continued to trend on Twitter.

The undercover CNN videos covered CNN refusing to report on information that went counter to the narrative it wanted to convey, as well as the way in which CNN had amped up the coronavirus fears to increase viewership and engagement.

“Look what we did, we [CNN] got Trump out. I am 100 percent going to say it, and I 100 percent believe that if it wasn’t for CNN, I don’t know that Trump would have got voted out…I came to CNN because I wanted to be a part of that,” CNN’s Technical Director Charlie Chester was caught saying in the trending video.

O’Keefe told Fox News, “It’s probably the biggest story by implication. What it represents – this guy, a director at CNN…he’s admitting the network is propaganda. He says they were trying to get Trump out without admitting that’s what they were doing and saw me confront him about that. I just want them to be honest, he’s not being honest.”

In a statement about the sudden ban, a Twitter spokesperson said O’Keefe had been banned due to their “platform manipulation and spam” policy. “…you can’t mislead others on Twitter by operating fake accounts,” and “you can’t artificially amplify or disrupt conversations through the use of multiple accounts.”

It’s unclear what Twitter is referring to.

Twitter sent O’Keefe a similar message:

On Telegram, O’Keefe said he was suing Twitter. “I am suing Twitter for defamation because they said I, James O’Keefe, ‘operated fake accounts.’ This is false, this is defamatory, and they will pay,” he said.

Project Veritas has a long history with Twitter. In the past, Veritas leaked undercover information about a Twitter’s engineer’s bias from inside the company, as well as an internal conference call of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.

0,Pakistan PM: Insulting Islam’s Prophet Should Be Same as Denying Holocaust,https://www.voanews.com/south-central-asia/pakistan-pm-insulting-islams-prophet-should-be-same-denying-holocaust,"ISLAMABAD - Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan is urging Western governments to criminalize any insulting remarks against Islam’s Prophet Muhammad and treat offenders the same way they do those who deny the Holocaust.

Khan spoke Saturday after violent nationwide protests this week by a radical Islamist party demanding expulsion of the French ambassador over the publication of cartoons in France depicting the prophet, an act condemned as blasphemous.

Khan tweeted: “Those in the West, incl extreme right politicians, who deliberately indulge in such abuse & hate under guise of freedom of speech clearly lack moral sense & courage to apologize to the 1.3 bn Muslims for causing this hurt.”

He also called on Western governments that have outlawed negative comments about the Holocaust ""to use the same standards to penalize those deliberately spreading their message of hate against Muslims by abusing our Prophet.”

I also call on Western govts who have outlawed any negative comment on the holocaust to use the same standards to penalise those deliberately spreading their message of hate against Muslims by abusing our Prophet PBUH. — Imran Khan (@ImranKhanPTI) April 17, 2021

Many European countries have laws that criminalize the Holocaust denial, an act of negating the Nazi genocide of European Jews, and offenders can end up in jail.

Activists of the radical Islamist party Tehreek-i-Labaik Pakistan protested in the streets Monday shortly after Pakistani authorities arrested their leader, Saad Rizvi.

Officials defended the arrest, saying Rizvi was planning to march on Islamabad, with thousands of supporters set to besiege the capital to pressure the government to expel the French ambassador.

Thousands of angry protesters blocked key highways, causing traffic jams, paralyzing business and routine life for three days in Pakistan. Police attempts to disperse the protesters sparked violent clashes that killed four law enforcers and injured more than 600 others.

The demonstrations were eventually dispersed, but the unprecedented direct attacks on police provoked the government Thursday to outlaw TLP for indulging in terrorist attacks against the state.

Khan on Saturday defended the ban on TLP and vehemently dismissed suggestions the move had stemmed from international pressure on Pakistan.

“Let me make clear to people here & abroad: Our govt only took action against TLP under our anti-terrorist law when they challenged the writ of the state and used street violence & attacking the public & law enforcers,” the prime minister wrote on Twitter. “No one can be above the law and the Constitution.”

TLP leaders have recently organized several major street protests, disrupting routine life and business in the country.

Along with demonstrations against France, the extremist group has pressured the Pakistani government into not repealing or reforming the country’s harsh blasphemy laws, which critics say often are used to intimidate religious minorities and settle personal disputes.

French urged to leave

On Thursday, France advised citizens and companies to temporarily leave Pakistan, citing “serious threats to French interests” in the South Asian nation.

Most of the French nationals are said to have ignored the advisory, however, and have chosen to stay in Pakistan, the AFP news agency reported Saturday.

Pakistani officials insisted there were no safety concerns for foreign nationals in the country.

“We are aware of the advice, which appears to be based on their own assessment of the situation,” Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Zahid Hafeez Chaudhri said. “For its part, the government is taking enhanced measures for the maintenance of law and order and preventing any damage to life and property.""",608,3951,11,74

An aide to the former Archbishop of Canterbury faces questions from the charity watchdog over allegations that proceeds from the sale of a £300,000 church property “disappeared”. The Charity Commission is assessing allegations that two leading bishops “beguiled” elderly congregants to sign over their status as trustees of church properties for “precisely nothing”. It is claimed that proceeds from the sale of property meant for the benefit of local congregations have allegedly “disappeared without an audit trail”. The commission is examining complaints from trustees over possible irregularities in charity accounts overseen by the Bishop Primus and Bishop of the Northern Diocese, the Rt Rev Dr John Fenwick – a former adviser to Lord Carey, the previous Archbishop of Canterbury – and the Bishop of the Southern Diocese, the Rt Rev Paul Hunt. West Midlands Police said it was reviewing an allegation of fraud to establish if any offences may have been committed. Bishop Fenwick leads the Free Church of England, a splinter group from the Church of England that was forged in the mid 19th century. He is supported in his role by Bishop Hunt. It is alleged that Bishop Fenwick assured congregants that £300,000 from the sale of St Stephen’s Church in Middlesbrough was being held in the FCE Central Trust. However, the complainants say the company’s records do not show any record of the money being deposited. The commission has received allegations that the transfer of property from congregants to the trust has happened because “frail, elderly” trustees are “being persuaded that it will relieve them of the stresses of trusteeship and safeguard the future of the property”. The watchdog is also assessing claims that the trust was registering local churches’ land and buildings in its name without ever paying for them, nor reflecting their value in the accounts. “Perhaps [this is] because Bishop Fenwick has been persuading befuddled, elderly and weary local church trustees to sign over their properties to Central Trust for precisely nothing,” one complainant alleged. The commission is also assessing an allegation that around £30,000 “disappeared without an audit trail” from the bank account of Emmanuel Free Church of England, Morecambe, in 2017. The FCE Central Trust responded on behalf of both bishops, saying it “vigorously refutes the allegations”. “If they are indeed the subject of Charity Commission and police investigations (though the Trust has been contacted by neither) then it would be inappropriate to comment further,” it said. Bishop Fenwick said St Stephen’s Church was sold after consultation with the congregation because it was “found to be in a dangerous state of repair”. He said a portion of the proceeds of the sale were used to hire a minister – for £24,000 per year, plus accommodation costs and expenses – in the hope of “reviving the congregation” in April 2018. After two years, “there had been no significant growth in the size of the congregation”, and the minister was made redundant in February 2021.",493,3067,10,74
0,Liberal MP apologizes after appearing naked on House of Commons video feed,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/william-amos-liberal-mp-naked-parliament-1.5988128,"A Quebec Liberal MP is apologizing after he was seen naked on a video screen while MPs participated in a hybrid parliamentary session on Wednesday.

William Amos, who represents the western Quebec riding of Pontiac, appeared on-screen without clothes moving around his office. Amos appeared on a video feed that only MPs and House of Commons staff can see, separate from the public-facing ParlVu video system.

CBC News obtained a photo that shows Amos standing without clothes in what appears to be an office with Canadian and Quebec flags in the background. He is holding something that blocks the view of his private parts.

In a statement, Amos said the incident was the result of an unfortunate error.

""My video was accidentally turned on as I was changing into my work clothes after going for a jog. I sincerely apologize to my colleagues in the House of Commons for this unintentional distraction. Obviously, it was an honest mistake and it won't happen again,"" Amos said.

Bloc Québécois MP Claude DeBellefeuille raised the issue in a point of order with the Speaker of the House of Commons following question period.

""Mr. Speaker, as you know, since the beginning of the pandemic we have tried to emphasize the importance of respecting decorum and the dress code here in the House. I think that today we have set a new record. We have seen a member during question period improperly dressed. That is, unclothed. So perhaps remind the members, especially the male members, that suits and ties are appropriate but also a shirt, underpants and pants,"" DeBellefeuille said in French.

""We have seen that the member was in very good shape, but I think this member should be reminded of what is appropriate and to control his camera.""

Liberal MP apologizes after caught on camera naked during question period The National 1:37 A Liberal MP has apologized after being caught completely naked on camera during a virtual question period in the House of Commons. 1:37

Speaker of the House Anthony Rota replied in French that while he didn't catch a glimpse himself, House technicians did see ""something.""

""I would therefore like to remind members to always be vigilant when they are near a camera and a microphone,"" Rota said.

Parliament has been operating in a hybrid form since May of last year because the physical-distancing measures imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic forced a reduction in the number of politicians and staff working in person in the Commons. Most MPs have been participating in proceedings virtually via Zoom since then, and only a small number have been attending in person.

According to House of Commons Procedure and Practice, there is no specific dress code required in the House. But Speakers have ruled that to be recognized to speak, all MPs must be dressed in contemporary business attire. For men, that means wearing a suit jacket, shirt and tie as standard dress, the guide says.",506,3014,12,74
0,US company illegally peddling ‘miracle cure’ bleach for new Covid variants,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/15/us-company-florida-oclo-bleach-covid-variants,"Peddlers of industrial bleach who urge Americans to drink the fluid as a “miracle cure” for cancer, HIV/Aids and other diseases have begun touting the product illegally as a treatment for the latest variants of Covid-19.

Chlorine dioxide, a powerful bleaching agent used in textile and paper manufacturing, is being compounded and sold out of a makeshift laboratory in Miami, Florida. The company, Oclo Nanotechnology Science, is playing on fears of the new strain of the coronavirus discovered in the UK, which is now spreading rapidly and widely through the US.

The UK variant, B117, is thought to be more transmissible and deadly than the initial form of the virus.

The Miami company is invoking B117 to drive up sales of its bleach products, which the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns are potentially dangerous and can be life-threatening. The front page of Oclo’s website is dominated by a photograph of vials of its chlorine dioxide product billed as an “antiviral” treatment.

The image is superimposed with the words: “B117 … new variant of coronavirus, the most contagious and dangerous in the United States. Rescuing chlorine dioxide and its great curative potential against pathogens.”

The appearance of a new marketing push out of Miami by peddlers of the bleach “cure”, often referred to as “miracle mineral solution”, or MMS, signals the FDA’s uphill struggle in trying to control the potentially lethal trade. Since the start of the pandemic, the federal agency has been clamping down on fraudulent products which claim to treat or cure Covid-19.

It has also been using its enforcement muscle to move against chlorine dioxide dealers. Last August, the FDA arrested Mark Grenon and his four sons, who were among the most prominent “miracle” bleach peddlers in the US.

Members of the Grenon family claimed to be “bishops” of the Florida-based Genesis II “church” that sold bleach under the guise that it was a “sacrament”. They remain in jails in Miami and Colombia awaiting extradition to the US facing charges of conspiracy to defraud the US and to introduce a misbranded drug into interstate commerce.

Having taken down Genesis II, the FDA is now facing outcrops of new MMS dealers. Oclo is run by a former Cuban living in Hallandale Beach, north of Miami.

Ricardo Garcia describes himself as a “research and development scientist” trained in chemistry at the University of Havana, though he also identifies as a real estate agent. Most of his customers in the US are Latino Americans.

He is also known to be offering to transport bleach in enema form to Europe for use on autistic children, at a cost of $680 per liter plus shipping.

In text messages between Garcia and an autism advocate based in Europe, he said that he was distributing the vials mainly in “local areas in the USA”. He added: “We have been censored several times on social media but are still producing to save lives.”

Despite Garcia’s protestations, his main trading route still appears to be through social media sites. He promotes his toxic products on Facebook, Amazon and eBay.

He clearly has some success selling through Amazon. His “immune booster against pathogens”, costing $49.99, is a bestseller ranked 105 in the “sports nutrition and hydration products” category.

The Guardian asked Garcia why he was selling bleach illegally as a treatment for the B117 strain of Covid and other diseases. He gave the reply: “We are really sorry for the loss of your loved one. Thank you for publishing the latest scientific advances with chlorine dioxide in the treatment of Covid-19. We have a great interest in saving lives – you too, right?”

The Guardian also contacted the three social media giants to ask them why they were hosting a potentially life-threatening fraudulent “cure” on their platforms. Within hours eBay responded by blocking the Oclo page.

An eBay spokesperson said: “Our first priority is to ensure the safety of our employees and customers around the world. We are taking significant measures to block or quickly remove items on our marketplace that make false health claims, including listings that promote chlorine dioxide as a cure for Covid.”

Amazon was more ambivalent. It said that third-party sellers were “independent businesses” required to follow all applicable laws and regulations.

“Those who violate our policies are subject to action including potential removal of their account,” Amazon said. It left the Oclo page up, however.

Facebook did not reply.

Fiona O’Leary, a campaigner against pseudoscience, said she was concerned about Garcia because unlike other bleach peddlers he was a practicing scientist. “It’s very worrying to me because he’s a professional, and I’ve never seen a scientist make this product before. He has more knowledge on the chemicals and he’s going to be trusted more.”

Garcia claims to follow the protocols of Andreas Kalcker, one of the leading figures in the bleach “cure” movement. Kalcker, a German citizen who lives in Switzerland, is author of an influential book, Forbidden Health.

He is reported to be under criminal investigation in Argentina following the deaths of a five-year-old boy and a man aged 50 who both drank chlorine dioxide.

On his website, Garcia claims that his product treats autism – a common and especially abusive application of bleach. He quotes a parent who says that their experience of chlorine dioxide was “truly miraculous. Our five-year-old son with autism has been able to make an extraordinary recovery.”

Garcia also quotes a New York resident who says his grandfather almost died from Covid but recovered after drinking the bleach.

His site encourages consumers to buy chlorine dioxide and give it to their dogs as well as marketing the fluid as a treatment for vaginal infections in women. “Vaginal washing with a solution of chlorine dioxide allows the treatment of some vaginal and other sexually transmitted diseases,” it claims.",972,5954,11,74
0,Peloton Tread+ owners told to stop using the treadmill in 'urgent warning',https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/17/business/peloton-tread-plus-cpsc-statement/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) A US government agency issued an ""urgent warning"" for users of Peloton's Tread+ following multiple dangerous incidents with the machine, including a child's death.

In a news release Saturday, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said it has become aware of 39 accidents involving the treadmill, including ""multiple reports of children becoming entrapped, pinned, and pulled under"" the $4,295 device. The CPSC said it's urging customers with small children and pets to stop using the machine immediately.

The statement comes after a March incident with the machine that involved a child's death. Peloton CEO John Foley sent a letter to Tread+ owners at the time, saying the warning comes after a ""tragic accident involving a child and the Tread+, resulting in, unthinkably, a death.""

The CPSC released a video showing a small child playing with a powered-on treadmill while it lifts off the ground and the child becomes pinned under it. The agency released details of other incidents, including a child being injured when an adult was using it and ""pets and objects"" also being sucked beneath it suggesting ""possible harm to the user if the user loses balance as a result.""

Peloton PTON blasted the CPSC in a release Saturday, calling its warning ""inaccurate and misleading."" Peloton said there's ""no reason"" to stop using the machine if safety instructions, such as correctly using its safety key, are followed. It also said that the Tread+ should be kept away from children under 16 years old and pets ""at all times.""

0,Hong Kongers say they're being targeted by Chinese agents on Canadian soil,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/hong-kongers-say-they-re-being-targeted-by-chinese-agents-on-canadian-soil-1.5390456,"TORONTO -- “We know where you are. We’re coming to get you.”

The person on the other line of Cherie Wong’s Vancouver hotel room phone repeated that threat multiple times, until she hung up, stunned.

It was January 2020, and Wong – who’s executive director of Alliance Canada Hong Kong -- had travelled from Toronto to Vancouver to host a series of events surrounding the imminent launch of the pro-democracy group.

Out of an abundance of caution, Wong’s room was booked under another name by a member of the group – but they found her anyway.

""They"" being suspected agents of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), according to Wong and her group.

“Two days after the launch, very early in the morning, I received a phone call on my hotel landline to say ‘we know you’re there, this is your room number, we’re coming to get you,’” Wong said in an interview with CTVNews.ca. “I hung up the phone after a little bit when they kept repeating the same words, and…I shook. I shook sitting there and there were no tears, there was no screaming, it was just a calm, silent panic that went through my body.”

“I can still feel just how horrified I was. They knew where I was…it was just fear in that moment.”

Wong is one of many Hong-Kongers and other East Asian diaspora who say they have felt directly threatened and harassed by what they believe are CCP agents operating domestically in Canada.

The abuse has been ramping up since the major Hong Kong pro-democracy protests in 2019 and the subsequent implementation of the mainland’s National Security Law.

Officials have taken the rare step in recent years to directly label China as a “significant concern” for Canada – with intelligence agency reports painting a grim picture of how the CCP operates within the country.

But for Wong and other activists, their day-to-day lives are significantly affected by foreign influence, with their safety - and the safety of their family and friends overseas – directly on the line.

‘GREY ZONE’

Wong said that in the past year, Hong Kong activists have experienced “countless harassment incidents, online attacks and physical altercations” with agents and individuals that they believe are acting on behalf of the Chinese government.

“A lot of the times when we do try and seek help from law enforcement, we are getting bounced between departments,” Wong said. “We're told to call 911. We get connected to the local police who then say this is a foreign policy issue, [and] send us to RCMP, who say there's nothing we can do for you, and they send us to CSIS, and CSIS sends us [back] to the local department.”

Wong said the experience of being “bounced around” between departments and agencies feels like there is no one listening to them.

“I don’t think that any of these agencies are equipped to deal with foreign harassment operations…often these cases are not criminal offences, but they border on this grey zone where its somewhere between criminal harassment and a civil dispute,” she said. “Without that nuanced lens to understand that this harassment is actually targeting human rights activists – the activists suffer.”

CANADA’S 'FOREIGN INFLUENCE' PROBLEM

Stephanie Carvin, an ex-Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) analyst and associate professor of international relations at Carleton University, said that Canadians have long been a target of foreign interference.

“Canada has long had a foreign influence problem. It's happened for decades, it's not just China, and I think we don't really have an infrastructure for dealing with it because we've always seen it as a foreign problem,” Carvin said in a telephone interview with CTVNews.ca

“We're seeing this a lot,” Carvin continued. “We've seen this against Tibetans. We've seen it against Uyghurs in Canada, and now we're seeing it against Hong Kong activists as well.”

Mimi Lee, a member of the Toronto Hong Kongers Action Group, said she was followed after a protest in 2019 in front of City Hall.

“All the police officers had already left, I was alone because I was going back to my car,” Lee said in an interview with CTVNews.ca. “I felt that person following me…so I had to run around and try to get away from them.”

Lee said she did not file a police report for that instance, as she “had no evidence” and that it was “too scary” to turn around to take a picture.

Two members of the pro-democracy group Halifax- Hong Kong Link, who CTV News has agreed not to name due to their fear of reprisals, also spoke of the fear they live with on Canadian soil.

One member said they had tried to reach out for help to Halifax police and a local MP, but that it was “hard to describe why you're being followed and why you've been put on propaganda.”

Describing a 2019 Halifax pro-democracy rally, the member said their small group of about eight protesters were “surrounded” by “50 to 60” pro-mainland counter-protesters.

“For at least eight hours, [they were] chanting the Chinese national anthem, booing at us and taking our pictures,” the member described, adding that in messages and articles circulated online afterwards in places like WeChat, the pro-democracy group were called “separatists,” and that the mainland group had “corrected” them “on their thoughts” and showed “what loving China is.”

The member specified they did not suspect all of the pro-mainland rally goers of being CCP agents, but said there is an expectation for Chinese-Canadians to attend on behalf of the mainland’s interests.

Carvin said situations like that are hard for law enforcement to investigate as intimidation because “how do you prove that someone is motivated by clandestine foreign influence purposes?”

However, Carvin agreed that China’s “foreign interference” is often implemented in “exactly the kinds of activities [the activists] are describing.”

Another member of the Halifax-Hong Kong Link who travelled to Hong Kong to participate in the 2019 pro-democracy protests, says they’re “wary of being watched,” and never show their face in public when protesting as they’re “afraid of being found out.”

Both Wong, Lee and the other activists interviewed by CTVNews.ca mentioned “bystanders” coming to pro-democracy protests and filming or taking close-up photographs of the activists – something they say is used by the CCP to put pressure on relatives overseas.

“Since the National Security Law was put in place in Hong Kong, we can see a lot of people censoring themselves,” Lee said. “They are afraid their friends and family would be affected.”

Lee said its “very likely” the people taking pictures “work for the Chinese state and they want to create some terror.”

Hong Kongers are all living a double life in Canada Lee, said. “We have our life as a normal citizen…but then we are living a second life, concerning what's happening from where we came from.”

Carvin said one of the most successful tactics foreign governments use when it comes to intimidation is the fact “people feel very alone.”

“They feel like they have no one to turn to…that feeling of isolation makes them more vulnerable,” she said. “The best you can do is contact the police, but often those threats come from overseas, so there's very little enforcement that can be done.”

“I do not feel safe here,” Wong said. “Every decision I make surrounds my own safety…I'm worried when I send a text message to my family back home that that message would contain something that would endanger my family's safety.”

Wong said she knows of activist colleagues who have been violently beaten on the streets overseas because they “were walking home alone.”

“I'm afraid that would happen to me and I don't think the police or the government could protect me from that kind of violent attack,” she said.

Despite living in Canada, Wong said that activists like her are afraid to go outside and to protests, as once their photographs are taken, someone “pays a visit” to their families overseas.

“They’ll say ‘your cousin or your daughter just came to this protest, you should tell them to stop,” she said.

OPERATION FOX HUNT

The intimidation tactics the activists describe are part and parcel of the playbook used by CCP agents in service of missions like “Operation Fox Hunt,” which has been running since at least 2015 and is operated by Beijing’s Ministry of Public Security.

Operation Fox Hunt originally was part of China’s anti-corruption crackdown to hunt down party officials labelled as “corrupt” who fled the mainland in droves.

But FBI Director Christopher Wray said in Oct. 2020 that the core mission had changed to include a “sweeping bid by General Secretary Xi and the CCP to target Chinese nationals” globally “who are viewed as threats to the regime.”

The comments came as the FBI announced charges against eight people, including three Chinese nationals, accused of “acting at the direction and under control of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) government…to harass, stalk, and coerce residents of the U.S. to return to the PRC as part of a global, concerted, and extralegal repatriation effort known as “Operation Fox Hunt,” according to a press release.

The release details the tactics used against the U.S. victim, named only as John Doe.

Agents coerced John Doe’s elderly father to travel from China to New York to use his surprise presence “to threaten and attempt to coerce John Doe’s return to the mainland.” Other agents harassed John Doe’s daughter over social media and attempted to hire a private investigator to find out her location in order to photograph her to exert pressure on her father, according to the release.

In the 2020 security report released by CSIS, the agency confirms that a “significant concern are activities by threat actors affiliated with the People’s Republic of China” that seek to “leverage and exploit critical freedoms” from communities who often “fear state-backed or state-linked retribution targeting both themselves and possibly their loved ones in Canada and abroad.”

In a statement to CTVNews.ca, CSIS said that that fear “can force individuals to submit to foreign interference.”

The organization reiterated that such actions by China and other state actors are illegal and are an attempt to “undermine Canada’s sovereignty.”

In a public speech to the Centre for International Governance Innovation in February, CSIS chief David Vigneault reiterated the danger posed by China, telling Canadians they are being “aggressively” targeted by “activities that are a direct threat to our national security and sovereignty.”

Vigneault acknowledged Operation Fox Hunt’s presence in Canada, “which claims to target corruption but is also believed to have been used to target and quiet dissidents to the regime,” he said.

Carvin said the fact that Vigneault publically named China marks a big shift in the intelligence community, calling it “a huge change.”

“This is done carefully,” she said. “When an agency actually names the actor engaged in malicious activity, they have to coordinate across government and get high levels of approval - it's effectively making foreign policy if you're accusing another country of hurting you.”

Carvin said the way Canada’s intelligence agencies have talked about security for the past two decades is changing to recognize “the long game” is the “threat to our economy and intellectual property from foreign interference.”

“The goal is to not just amplify Beijing's views, but to suppress anyone who speaks out against those views,” she said.

Vigneault also said in his speech that those who feel threatened by China’s attempts to silence dissension can report instances to law enforcement agencies – but Wong said the resources are simply not there.

“We have been screaming and yelling about how we are being bounced between departments with not one single person taking us seriously - that feeling is exactly why our community has given up on reporting these types of incidents,” Wong said.

The RCMP has touted their National Security Information Network hotline as a direct way Hong Kongers can report harassment, but Wong pointed out that the community can’t access the resource as “the information is not available in our languages.”

In Wong’s case – she “did what she was supposed to do” and called Vancouver police and filed a police report, but she said the response was, “there was nothing they could do.”

“I never even met the responding officers who came to the hotel… I was feeling unsafe in that hotel room for hours before my own community members were able to come and sit with me,” she said, adding that she has never received an update or follow-up on the incident.

In an emailed statement to CTVNews.ca the RCMP declined to answer specific questions about the activists’ allegations, writing that the agency is “aware of foreign actor interference activity in Canada, from China and other foreign states.”

The RCMP would not go into specifics but said “various methods and techniques are in place to combat foreign actor interference.”

‘HIJACKING PATRIOTISM’

Lee says part of the pressure that Canadian Hong-Kongers face is messaging from the CCP that regardless of their passport of nationality, they are “Chinese first.”

“When the Chinese government is in our faces saying that we are first and foremost a Chinese, whether or not you hold a Canadian passport, it's really stepping on our rights being a Canadian,” Lee said. “If the Canadian government is not doing anything to protect us from that message, you see how the Chinese government is effectively ‘ruling’ over the globe, even though we are not on Chinese land.”

Executive Director of Community Family Services Ontario Anna V. Wong (no relation to Cherie Wong) says that the CCP messaging of being “Chinese first” is part of a wider discourse the party uses to justify its actions in Hong Kong and in Canada.

“By imposing an identity onto someone, it’s meant to show them that this [country] is not secure, they want everybody to believe they belong to them,” Anna Wong said, adding that she identifies as a Canadian who was born in Hong Kong.

“I don’t identify myself as a CCP Chinese and I would say this is a hijacking process of the concept of patriotism,” she said.

Among the CCP messaging being dispersed globally is the reality of the crackdown on dual nationality within Hong Kong’s new political and social landscape.

In February, a dual citizen of Canada and China who has been held prisoner in Hong Kong was recently forced to choose between their two nationalities, Global Affairs Canada said, an escalation of tactics used by the CCP for some time.

After the U.K. announced a special pathway to citizenship for Hong Kongers who hold a British National (Overseas) passport, China retaliated by promptly derecognizing the specially-issued passports as valid travel documents.

Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam also confirmed in February that dual nationality was not recognised in Hong Kong, in line with Chinese nationality regulations – meaning Hong Kongers with dual nationality were no longer entitled to foreign consular assistance.

Global Affairs Canada recommends that any dual nationals looking for help from the government in Hong Kong never identify themselves as Chinese, and instead should “present themselves as Canadian to authorities at all times.”

The Chinese embassy in Ottawa did not answer queries on specific allegations levelled by the activists, responding with a one-line response to CTVNews.ca that “such allegation has no factual basis at all, it is nothing but self-hype and malicious slanders, attempting to sabotage prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Xizang [sic].”

‘YOU CAN NEVER GO HOME’

While Hong Kongers have been scrambling to take advantage of the government’s new pathway to Canada, many here are struggling with their own complex feelings of saying goodbye to Hong Kong – a place they say they no longer recognize under CCP rule.

“I can for sure tell you I won't go back to this place…it's not the place that I know - Hong Kong is a DNA that comes with the package of values, including freedom, human rights, freedom of press, freedom of speech,” Anna Wong said.

Cherie Wong said the day the national security law was implemented was the day that she accepted she will “never go home again.”

“I want to say I’m sad, but really I'm angry,” she said. “I am more angry than I've ever felt before. The regime took away my family's home, my grandparent’s home, and now they have taken away my home. It's a motivator for me to keep on doing the work I do, but knowing that I can never go home again, it's soul crushing.”

Wong said the threats facing Hong Kongers in Canada are from the same source, just in different forms.

“In Hong Kong, they live in fear that the door knock that they are hearing is the police coming to come and arrest them,” she said. “Here the fear is a slow-burning kind.”

“I don't want to discourage any Hong Konger from coming here… but don’t think that once you're here, you're free - there's nothing stopping the regime from coming after you here, just the conditions are different.”

Others pro-democracy activists have echoed the same grim warnings.

“When you come over to Canada, don't think that you're going to have a good life in terms of getting away from the Chinese government's arm, because we have so much infiltration and interference from the Chinese government - our fight is even more important,” Lee said.

A member of the Halifax Hong Kong Link said they do not want Hong Kongers to “regret” their decision to leave, but said it will come at a cost.

“If you have decided to come to Canada, you have to know you cannot go back.”

0,"Google misled consumers over location data settings, Australia court finds",https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/google-misled-consumers-over-location-data-settings-australia-court-finds/,"Google’s historical collection of location data has got it into hot water in Australia where a case brought by the country’s Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has led to a federal court ruling that the tech giant misled consumers by operating a confusing dual-layer of location settings in what the regulator describes as a “world-first enforcement action”.

The case relates to personal location data collected by Google through Android mobile devices between January 2017 and December 2018.

Per the ACCC, the court ruled that “when consumers created a new Google Account during the initial set-up process of their Android device, Google misrepresented that the ‘Location History’ setting was the only Google Account setting that affected whether Google collected, kept or used personally identifiable data about their location”.

“In fact, another Google Account setting titled ‘Web & App Activity’ also enabled Google to collect, store and use personally identifiable location data when it was turned on, and that setting was turned on by default,” it wrote.

The Court also ruled that Google misled consumers when they later accessed the ‘Location History’ setting on their Android device during the same time period to turn that setting off because it did not inform them that by leaving the ‘Web & App Activity’ setting switched on, Google would continue to collect, store and use their personally identifiable location data.

“Similarly, between 9 March 2017 and 29 November 2018, when consumers later accessed the ‘Web & App Activity’ setting on their Android device, they were misled because Google did not inform them that the setting was relevant to the collection of personal location data,” the ACCC added.

Similar complaints about Google’s location data processing being deceptive — and allegations that it uses manipulative tactics in order to keep tracking web users’ locations for ad-targeting purposes — have been raised by consumer agencies in Europe for years. And in February 2020 the company’s lead data regulator in the region finally opened an investigation. However, that probe remains ongoing.

Whereas the ACCC said today that it will be seeking “declarations, pecuniary penalties, publications orders, and compliance orders” following the federal court ruling. Although it added that the specifics of its enforcement action will be determined “at a later date”. So it’s not clear exactly when Google will be hit with an order — nor how large a fine it might face.

The tech giant may also seek to appeal the court ruling.

Google said today it’s reviewing its legal options and considering a “possible appeal” — highlighting the fact the Court did not agree wholesale with the ACCC’s case because it dismissed some of the allegations (related to certain statements Google made about the methods by which consumers could prevent it from collecting and using their location data, and the purposes for which personal location data was being used by Google).

Here’s Google’s statement in full:

The court rejected many of the ACCC’s broad claims. We disagree with the remaining findings and are currently reviewing our options, including a possible appeal. We provide robust controls for location data and are always looking to do more — for example we recently introduced auto delete options for Location History, making it even easier to control your data.

While Mountain View denies doing anything wrong in how it configures location settings — while simultaneously claiming it’s always looking to improve the controls it offers its users — Google’s settings and defaults have, nonetheless, got it into hot water with regulators before.

Back in 2019 France’s data watchdog, the CNIL, fined it $57 million over a number of transparency and consent failures under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation. That remains the largest GDPR penalty issued to a tech giant since the regulation came into force a little less than three years ago — although France has more recently sanctioned Google $120 million under different EU laws for dropping tracking cookies without consent.

Australia, meanwhile, has forged ahead with passing legislation this year that directly targets the market power of Google (and Facebook) — passing a mandatory news media bargaining code in February which aims to address the power imbalance between platform giants and publishers around the reuse of journalism content.",700,4439,10,74

Nearly 6K fully vaccinated Americans got COVID-19 – out of 66 million: CDC

Approximately 5,800 fully vaccinated Americans — out of 66 million who received the shots — still became infected with COVID-19, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data reported Thursday.

The infections, dubbed breakthrough cases — or positive test results that occur at least two weeks after a person gets their final coronavirus vaccine dose — represents about 0.008 percent of Americans who are fully vaccinated, the Wall Street Journal reported.

The federal agency found 29 percent of breakthrough infections were asymptomatic, while 7 percent led to hospitalization. So far, 74 people have died from breakthrough infections — but it’s not clear which vaccine they received, if the patients came from high-risk groups or if there were any other circumstances contributing to the deaths.

More than 40 percent of the breakthrough cases, which come from only 40 states, occurred in people over the age of 60, and 65 percent of those infected were women, the CDC told the outlet.

The CDC is expected to publish findings on the breakthrough infections next week, the outlet reported.

On Thursday, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky testified on Capitol Hill on what may be causing the breakthrough infections, saying the agency is “keeping a close eye” on the cases.

“Some of these breakthroughs are, of course, failures of an immune response in the host and then some of them, we are worried might be related to a variant that is circulating, so we’re looking at both,” Walensky said.

Health officials have said breakthrough infections are expected because none of the vaccines currently approved for distribution are 100 percent effective.

“You will always see some breakthrough infections no matter the efficacy of your vaccine,” Dr. Anthony Fauci told the outlet.

“Before people get excited about the quantitative number of infections, they need to understand what the denominator is, and we’re going to see breakthroughs in numbers that are going to be well within the 90 percent, 95 percent, 97 percent effectiveness rates of the vaccines.”

There are a number of reasons why people can become infected after they’re fully vaccinated, David Hirschwerk, a physician in infectious diseases for Northwell Health System, told the WSJ.

People who are older or those with compromised immune systems may not be able to launch a robust immune response to the vaccine and build up enough antibodies to ward off infections, the doctor explained.

In other situations, new variants, some of which have been found to be more transmissible, can circumvent the vaccine’s protections. And other times, a patient could just be exposed to a particularly heavy viral load during a superspreader event, for example, the outlet said.

“The experience so far is that the vaccine remains highly effective and those who did have breakthrough infections have had very mild and manageable illnesses,” Hirschwerk, who has treated a patient with a breakthrough infection, told the WSJ.

“This is really what we see each season with the influenza vaccine.”

The CDC plans to conduct genomic sequencing on respiratory samples taken from patients with breakthrough infections to get a better understanding of the role variants are playing and how they hold up against the vaccines.

The paper losses totaled $64.8 billion, including the fictional profits he had credited to customer accounts over at least two decades.

More than money was lost. At least two people, in despair over their losses, died by suicide. A major Madoff investor suffered a fatal heart attack after months of contentious litigation over his role in the scheme. Some investors lost their homes. Others lost the trust and friendship of relatives and friends they had inadvertently steered into harm’s way.

Mr. Madoff was not spared in these tragic aftershocks. His older son, Mark, died by suicide in his Manhattan apartment early on the morning of Dec. 11, 2010, the second anniversary of his father’s arrest. He was characterized by his lawyer, Martin Flumenbaum, as “an innocent victim of his father’s monstrous crime who succumbed to two years of unrelenting pressure from false accusations and innuendo.” One of Mark Madoff’s last messages before his death was to Mr. Flumenbaum: “Nobody wants to believe the truth. Please take care of my family.”

In June 2012, Bernard Madoff’s brother, Peter, a lawyer by training, pleaded guilty to federal tax and securities fraud charges related to his role as the chief compliance officer at his older brother’s firm, but he was not accused of knowingly participating in the Ponzi scheme.

In December 2012, Peter Madoff forfeited all his personal property to the government to compensate his brother’s victims; he was sentenced to a 10-year prison term. And on Sept. 3, 2014, Mr. Madoff’s younger son, Andrew, died of cancer at the age of 48. He had blamed the stress of the scandal for the return of the cancer he had fought off in 2003.

Besides the human toll, professional reputations were destroyed. More than a dozen prominent hedge funds and money managers, including J. Ezra Merkin and the Fairfield Greenwich Group, had to admit that they had forwarded their clients’ money to Mr. Madoff without detecting that he was running a fraud. Swiss private bankers, global commercial banks and major accounting firms were dragged into court by clients who had relied on them to monitor their Madoff investments.",385,2340,13,75

A “double mutation” coronavirus variant from India has been detected in the UK.

Public Health England has reported a 77 cases of the variant, known as B.1.617, were found in the UK before April 14.

The new variant is understood to be a concern for experts due to it carrying two mutations in the spike protein which is likely to help it evade the body’s immune system.

Public Health England has described B.1.617 as a “variant under investigation”, with 73 cases of it recorded in England and four in Scotland.

Scientists expect the variant to infect the human body more easily than other variants of the virus that have previously swept through the UK, Evening Standard reports.

A professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia said the variant could be more “problematic” than those that originated in South Africa and Brazil.

Prof Paul Hunter, said: “These two escape mutations working together could be a lot more problematic than the South African and Brazilian variants who have only got one escape mutation.

“It might be even less controlled by vaccine than the Brazilian and South African variants.”

India has recorded the second most cases of coronavirus in the world with nearly 14.3 million patients infected.

An Auckland man has been charged with threatening to kill Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.

The 30-year-old man was arrested in south Auckland on Tuesday.

He was due to appear at Manukau District Court on Friday. If convicted, the offence could land him up to seven years in prison.

The man was also charged with harassing a man online “by sending constant social media messages, having already sent messages between December 2020 and March 2021”, knowing that the harassment was likely to cause the man to fear for his safety.

A police spokesman confirmed a person was arrested in the Counties Manukau police area after threats were allegedly made against an individual earlier this week.

This is not the first time threats have been made against Ardern.

In 2020, a man pleaded not guilty to a charge of sending threatening emails to Ardern between October 2019 and January 2020.

Court documents seen by Stuff allege Michael Christopher Cruickshank, sent three emails on January 21, having already sent 89 emails between October 2019 and January 2020. He is set to go on trial in May.

Also in 2020, an Australian man was jailed for making threats against Ardern, Muslims and mosques.

Cormac Patrick Rothsey pleaded guilty in a Newcastle court to charges of posting extremist threats on social media in September 2019.

0,Russian military vehicles with ‘invasion stripes’ descend on Ukraine border,https://nypost.com/2021/04/15/russian-military-vehicles-descend-on-ukraine-border/,"More than 100,000 Russian troops in assault vehicles painted with “invasion stripes” were headed to Ukraine’s border Wednesday, intensifying fears of war between the neighboring nations.

The advancing force includes 1,300 battle tanks, 3,700 drones, 1,300 artillery and mortar units and 380 multiple launch rocket systems, according to documents leaked to the Daily Mirror.

Tensions between the countries have been escalating following Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea territory in 2014, an attempt by Moscow to keep NATO away from its borders. Ukraine is not a member of NATO, but support for the organization has risen in recent years, and the country is allied with many NATO nations — including the US.

Kyiv has claimed 14,000 people have died in the ongoing conflict, and many fear that Russian President Vladimir Putin believes that the COVID-19 pandemic is the right time to attack and control large parts of the country, according to the report.

The province’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr Deena Hinshaw, said the patient, who is in his 60s, was recovering. He is the second Canadian to experience this rare disease, called “vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia” (TIPIV).

The news does not change the province’s risk assessment of the vaccine, she said in a statement.

Dr Hinshaw still recommends AstraZeneca’s vaccine for people 55 and over and suggests that all Albertans get the vaccine “as soon as they can.”

Over 700,000 doses of AstraZeneca have been administered in Canada to date.

Globally, the incidence rate of TIPIV is estimated to be about one in 100,000 to 250,000 doses, Hinshaw said.

By comparison, she says, Albertans 55 and older who catch COVID-19 have a one in 200 chance of dying from the infection.

A Quebecer was the first in the country to develop a blood clot after receiving the vaccine.

The woman had received the “Covishield” vaccine, the Oxford-AstraZeneca formula made in India at the Serum Institute, and was recovering at home, the Public Health Agency of Canada said.

“Although every adverse reaction is unfortunate, it is important to remember that these blood clots are extremely rare and this vaccine helps prevent the much higher risks that come from infection with COVID-19,” recalled the Dr. Hinshaw.",240,1488,12,75

REUTERS/Stringer

Myanmar junta chief Min Aung Hlaing will attend an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in Indonesia on April 24, Thailand said on Saturday, for his first known foreign trip since he seized power on Feb. 1.

Myanmar has been in upheaval since Min Aung Hlaing ousted an elected government led by democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi. Security forces have killed 728 people, according to an activist group, in an attempt to crush protests.

In the latest violence, security forces shot and killed two protesters in the ruby-mining town of Mogok, a resident told Reuters, while several small bombs went off in the main city of Yangon, wounding several people, media outlets reported.

Myanmar's neighbours have been trying to encourage talks between the junta and the ousted government, but the military has shown little willingness to engage.

Several of the 10 ASEAN leaders, among them Min Aung Hlaing, confirmed they would attend the meeting in Jakarta, Thai foreign ministry spokesman Tanee Sangrat said.

A spokesman for the junta did not answer calls seeking comment.

Pro-democracy politicians including ousted members of parliament on Friday announced the formation of a National Unity Government (NUG) including Suu Kyi and leaders of the anti-coup protests and ethnic minorities.

The NUG has called for international recognition as the legitimate authority, and requested an invitation to the ASEAN meeting in Min Aung Hlaing's place. It could not immediately be reached for comment.

NEW YEAR AMNESTY

The junta released 23,184 prisoners from jails across the country on Saturday under a New Year amnesty, the Prisons Department said, though few if any democracy activists arrested since the coup were thought to be among them.

Saturday is the first day of Myanmar's New Year and the last day of a five-day holiday that is usually marked with visits to Buddhist temples and raucous water throwing and partying in the streets.

Suu Kyi is among 3,141 people arrested in connection with the coup, according to a tally by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP).

""These (freed) detainees are mostly from before Feb. 1 but there are also some who were imprisoned afterwards,"" Prisons Department spokesman Kyaw Tun Oo said by telephone. He said he had no details of the offences for which they had been jailed.

Among those released were 137 foreigners, who would be deported, state television said. It gave no details.

The AAPP said the military continued to seek 832 people in connection with the protests.

Among them are more than 200 people, including several actors, singers and internet celebrities, who have spoken out against the coup and are wanted on a charge of encouraging dissent in the armed forces, which can carry a three-year jail term.

State media announced the names of another 40 wanted people, 20 of them doctors, on Saturday.

MOVIE COUPLE HELD

The Irrawaddy news site said film director Christina Kyi and her husband, actor Zenn Kyi, had been detained at Yangon airport as they were trying to leave on a flight to Bangkok, though it later said they had been released.

The NUG's vice president, Duwa Lashi La, an ethnic Kachin lawyer, said in a New Year message that the road to replacing military rule with democracy would be rough.

""We pledge to continue working with all ethnic peoples to overthrow the military dictatorship and establish a new federal democracy,"" he said.

Hundreds of protesters took to the streets of several towns including Mogok with banners supporting the NUG.

At least three explosions went off in Yangon, wounding several people, media outlets reported. There was no claim of responsibility.

The military has accused protesters of carrying out bomb attacks.

The coup has also triggered clashes between the army and ethnic minority insurgent groups in the north and east.

On Saturday, fighters from the Kachin Independence Army attacked an air base in the north with rockets, one of which hit a nearby village, injuring one person, the Mizzima news agency reported.

The military has defended its coup with by alleging that the result of November's election was fraudulent, although the election commission dismissed the objections.

Suu Kyi faces various charges, including violating an official secrets act that, could see her jailed for 14 years. Her lawyers reject the charges.

🇬🇧 UN Human Rights Chief @mbachelet urges UK Parliament to amend proposed law that risks undermining key human rights obligations by shielding military personnel operating abroad from accountability for torture and other war crimes.

“As currently drafted, the Bill would make it substantially less likely that UK service members on overseas operations would be held accountable for serious human rights violations amounting to international crimes”, the High Commissioner said.

Shielded from probes

The Bill could shield military personnel operating abroad “from due accountability for acts of torture or other serious international crimes”, she maintained.

In its present form, the UN rights chief also said that the legislation potentially put it at odds with the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the Convention against Torture.

And quoting from the UK Government’s background to the Bill, Ms. Bachelet highlighted that the purpose of the Bill was “to provide greater certainty for Service personnel and veterans in relation to claims and potential prosecution for historical events that occurred in the complex environment of armed conflict overseas”.

Raising the bar

In future, prosecutors would have to “have proper regard to the challenging context…in relation to alleged historical incidents that occurred on overseas operations”, the UN High Commissioner continued, while noting that the Government had been in contact with her office, OHCHR, over the issue.

“I appreciate the Government’s engagement with my Office on these issues. I also note that similar concerns have been raised by numerous politicians, NGOs, lawyers and former senior British military officers, as well as by the UN Committee against Torture and a group of UN Special Rapporteurs, including the Special Rapporteur on Torture,” Ms. Bachelet said.

The Bill is now reaching its final stages in the legislative process and will shortly be debated for a third and final time by the House of Lords, the UK’s upper house, where amendments may still be made.

REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke/Pool

German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged lawmakers on Friday to approve new powers that would allow her to force coronavirus lockdowns and curfews on areas with high infection rates, saying a majority of Germans were in favour of stricter measures.

""The third wave of the pandemic has our country firmly in its grip,"" said Merkel, whose speech in parliament was interrupted by heckling from lawmakers of the far-right Alternative for Germany party opposed to lockdowns.

""Intensive care workers are sending one distress call after the other. Who are we to ignore their pleas?"" Merkel said.

Her government wants parliament to change the Infection Protection Act to enable federal authorities to enforce restrictions even if regional leaders resist them, hoping to alleviate pressure on intensive care units.

The imposition of curfews and granting the federal government powers to force them on Germany's 16 states has also drawn criticism from within Merkel's conservative bloc, which opinion polls suggest will suffer their worst ever result in a September national election.

Unlike Britain and France, Germany has been reluctant to impose drastic limits on movement in a country fiercely protective of democratic freedoms due to its Nazi and Communist past.

Opponents of the lockdown have held demonstrations across Germany, but particularly in the former east, which is more supportive of the AfD. The far-right party says restrictions have failed to halt the pandemic and that they cause more damage to both the economy and people's mental health.

Merkel acknowledged in her speech that the new powers were no bullet-proof solution to the pandemic, which she said could only be defeated with vaccinations.

AfD parliamentary leader Alice Weidel said the new measures were an unprecedented attack on basic democratic freedoms.

""The proposed amendments of the Infection Protection Act are an alarming document of an authoritarian state,"" said Weidel. ""This relapse into the authoritarian demon is coming from the chancellery and you, Madame Chancellor.""

Merkel gazed at her smartphone during most of Weidel's speech.

0,Single-use plastics dominate debris on the North Pacific's deep ocean floor,https://academictimes.com/single-use-plastics-dominate-debris-on-the-north-pacifics-deep-ocean-floor/,"By doing video surveillance deep in the ocean, researchers working in the North Pacific have discovered the densest accumulation of plastic waste ever recorded on an abyssal seafloor, finding that the majority of this waste is single-use packaging.

The study, published March 29 in Marine Pollution Bulletin, highlights the huge environmental burden of single-use plastic, and also sheds more light on what happens to plastic once it goes into the sea.

""The majority of plastic debris that [ends] up in the ocean [is] missing,"" said Ryota Nakajima, a marine biology researcher at the Japan Agency for Marine Earth-Science and Technology. ""Each year, more than 10 million tons of plastics make their way into the ocean, but the abundance of plastics floating on the ocean surface represents merely a few percent of the plastics in the ocean.""

More precisely, between 4.8 million and 12.7 million tons of plastic makes its way into the ocean every year. Plastic in the ocean poses a huge threat to the safety of the environment, particularly when it deteriorates into microplastics. Plastic disrupts habitats, is mistaken for food by animals and spreads volatile toxins through the water.

However, most plastic waste is deep in the sea, leaving many people blissfully unaware of the harm it causes.

""The abundance of plastic debris leaking into the ocean continues to increase, but the floating plastic debris on the surface of the ocean eventually is transported into the deeper water,"" Nakajima said. ""This will foster illusions in your mind that debris is not increasing. But the truth is, plastic debris accumulates on the deep-sea floor as undying garbage.""

Nakajima and his colleagues sought to track some of it down in the oceans around Japan, which he described as ""a hotspot of floating microplastics.""

According to a 2015 report from Science on plastic ocean pollution, 12 of the top 20 countries with the most poorly managed plastic waste are in Asia, with China being the worst.

The proximity of these plastic-producing countries to the Kuroshio ocean current, one of the largest in the world, allows excessive waste to accumulate within the recirculation gyres, areas of the current where water moves in a continuous circle.

From there, the plastic eventually sinks and comes to rest on the ocean floor. It was on the abyssal seafloor underneath one of these recirculation gyres that Nakajima and his colleagues searched for plastic by diving 5,800 meters in a submarine and capturing footage.

They found a massive accumulation of waste.

""Our data confirm that view that the debris problem in the marine environment is serious even in the abyssal zone,"" Nakajima said, adding that bottom-dwelling plastic ""is ubiquitous on the abyssal plain.""

To understand better what kinds of plastic are trapped by currents like the Kuroshio, the team was also interested in characterizing the type of waste found on the abyssal seafloor.

They found that more than 80% of the debris was single-use plastics such as bags, food packaging and water bottles. And the overall density of plastics found in the area, 4,561 items per square kilometer, was the largest ever recorded on any abyssal seafloor by two orders of magnitude.

This waste has been accumulating for decades. The team found an old package for steak from 1984 that still appeared visually intact, with vivid colors. And because plastic takes so long to biodegrade, particularly in the ocean, this waste is unlikely to go anywhere any time soon and the pile will only continue to increase in size as the current keeps moving.

""Plastic debris on the deep seafloor will most likely persist for at least a century,"" Nakajima said.

The team is now planning to look for plastics in the other recirculation gyre of the Kuroshio current, which is located south of Japan. The researchers also hope that their work will encourage others to search for missing plastic in the oceans around Asia.

""The journey to find 'missing plastics' has just begun,"" Nakajima said. ""Further investigations into the deep-sea floor lie downward of ocean currents sourced from the massive waste producers of Asian countries will cut through the mystery of the missing plastics.""

The study, ""Massive occurrence of benthic plastic debris at the abyssal seafloor beneath the Kuroshio Extension, the North West Pacific,"" published March 29, 2021 in Marine Pollution Bulletin, was authored by Ryota Nakajima, Masashi Tsuchiya, Akinori Yabuki, Shuhei Masuda, Tomo Kitahashi, Yuriko Nagano, Tetsuro Ikuta, Noriyuki Isobe, Heather Ritchie, Kazumasa Oguri, Satoshi Osafune, Koichi Iijima, Takao Yoshida, Sanae Chiba and Katsunori Fujikura, Japanese Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology; Haruhiko Nakata and Takuya Yamauchi, Kumamoto University; and Kiichiro Kawamura and Maki Suzukawa, Yamaguchi University.",772,4856,11,75

Japan and the US “discussed the free and open Indo-Pacific” and agreed “to promote the vision through concrete efforts” in cooperation with Australia, India and the 10-member ASEAN nations, Suga said at the news conference.

“We also had serious talks on China’s influence over the peace and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific and the world at large,” Suga said.

“We agreed to oppose any attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion in the East and South China Seas,” he said.

“At the same time, we agreed on the necessity for each of us to engage in frank dialogue with China and in so doing, to pursue stability of international relations while upholding universal values.”

Later, at an event hosted by Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, Suga said that Japan will say what is needed to be said to China and speak up on human rights, but also stressed the need to establish a stable, constructive relationship with Beijing.

“Japan’s basic policy on pending issues caused by China is to firmly assert what should be asserted and strongly request China to take specific action,” he said. “At the same time we must work to establish a stable and constructive relationship with China.”

Prior to the meeting White House officials had hoped to win a shift in rhetoric on China and Taiwan from Suga. US and Japanese leaders last referred to Taiwan in a joint statement in 1969, when Japan’s prime minister said maintenance of peace and security in the “Taiwan area” was important for its own security. That was before Tokyo normalised ties with Beijing.

The two sides “discussed the circumstances in Taiwan and Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region as well,” said Suga who refrained from detailing the talks but added that “there is already an agreed recognition over the importance of peace and stability of the Taiwan Straits between Japan and the United States, which was reaffirmed on this occasion”.

The US is seeking to send a “clear signal” that Beijing’s recent actions surrounding Taiwan are “antithetical to the mission of maintaining peace and stability”, a senior Biden administration official said Thursday. China has sent warplanes into Taiwan’s airspace in recent days.

Biden and Suga were set to announce a $2bn Japanese investment in 5G telecommunications to counter the growing technological might of China’s Huawei Technologies, and discuss Beijing’s treatment of Muslims in the Xinjiang region and its influence over Hong Kong, a Biden administration official said prior to the meeting.

‘A lot of these lines to carefully manage’

The visit is Suga’s first trip to the US as prime minister since taking office in September. Suga inherited a China policy that has sought to balance security concerns, particularly related to disputed islands in the East China Sea, with its deep economic ties to China and its close relationship with Washington.

There had been signs of a tentative shift in Japanese rhetoric in recent months, and more political leeway from Japan’s influential business class, Jonathan Berkshire Miller, a senior fellow at the Japan Institute of International Affairs, told Al Jazeera.

That included a statement following a March meeting of US-Japan defence and foreign ministers that named China directly – something Japan has not historically wanted to do – and decried Beijing’s “coercion and destabilising behaviour”.

In the March statement, the two sides had “underscored the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait” and shared “serious concerns” about human rights in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.

Still, “Japan has a lot of lines to carefully manage” during Friday’s meeting, Miller said, and Beijing will be watching.

China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian warned Washington and Tokyo to “avoid words and actions that interfere China’s internal affairs and harm China’s interests, and refrain from engaging in forming cliques against China”.

“China will make necessary responses as appropriate,” Zhao said, speaking to reporters on Friday.

‘Make sure they’re on the same page’

Miller said a main challenge for both Suga and Biden will be navigating a view of strategic competition with China that is “not completely congruent”.

“I think they need to kind of make sure they’re on the same page on these issues,” he said.

A US official who previewed the meeting on Thursday acknowledged that Washington and Tokyo have “slightly different perspectives” on China, saying the Biden administration would not “insist on Japan somehow signing on to every dimension of our approach”.

“We also recognise the deep economic and commercial ties between Japan and China and Prime Minister Suga wants to walk a careful course, and we respect that,” he added.

A Japanese foreign ministry official said last week it had not been decided whether there would be a joint statement on Taiwan sought by the White House.

Two Japanese governing party lawmakers familiar with the discussions told the Reuters news agency that officials had been divided about whether Suga should endorse a strong statement on Taiwan.

Quad

Friday’s White House meeting was intended to invigorate joint efforts between the US, Australia, India and Japan, an informal alliance known as the Quad, that the Biden administration views as a bulwark against China in the Indo-Pacific.

Other expected “deliverables” included a “broader, deeper set of engagements across technology, policy, health-related matters, climate, and also regional security,” the Biden administration official had said in advance of the meeting.",1029,6472,13,75

Moscow (AFP)

Jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny risks cardiac arrest ""any minute"" as his health has rapidly deteriorated, doctors warned Saturday, urging immediate access to Russia's most famous prisoner.

On March 31, President Vladimir Putin's most prominent opponent -- who was imprisoned in February -- went on hunger strike to demand proper medical treatment for back pain and numbness in his legs and hands.

Navalny is serving two and a half years on old embezzlement charges in a penal colony in the town of Pokrov around 100 kilometres (60 miles) east of Moscow.

Navalny's personal doctor Anastasia Vasilyeva and three more doctors, including a cardiologist, have asked prison officials to grant them immediate access.

Their letter to the head of Russia's Federal Prison Service was posted on Vasilyeva's Twitter account on Saturday.

A statement on her Twitter account said his potassium had reached ""critical levels"".

""This means both impaired renal function and that serious heart rhythm problems can happen any minute,"" it added.

Having blood potassium levels higher than 6.0 mmol (millimole) per litre usually requires immediate treatment. Navalny's were at 7.1, the statement said.

In the letter to the prisons chief, the doctors said Navalny, who was critically ill after a poisoning with the Novichok nerve agent, could suffer ""cardiac arrest"".

They said he had to be examined immediately ""taking into account the blood tests and his recent poisoning"".

More than 70 prominent international writers, artists and academics, including Jude Law, Vanessa Redgrave and Benedict Cumberbatch, have called on Putin to ensure that Navalny receives proper treatment immediately.

Their appeal was published late Friday by France's Le Monde newspaper.

Earlier this week, Navalny's wife Yulia, who visited him in the prison colony, said her husband now weighed 76 kilograms (168 pounds) -- down nine kilograms since starting his hunger strike.

On Friday, Russian prosecutors asked a court to designate Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation and the network of his regional offices as ""extremist"" in a move that would outlaw them in Russia and could result in jail time for their members.

The premise of the study was simple: some 1,500 participants were shown photos and asked to count the number of people in them.

The participants were able to take suggestions from a computer algorithm or the averages of guesses from their fellow humans in order to complete the task, which involved images of 15 to 5,000 people.

Also on rt.com Professor argues that MARIO KART could inspire fairer economic system

As the crowd size or complexity of the task increased, the participants, understandably, relied more and more on the algorithm to count the people. After all, computers are especially good at tedious tasks that humans shy away from, such as counting.

“It seems like there’s a bias towards leaning more heavily on algorithms as a task gets harder and that effect is stronger than the bias towards relying on advice from other people,” says management information systems PhD student Eric Bogert, from the University of Georgia.

The researchers concede that, in this particular task at least, there is no ambiguity in terms of the answer, only right or wrong, so the lack of nuance or perspective makes the task ideal for an algorithm as opposed to a human.

“This is a task that people perceive that a computer will be good at, even though it might be more subject to bias than counting objects,” says Aaron Schecter, an information systems researcher from the University of Georgia.

However, the researchers emphasized that our perception of how accurate an algorithm can be plays an important factor – outsourcing the task to a machine unwittingly affords the opportunity for bias and discrimination to creep in unbeknownst to the human participants.

Also on rt.com New Netflix doc ‘Coded Bias’ is so keen to show AI is racist that it ignores how tech tyranny is dehumanizing EVERYONE

“One of the common problems with AI is when it is used for awarding credit or approving someone for loans,” Schecter says.

“While that is a subjective decision, there are a lot of numbers in there – like income and credit score – so people feel like this is a good job for an algorithm. But we know that dependence leads to discriminatory practices in many cases because of social factors that aren't considered.”

Algorithms already largely dictate huge portions of human activity, with the stock market, social media, and online marketplace pricing among a myriad of tasks deemed too tedious for humans, but therein lies the potential for disaster, this latest research highlights.

HONOLULU (AP) — As muddy rainwater surged from Hawaii’s steep seaside mountains and inundated residential communities last month, the damage caused by flooding was obvious — houses were destroyed and businesses swamped, landslides covered highways and raging rivers and streams were clogged with debris.

But extreme rain events predicted to become more common with human-caused global warming not only wreak havoc on land — the runoff from these increasingly severe storms also threatens Hawaii’s coral reefs.

“These big events are the ones that have the greatest damage because they are the ones that put the most sediment and nutrients out onto the reef,” said C. Mark Eakin, senior coral advisor to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the former director of the agency’s Coral Reef Watch program.

A warmer climate tends to amplify existing weather patterns, said Hawaii’s state climatologist, Pao-Shin Chu, noting the islands have an overall wet climate and that powerful storms are expected to become more frequent.

“Given this climate change or global warming, as we have seen over the last hundred years, the atmospheric water vapor pressure is increasing,” said Chu. “We have some evidence showing that we already have some increasing, very intense rain.”

Coral reefs make up much of Hawaii’s nearshore ocean ecosystem and are critical to the state’s economy.

Hawaii’s reefs protect populated shorelines from massive ocean swells and storm surges from tropical storms — a benefit the U.S. Geological Survey valued at more than $860 million a year.

Adding tourism, fishing, cultural value and other factors, the state’s reefs are worth more than $33 billion , according to a NOAA-funded study.

March’s flooding was caused by a weather system that stalled over the islands and brought two weeks of rain, much extremely heavy.

On Oahu’s North Shore, “a very large flood wave” rushed down from the mountains and flooded the town of Haleiwa, said National Weather Service hydrologist Kevin Kodama.

“That’s a big challenge in Hawaii, where we have small, steep watersheds,” Kodama said. “Most of the basins in the state will produce flash flooding.”

Last month had 11 flash flood events and was the wettest March in 15 years, he said.

The runoff problem is multifaceted. Deforestation and grading on construction sites and farms lead to increased runoff. Feral animals such as goats, pigs and deer clear vegetation, causing erosion and excessive sedimentation on reefs. And constant, low-level runoff carries gasoline and oil from roadways, household chemicals, trash and pesticides into the ocean.

Any significant change in ocean conditions, such as an influx of fresh water alone, can harm coral health. Contaminants and soil from land accumulate on reefs and can smother and kill the coral. Scientists say suspension of material in the water can also block sunlight coral needs to survive.

One of the biggest problems for Hawaii reefs is sewage. There are about 88,000 cesspools throughout the islands, many in coastal areas.

“Cesspools are essentially a hole in the ground where there is no treatment prior to wastewater entering the environment,” said Jamison Gove, a research oceanographer with NOAA who lives on Oahu’s North Shore.

Cesspools leak into groundwater — and with heavy rains, they overflow and send pathogens and other harmful contaminants into the ocean.

In the town of Pupukea, where professional surfers compete at the famed Banzai Pipeline reef break, more than 330 million gallons (1.25 billion liters) of wastewater enters the ocean each year — enough to fill hundreds of Olympic size swimming pools.

On the North Shore during the recent flood, “brown, polluted water just blanketed the entire town,” Gove said. “You could just smell it everywhere.”

More than half the state’s cesspools are on the Big Island, home to some of the state’s most expansive and pristine coral reefs. And Gove said some areas have shown a clear decrease in coral cover where sewage routinely enters the ocean.

A reef off the town of Puako — an extensively monitored location — has seen significant losses, he said. Coral cover there has declined by about 70% since 1975.

“This is probably one of the more dramatic examples since coral cover is not this high in a lot of places,” he said. “But since we don’t have this type of data everywhere, we can’t say for sure this isn’t a more common story.”

NOAA is providing data on the issue to the state, and efforts to remove cesspools and change infrastructure to slow and distribute floodwater could help Hawaii’s reefs.

The state has banned cesspools in new construction and is attempting to remove the existing ones by 2050.

Although coral reefs worldwide face threats from global warming, including marine heatwaves that bleach and kill coral, storm runoff could prove a more serious and immediate threat to reefs in Hawaii.

“In Hawaii, I would rate runoff much higher than marine heatwaves in driving coral decline,” said Greg Asner, director of the Center for Global Discovery and Conservation Science at Arizona State University.

In 2019, Asner and his team used imaging technology on aircraft coupled with satellite data to create new detailed maps of all living coral in the Hawaiian Islands. The data, now being used by federal and state scientists, shows a correlation between land-based pollutants from runoff and coral health.

“More runoff impacts reefs, mostly by mobilizing more chemicals and sediment on land,” Asner said. “Increased chemical pollution and sedimentation is a major driver of coral decline.”

March’s floods were not the first of their kind.

A 2018 rainstorm on Kauai caused widespread flooding that cut off a community for weeks. The storm set a new U.S. record for rainfall in a single day with nearly 50 inches (127 centimeters).

Ku’ulei Rodgers, a coral reef ecologist at the University of Hawaii’s Institute of Marine Biology, studied that 2018 flood as well as a 2002 flood in the same area. The 2002 rains swept earth from a construction site into the sea and “killed almost an entire reef,” Rodgers said.

After the 2018 flood, a review found fish abundance on a nearby reef had been reduced by 20% and urchins, which help clean reefs and keep coral healthy, were reduced by 40%.

When making policy decisions about how to safeguard reefs, Rodgers said, it’s important to understand that land and oceans are intertwined.

″(Native) Hawaiians knew there was a connection between the two because whatever they did upland would affect their fishing downstream,” she said. “The better the watershed, the better the reef and vice versa.”

0,Escaped girls tell of insurgents’ mass abductions in Mozambique | Mozambique,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/17/escaped-girls-tell-of-insurgents-mass-abductions-in-mozambique,"Insurgents in Mozambique have abducted hundreds of women and girls, forcing many into sexual relations with fighters and possibly trafficking others elsewhere in Africa, interviews with some who have escaped the extremists reveal.

Most of the abducted women are under 18, with the youngest about 12 years old. They are being held in a series of camps and bases across insurgent-controlled territory in north-eastern Mozambique.

Many are chosen by young fighters as “wives” and forced into sexual relations. Conditions are extremely harsh, with limited medical care, long marches under guard, unreliable food supplies and a constant risk of attacks by government forces or mercenaries.

The mass abductions recall that of more than 200 female students from a school in the town of Chibok in Nigeria in 2014 by the Boko Haram group. Media attention, a Twitter campaign and interventions by celebrities led to the US and other western powers committing soldiers, intelligence specialists and substantial funds to the effort to rescue the young women.

The insurgency in Mozambique’s far north, which started four years ago, has killed thousands and displaced almost half a million people.

The interviews, conducted with 23 women last year by researchers from the Observatório do Meio Rural (Rural Environment Observatory), a Mozambique-based thinktank, offer an unprecedented glimpse inside an opaque and little-known group.

“This is the first time we have heard from people who have been inside,” said Joe Hanlon, an expert on Mozambique at the London School of Economics. The research also casts new light on the leadership of the insurgents, and appears to undermine claims by the US government and others that they have close ties with Islamic State.

João Feijó, author of a report based on the interviews, said that he believed more than 1,000 girls and young women had been abducted.

“These kinds of numbers would be a major logistic problem for the insurgents, and I believe that some girls have been trafficked. We have reports of women being selected to study English in neighbouring Tanzania, which sounds like a euphemism for being trafficked,” Feijó said.

“This report tell the story of those who ran away but doesn’t tell the story of those who are still there or who have been trafficked. Their voices are silent.”

The interviews reveal how only “young and attractive girls” are targeted by the insurgents. Those selected are known as “noodles”, a rare food seen as desirable, in contrast to “sorghum”, a staple, the women told researchers.

“Adolescent girls are the most favourite victims; other ages are spared,” one interviewee said.

In an attack last year on Mocímboa da Praia, a small coastal town still in the hands of insurgents, more than 300 women and girls were forced into trucks at gunpoint or marched from their homes.

One interviewee said that some people lost three to four children in the attack as the insurgents went “from house to house and captured the girls and took them away”.

Captive women are forced to attend “education” sessions of Qur’anic instruction and ideological lectures, according to the interviewees.

“They are given food, clothes and efforts are made to integrate them as ‘wives’. But this is not a choice. They are in a scenario of great violence and need food and security,” Feijó said.

A small number of women appear to have actively participated in military attacks, carrying weapons and choosing those who will be abducted.

The recent successes of the insurgents in Mozambique – whose organisation is known as both al-Shabaab and Ansar al-Sunna – have prompted global fears of a new extremist Islamist enclave in southern Africa.

Factions affiliated to Isis and to al-Qaida have grown in strength across the continent in recent years, one of the few regions of the world where both have expanded.

Interviewees said that many of the leaders of the extremists in Mozambique were local men, but there were some foreigners from elsewhere on the east African coast, particularly Tanzania. There were also reports of South African nationals, Somalis and others presumed to be from Arab countries in Africa or the Middle East.

They also described the training of abducted teenage boys in the use of machetes and firearms.

One remembered seeing a 14-year-old boy going on his first mission.

“We saw him, all happy, telling the fighters how he had killed people. He had killed them with one shot and then he had beheaded them,” she said.

The question of Isis links among the insurgents in Mozambique is controversial. The militants were acknowledged as an official affiliate of Isis last year and in March the US state department designated what it called the “Islamic State of Iraq and Syria – Mozambique” as a foreign terrorist organisation.

Some analysts attribute more effective tactics of insurgents in Mozambique to outside assistance. “In 2020, there was no doubt that they had international support … and there were many videos being shared where they were showing the Isis flag,” said Feijó.

Interviewees said the Isis flag was flown at insurgent bases and Isis claimed the group’s most recent attack on the port of Palma.

But others worry that the US designation may be counterproductive.

“I think the links are very loose. The affiliation is a kind of public relations effort on both sides … If you really make [the insurgency] Isis and global you highlight it for global jihadis and for Isis,” said Hanlon.",927,5687,11,76
0,What the Protests in Northern Ireland Could Mean for the Future of Its Peace,https://time.com/5955239/northern-ireland-protests-peace/,"In recent weeks, Molotov cocktails, bricks and bottles have met barricades and water cannons as towns and cities in Northern Ireland faced some of their worst rioting in years. Mobs made up mainly of teenagers from both loyalist and republican neighborhoods have clashed with police, who struggled to keep both sides apart at a “peace line” in Belfast.

The anger in Northern Ireland has many sources. Loyalists, who want to remain part of the U.K., want to know why, in a time of COVID restrictions, authorities pursued no prosecutions after crowds defied lockdown rules to gather for the recent funeral of a prominent member of the Irish Republican Army. A police crackdown on criminal gangs in loyalist neighborhoods has also pushed defiant young people into the streets.

But underneath all of this is the growing fear among loyalists that Brexit will increase the likelihood of Northern Ireland’s leaving the U.K. to reunify with the Irish Republic, a member of the E.U. The controversy of the moment centers on the question of borders. As part of Brexit negotiations with the E.U., U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson agreed to avoid reimposition of the land border that separates Ireland from Northern Ireland–and, therefore, the E.U. from Britain. Instead, the two sides agreed on the so-called Northern Ireland Protocol, which establishes a trade boundary in the Irish Sea.

There is still haggling to be done over the movement of food, animals and plants across that boundary to ensure that products leaving the U.K. meet E.U. legal, regulatory and health standards. There are also outstanding questions ranging from the future of steel and aluminum tariffs to the movement of pets across the border. The E.U. had argued that an alignment of standards on the manufacture of many products would mean fewer and faster border checks, but Johnson’s government is reluctant to make commitments that make it harder for the U.K. to sign future trade deals with other countries.

All of this leaves loyalists in Northern Ireland feeling pushed to the European side and fearful of a unified Ireland, while facing product shortages as new customs processes slow the movement of goods. This surge of anger comes as the governing and staunchly loyalist Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) preps for a serious electoral challenge next year. To fend off criticism that the DUP, supporters of Brexit, is responsible for Northern Ireland’s current predicament, its leaders have demanded that the protocol be scrapped entirely. If that’s not enough to blunt criticism of the party, a fragmentation of its voting bloc could leave the Northern Ireland Assembly in the hands of nationalists led by a Sinn Fein First Minister. That’s a nightmare scenario for loyalists and a serious challenge to the Good Friday Agreement, which brought peace 23 years ago.

How will Johnson respond? Many in the U.K. have moved in favor of Brexit in recent months, easing pressure on him for bold action, and Britain’s successful vaccine rollout should continue that trend. But Johnson can’t ignore Northern Ireland’s troubles, because they may become worse.

An end to the violence will require cooperation between loyalist and republican leaders, the British and Irish governments, and U.K. and E.U. negotiators charged with finding a way to ease the flow of trade to limit the risk to Ireland. Don’t expect quick progress. And there is no border fix that can ease tensions between those who hope for a unified Ireland and those who fear it.

0,Hope for men with advanced prostate cancer after Australian treatment trials,https://www.sbs.com.au/news/hope-for-men-with-advanced-prostate-cancer-after-australian-treatment-trials,"Bernard Lefers is from Nouméa, the capital of New Caledonia, and has prostate cancer. About 1.3 million men are diagnosed with the disease worldwide each year.

He is currently doing well after taking part in a trial at St Vincent’s Hospital Sydney, which is using a new class of treatment.

“I'm feeling good, very good. I can do everything I want,"" the 61-year-old said. ""I can go swimming, go hunting and go fishing.""

“The treatment is not hard. Chemotherapy is very difficult, a very hard treatment. It makes you very tired.”

SBS Sandra Fulloon

Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in Australian men. Estimates suggest that 16,741 Australian men will be diagnosed this year.

Bernard was one of 56 men who took part in the LuPIN trial, which uses two new drugs in combination. His doctor and trial supervisor, Professor Louise Emmett, says Bernard had a very good response to the drugs, with a marked reduction in tumours.

LISTEN New campaign supports men as prostate cancer leaves many suffering in silence

“This trial is part of a series using a new group of drugs which is offering real hope for men with prostate cancer,” she said.

“When Bernard first presented to us, he was very short of breath, very symptomatic with late-stage prostate cancer. With each treatment, his symptoms progressively improved.”

Bernard is a retired police officer and was first diagnosed in August 2015. The cancer later spread to his bones and lungs. His treatment in Australia was subsidised by a French government organisation.

“Bernard had already failed at least two lines of chemotherapy and all other available treatments. So this was really the last option left available to him,” Professor Emmett said.

But when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Bernard was forced to stop the trial and go home to Nouméa. His tumours later returned.

After being granted a medical exemption, he has now been able to return to Sydney for ongoing medical treatment that is unavailable in New Caledonia.

""I am determined to continue. It's not the end for me, I want to fight, you know?"" he said.

How does the new treatment work?

The LuPIN research is gaining international attention. It combines two drugs - Lutetium PSMA and Veyonda.

Lutetium PSMA is injected intravenously to deliver a small amount of radioactivity to tumours without adversely affecting healthy cells.

In a recent trial by the Australian and New Zealand Urogenital and Prostate Cancer Trials Group (ANZUP), and published in science journal the Lancet, Lutetium PSMA was found to have improved treatment responses, quality of life and pain control when compared with chemotherapy for Australian men with end-stage prostate cancer.

SBS Sandra Fulloon

The second drug, Veyonda, was developed by Australian doctor Graham Kelly, who was also diagnosed with prostate cancer.

He has formed an Australian clinical-stage drug development company, Noxopharm, to focus on the treatment of cancer and septic shock.

“We believe that Veyonda works by enhancing the body's ability to fight cancer, and what we're talking about now is the immune system,” the 75-year-old said.

SBS Sandra Fulloon

The final results of the St Vincent’s LuPIN combination drug trial will be published later this year, citing a response rate of 61 per cent.

“We are delighted with the early results from this most recent study,” Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia CEO Jeff Dunn said.

“There's some exciting research work being done in this country, in fact, world-leading research work in the treatment of prostate cancer.

“For those men living with more advanced disease, it really is a game-changer.”

Professor Emmett is campaigning to make Lutetium PSMA more widely available. At this time, a course costs $30,000.

Of the 56 men who started the trial, some have died. Bernard, and others, are still going strong.

“The last four years have been exceptional, very beautiful for me, and for my wife and all my family,” he said.

“Je voudrais merci. I would like to say thank you very much. Thank you very much.”

Those diagnosed with prostate cancer are advised to discuss treatment options with their doctor. For more information about prostate cancer visit prostate.org.au",711,4361,11,76

To address stigma, B.C. will officially request a federal exemption from Health Canada to decriminalize personal possession of drugs in the province to remove the shame that often prevents people from reaching out for life-saving help.

“Stigma drives people to hide their drug use, avoid health care and use alone,” said Sheila Malcolmson, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “Through provincewide decriminalization, we can reduce the fear and shame that keep people silent about their drug use, and support people to reach out for help, life-saving supports and treatment.”

Officials with the Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions and Health Canada have been working on an agreement that outlines how the Province of B.C. will work with Health Canada to apply for a provincewide exemption to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, which governs simple drug possession.

The overdose crisis has impacted every community in B.C., and a provincewide exemption must consider the circumstances unique to urban, rural and remote communities. Key issues for consideration are defining simple possession, determining allowable drug amounts and ensuring the readiness of law enforcement, health and social services to support decriminalization.

Consultation with Indigenous partners, peers, law enforcement, municipalities and public health officials is being planned.

Decriminalization is one additional tool in B.C.’s accelerated overdose response plan that also includes harm reduction, prevention, treatment and recovery, while building a system of mental health and substance use care.

As a signal of its commitment to the overdose response and what is to come in B.C.’s Budget 2021 and beyond, the Province is also boosting funds to secure recently expanded overdose prevention services for people at high risk of overdose provincewide.

A new $45-million investment over the next three years will extend and enhance the funding announced in August 2020 to support those services to save more lives.



“The COVID-19 pandemic is having devastating effects on people who use drugs – illicit substances are more toxic and people are struggling with increased isolation,” Malcolmson said. “Today, our government is committing to sustain and enhance services in every health authority to prevent overdose deaths and connect people to supports. There’s more to come as we continue building the comprehensive system of mental health and addictions care that British Columbians deserve.”

This investment will support people who use drugs by enabling health authorities to continue scaling up their regional overdose responses through new and expanded overdose prevention services, including inhalation sites to meet the growing need for this mode of consumption. Health authorities are hiring new registered nurses who can prescribe addictions treatment medications, in addition to social workers and peer support workers for new and existing interdisciplinary outreach teams.

The Province will continue to allocate funds to health authorities, which have the operational responsibility for planning and delivering services to meet the unique needs of the communities they serve.

There is much more to do to stem the tide of the overdose crisis; however, many people are getting the help they need now. Last year, nearly 3,000 overdoses were survived at overdose prevention services, with zero deaths recorded.

Expanding overdose prevention services and connecting people to treatment and supports is an integral part of A Pathway to Hope, B.C.’s roadmap for making mental health and addictions care better for people in British Columbia.

The funding is part of B.C.’s Budget 2021, which will work to continue to keep people safe and healthy now, while making investments in the critical services people rely on to support a strong recovery that includes all British Columbians.

Quick Facts:

Since 2018, more than 6,000 deaths have been averted because of the life-saving interventions government has implemented, such as expanded access to overdose prevention services including wide availability to naloxone.

Currently, more than 23,000 people are receiving some form of opioid agonist treatment in B.C. – more than at any other time.

To date, 82 registered nurses and registered psychiatric nurses have enrolled to complete their training to prescribe medications for opioid use disorder.

According to the BC Coroners Service, using drugs by inhalation has become the most common mode of consumption implicated in illicit drug toxicity deaths in B.C.

The Province is expanding access to addiction treatment and recovery services, including $36 million to double youth treatment beds and $13.5 million to increase adult beds throughout B.C. – with more to come.

Washington and NATO have been alarmed by the large build-up of Russian troops near Ukraine and in Crimea, the peninsula that Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014, and two U.S. warships are due to arrive in the Black Sea this week.

Russia — which said the U.S. naval move was an unfriendly provocation and warned Washington to stay far away from Crimea and its Black Sea coast — says the build-up is a three-week snap military drill to test combat readiness in response to what it calls threatening behavior from NATO. It has said the exercise is due to wrap up within two weeks.

Ahead of the arrival of the U.S. warships, the Russian navy on Wednesday began a drill in the Black Sea that rehearsed firing at surface and air targets. The drill came a day after NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called on Moscow to end its troop build-up.

In Ukraine, armed forces rehearsed repelling a tank and infantry attack near the border of Russian-annexed Crimea while its defense minister, Andrii Taran, told European parliamentarians in Brussels that Russia was preparing to potentially store nuclear weapons in Crimea.

Taran provided no evidence for his assertion but said Russia was massing 110,000 troops on Ukraine’s border in 56 battalion-sized tactical groups, citing Kyiv’s latest intelligence.

Clashes in eastern Ukraine

Fighting has increased in recent weeks in eastern Ukraine, where government forces have battled Russian-backed separatists in a seven-year conflict that Kyiv says has killed 14,000 people.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who held talks in Brussels with Stoltenberg ahead of a video conference of all 30 NATO allies, said the alliance would “address Russia’s aggressive actions in and around Ukraine”, without elaborating.

Russia’s relations with the United States slumped to a new post-Cold War low last month after U.S. President Joe Biden said he thought Vladimir Putin was a “killer”.

In a phone call with Putin on Tuesday, Biden proposed holding a summit between the estranged leaders to tackle a raft of issues, including reducing tensions over Ukraine.

The Kremlin on Wednesday said it was too early to talk about such a summit in tangible terms and that holding such a meeting was contingent on Washington’s future behaviour, in what looked like a thinly veiled reference to potential U.S. sanctions.

Russia has regularly accused NATO of destabilizing Europe by bolstering its troops in the Baltic countries and Poland – all members of the Atlantic alliance – in the wake of Moscow’s annexation of Crimea.

NATO has denied a claim by Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu that the alliance was deploying 40,000 troops and 15,000 pieces of military equipment near Russia’s borders, mainly in the Black Sea and the Baltic regions.

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and his Greek opposite number Nikos Dendias met in Ankara to in an effort to smooth over months of tensions between the two NATO allies.

The two were expected to iron out issues over maritime boundaries that brought the two countries to the brink of military confrontation last year.

The meeting began cordially, but the two men were soon openly quarreling after Dendias said violations of Greek sovereignty would be met by sanctions.

He said that Turkish warplanes had violated Greek airspace several times and warned Turkey not to spread ""fake news.""

Cavusoglu rejected his comments as ""unacceptable"" and accused him of exploiting the meeting for domestic purposes.

""You come out here, and try to accuse Turkey, to give a message to your country. It is not possible for me to accept this,"" Cavusoglu said in response to the remarks.

Greece and Turkey, both NATO alliance members, claim the right to drill for fossil fuels in the same parts of the sea. The two sides first sat down again for talks in January after a five-year hiatus.

Cavusoglu had told Turkish TV that the two men would discuss all disagreements, emphasizing the importance of maintaining an open dialogue.

The meeting was postponed from Wednesday after a last-minute NATO summit was called.

Greece gets support from the EU

Turkey's foray into disputed waters last summer triggered a heated response from Greece, with both sides commencing military maneuvers in the region.

Turkey ultimately backed down from its exploration after it was threatened with EU sanctions. EU allies also dispatched ships to the disputed area to back Greece's claims.

The two sides have also clashed over the island of Cyprus and the flow of refugees between the neighboring countries.

The EU decided to hold off on sanctions in the end and instead proposed the expansion of a customs union and refugee pact with Turkey.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and EU Council President Charles Michel visited Ankara last week to open talks and maintain positive relations, although this meeting produced its own small crisis.

Google's latest feature, Timelapse, is an eye opening, technical feat that provides visual evidence of how the Earth has changed due to climate change and human behavior. The tool takes the platform's static imagery and turns it into a dynamic 4D experience, allowing users to click through timelapses that highlight melting ice caps, receding glaciers, massive urban growth and wildfires' impact on agriculture.

To explore Timelapse in Google Earth, users can type any location into the search bar to see it in motion, whether it's a landmark or the neighborhood in which they grew up. Google said it removed elements such as clouds and shadows from the images, and computed a single pixel for every location on Earth for every year since 1984; ultimatel stitching them together into a timelapse video.

For example, it's possible to see the Cape Cod coast slowly shifting south, agriculture growth in the middle of a desert in Al Jowf, Saudi Arabia, and the development of Songdo beach, a man-made beach in Busan, South Korea.

0,Navalny camp plans protests across Russia on 21 April as health fears worsen,https://www.livemint.com/news/world/navalny-camp-plans-protests-across-russia-on-21-april-as-health-fears-worsen-11618748511342.html,"Jailed Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny’s condition has worsened sharply after a 2 1/2 week-long hunger strike, prompting supporters to say he could die in days and announce a nationwide protest.

“Alexey is dying now. Given his condition, it’s a matter of days,"" Navalny’s spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh said on Facebook. Navalny’s supporters called for demonstrations across Russia on April 21 in a blog post.

Anastasia Vasilieva, who heads the Alliance of Doctors union that is backed by Navalny and who is also his doctor, posted a copy of his blood-test results showing what she said were “critical"" levels of potassium. “This signifies kidney failure, which can lead at any time to a severe disruption to his heartbeat"" including the possibility of heart failure, she said on Twitter.

U.S. President Joe Biden was asked about Navalny’s condition on Saturday. “It’s totally, totally unfair,"" Biden told reporters in brief remarks. Navalny’s fate is in Putin’s hands, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Sunday.

Navalny, 44, has been held since March 11 at the notorious IK-2 prison camp about 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Moscow. President Vladimir Putin’s most outspoken critic was imprisoned for breaking parole rules while he was recovering in Germany from a near-fatal chemical poisoning in Siberia that he and Western governments blamed on the Kremlin. Russian authorities deny involvement.

After complaining of acute back and leg pain, Navalny began a hunger strike on March 31 to demand specialist care from doctors outside the prison system. In a post on his Instagram account Friday, Navalny’s allies reported that a prison official had warned him that a blood test indicated a “serious deterioration"" in his health and that he would be force-fed if he didn’t end the protest.

The Federal Penitentiary Service didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Officials have said previously that Navalny has received all necessary medical attention.

Biden pressed Putin in a phone call on Tuesday about the poisoning of the opposition leader, which U.S. intelligence has publicly blamed on Russia’s Federal Security Service. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron also quizzed Putin about Navalny in a March 30 phone call.

Dozens of public figures including five Nobel Literature Prize winners urged Putin in an open letter Friday to ensure that Navalny immediately receives medical treatment. So far, Russia has brushed aside all Western criticism of the case and Kremlin officials refuse even to mention Navalny by name.

Even as his condition deteriorates, Russian prosecutors stepped up a crackdown Friday by asking a Moscow court to declare Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation and his Moscow campaign headquarters to be extremist organizations. The opposition group warned that the designation could subject all of its staff and volunteers to criminal prosecution and imprisonment.

More than 457,000 people have pledged anonymously to take part in new demonstrations calling for his release, according to a tally on Navalny’s website. Organizers abandoned their goal of collecting half a million signatures to schedule a new protest, saying they could no longer wait.

The rally comes on the same day as Putin’s annual state-of-the-nation address to the Federal Assembly.

“Alexey Navalny’s life and the fate of Russia depend on how many people turn out on the streets this Wednesday,"" Navalny supporters wrote on his blog on Sunday. “We need three days to prepare for the rally so that everyone hears about it.""

(Updates with plans to hold protest before reaching goal of 500,000 signatures starting in first paragraph, French foreign minister in fourth paragraph.)

0,"Top official says asking China to do more on climate is ""not very realistic""",https://www.axios.com/china-climate-change-226c9e50-243e-44e6-a4bf-e1fb1522bb19.html,"China's Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Le Yucheng told AP on Friday that China is unlikely to pursue climate proposals beyond its current arsenal, calling it ""not very realistic"" for a country of 1.4 billion people.

Why it matters: Despite heightened geopolitical tensions, the Biden administration has emphasized the need to partner with China on climate change. Le's comments come as Biden's climate envoy John Kerry is discussing the issue in meetings with Chinese officials in Shanghai.

What they're saying: ""Some countries are asking China to do more on climate change. I am afraid this is not very realistic,"" Le told AP.

But China plans to send a ""positive message"" at President Biden's virtual climate change summit on April 22–23, Le added. He did not say whether Chinese President Xi Jinping plans to attend, but said, “the Chinese side is actively studying the matter.”

Le said that U.S. policy on China is ""too negative"" and needs to prioritize collaboration over competition. It can't be one ""side drawing up a laundry list or demands to the other side,"" he said.

The big picture: China is currently the world’s biggest emitter of planet-warming carbon dioxide, with the U.S. in the No. 2 spot — though the U.S. leads in historical emissions.

China aims to peak its emissions by 2030 and reach carbon neutrality by 2060, but the U.S. and other nations are pushing for them to set more stringent near-term targets.

These latest comments illustrate how much U.S. credibility on this issue was eroded when former President Trump withdrew from the Paris climate agreement, which the U.S. negotiated with the help of China.

What to watch: At next week's summit, the U.S. is expected to announce more ambitious targets for reducing carbon emissions and pledge aid for less wealthy nations' climate efforts, AP reports.",302,1835,14,76
0,"8 people killed after shooting at FedEx facility in Indianapolis, police say",https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/16/us/indianapolis-shooting-fedex-facility/index.html,"(CNN) Police arrived ""to a very chaotic scene, with victims and witnesses running everywhere"" at a FedEx Ground facility near Indianapolis' main airport late Thursday night, where a former employee shot and killed eight people and wounded several others, an Indianapolis police official told CNN.

Deputy Chief Craig McCartt on Friday afternoon identified the gunman as 19-year-old Brandon Hole, who was last employed by FedEx in 2020.

Hole was found dead of a gunshot wound that appeared to be self-inflicted, McCartt said.

In March 2020, Hole's mother told law enforcement that he might attempt ""suicide by cop,"" the FBI's Indianapolis office said in a statement.

Special Agent in Charge Paul Keenan said Hole was placed on an immediate mental health temporary hold by the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department. He also said a shotgun was seized at Hole's residence.

""Based on items observed in the suspect's bedroom at that time, he was interviewed by the FBI in April 2020,"" the statement said. ""No Racially Motivated Violent Extremism (RMVE) ideology was identified during the course of the assessment and no criminal violation was found. The shotgun was not returned to the suspect.""

McCartt told reporters that Indianapolis police found Hole's name in two past incident reports. The deputy chief didn't have information about the first report. The details he described from a 2020 report align with the FBI statement.

Investigators are trying to determine motive and were searching what they believe is the suspected gunman's home, Keenan told reporters late Friday morning.

When asked what brought the suspected gunman to the FedEx facility Thursday around 11 p.m., McCartt said: ""I wish we could answer that.""

On Friday evening, Indianapolis police released the names of the eight deceased victims. They are: Matthew R. Alexander, 32; Samaria Blackwell, 19; Amarjeet Johal, 66; Jaswinder Kaur, 64; Jaswinder Singh, 68; Amarjit Sekhon, 48; Karli Smith, 19; and John Weisert, 74.

A statement by IMPD said the next of kin has been notified by the Marion County Coroner's Office. The cause of death will be determined after autopsies are complete, according to the statement.

IMPD said the names of those injured are not being released.

The mass shooting is the country's deadliest since 10 people were killed March 22 at a grocery store in Boulder, Colorado

Thursday night's killings began when a gunman ""got out of his car, and pretty quickly started some random shooting outside the facility,"" McCartt said.

The gunman then ""went inside and did not get very far into the facility at all,"" while shooting others there, McCartt told CNN earlier Friday.

A crime lab technician works Friday in the parking lot of the site of the mass shooting at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis.

Laveda Chester told CNN's ""OutFront with Erin Burnett"" that she was arriving for her overnight shift when she heard one pop and thought it might be a car accident. She said she looked around and didn't see one. But then she saw the gunman running toward the building with a rifle in his hand.

She waited until he went in so she could drive away without drawing the gunman's attention. She went to another parking lot and called police. She said she then tried to warn other arriving workers that there was a shooting going on. Some stopped and some drove past her.

Two employees inside the building at the time heard as many as 10 gunshots, they told CNN affiliate WISH . The men left the building and watched as about 30 police cars responded, they said.

""Thank God for being here because I thought I was going to get shot,"" one of them, Jeremiah Miller, told WISH.

Investigators have heard the shooting lasted ""just a couple minutes -- that it did not last very long,"" McCartt said.

""My understanding is, by the time that officers entered ... the situation was over -- that the suspect took his life very shortly before officers entered the facility,"" McCartt told reporters.

There were at least 100 people in the facility when the shooting began, he said. Many were on their dinner break or changing shifts.

Four people were found dead outside and four others, not counting the shooter, were dead inside, McCartt said.

The incident marks at least the 45th mass shooting in the United States since the Atlanta-area spa shootings on March 16. CNN considers an incident to be a mass shooting if four or more people, excluding the gunman, are wounded or killed by gunfire.

President Joe Biden ordered flags at federal facilities to be lowered to half-staff and urged Congress to act on firearm legislation, calling gun violence an ""epidemic.""

An officer stands outside the FedEx facility in Indianapolis.

Several people wounded

McCartt said four survivors were taken to a hospital with gunshot wounds and a fifth person sought treatment in another county for a gunshot wound. Two people were treated at the scene, he said.

The gunman had at least one weapon, which investigators believe was a rifle, McCartt told reporters.

Police early Friday were trying to make sense of the crime scene while relatives of FedEx employees gathered at a nearby hotel, which officials offered as a place where they could await news, reunite with the workers and meet with police chaplains.

""Many of the employees did not have cell phones on them in the facility,"" and so many survivors were not immediately able to contact their families, McCartt told CNN.

Several people tearfully embraced as they reunited Friday morning at the hotel, video from CNN affiliate WISH showed.

When asked Friday morning whether witnesses indicated that FedEx or security personnel had any indication that something like Friday's shooting would happen, McCartt said no.

""We're still working with FedEx security for anything that might have been an indication this was going to happen right now,"" McCartt said at the Friday morning news conference.

'They didn't sound like gunshots at first'

FedEx worker Timothy Boillat and his coworker heard what they thought initially were ""two loud metal clangs"" when the shooting started, he told CNN affiliate WRTV

""They didn't sound like gunshots at first ... Then, we heard three more shots, and then my buddy ... saw someone running out of the building."" Boillat said.

""And then more shots went off. Somebody went behind their car to the trunk and got another gun,"" Boillat said, without saying whether that person was the shooter.

""And then I saw one body on the floor,"" Boillat told WRTV.

Police are asking anyone who was at the scene and may have left for safety or for medical treatment to contact them to provide information on the shooting.

Family members await information about their loved ones.

Governor and other officials offer condolences

Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett said the process of healing will be impacted in part by what conversations the nation has about cycles of violence ""driven by readily accessible guns.""

""We must guard against resignation or even despair -- the assumption that this is simply how it must be and that we might as well get used to it. We need the courage that compels courageous acts that push past weariness,"" Hogsett said.

FedEx released a statement saying it was ""deeply shocked and saddened by the loss of our team members.""

""Our most heartfelt sympathies are with all those affected by this senseless act of violence. The safety of our team members is our top priority, and we are fully cooperating with investigating authorities,"" FedEx said

Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb said Friday is ""another heartbreaking day and I'm shaken by the mass shooting at the FedEx Ground facility in Indianapolis.""

""In times like this, words like justice and sorrow fall short in response for those senselessly taken. Our thoughts are with the families, friends, coworkers and all those affected by this terrible situation,"" Holcomb said.

Flags will be lowered to half-staff from Friday until sunset Tuesday ""in remembrance of those we've lost,"" Holcomb said.

""Nothing we learn can heal the wounds of those who escaped with their lives, but who will now ... endure the memories of this horrific crime,"" Hogsett said.

US Rep. Andre Carson, whose district includes Indianapolis, tweeted that he was heartbroken by the mass shooting.

""I am communicating with local authorities to get all details of the attack and my office stands ready to help everyone affected any way we can,"" he said.

0,Belarus Lawmakers Approve Second Reading Of Draconian Bills To Limit Freedoms,https://www.rferl.org/a/belarus-lawmakers-approve-second-reading-of-draconian-bills-to-limit-freedoms/31207699.html,"MINSK -- Belarusian lawmakers have approved a second reading of several amendments to legislation severely restricting civil rights and the free flow of information amid a crackdown on the country’s pro-democracy movement.

The bills approved by members of the lower house on April 16 define a broad range of activities as “extremist,” providing additional ammunition for authorities to use draconian tactics to target and intimidate protesters and opposition forces challenging the official results of a presidential election last year that handed authoritarian ruler Alyaksandr Lukashenka his sixth consecutive term.

In the wake of the election, thousands of Belarusians have taken to the streets in what has become the largest and most-persistent show of opposition to Lukashenka. More than 33,000 people have been arrested in a crackdown that has left much of the opposition leadership in exile or prison. The European Union, the United States, and other nations have refused to recognize the declared election results and slapped sanctions on Lukashenka and other senior Belarusian officials.

The new amendments are likely to spark an outcry for further action.

According to the amendments, any activities by individuals, political parties, or domestic or international organizations defined as undermining independence, sovereignty, the constitutional order, and public safety will be considered as ""extremist.""

Crisis In Belarus Read our coverage as Belarusians continue to demand the resignation of Alyaksandr Lukashenka amid a brutal crackdown on protesters. The West refuses to recognize him as the country's legitimate leader after an August 9 election considered fraudulent.

If approved and signed into law, the amendments would ban lawyers from defending people in some criminal and administrative cases. Most of the lawyers who worked with the Belarusian Association of Journalists and have defended RFE/RL reporters in recent months have already been stripped of their licenses.

The proposed changes also say that the following actions will be considered as extremist activities: the distribution of false information; insulting an official; discrediting the state; impeding activities of the Central Election Commission and other state organs; and participating in or organizing unauthorized mass protests.

One passage of the amendments says that any materials promoting unsanctioned public events that can be read, sung, or shown will be considered as ""extremist symbols."" That includes portraits of anyone who was legally found to be an extremist.

In other parts, amendments to the law on media will allow authorities to shut down media outlets after they receive warnings if their activities pose a ""threat to the country's national security.""

The amendments also expand the ability of authorities to limit access to online publications if they carry information banned for distribution and refuse to follow requests by officials to address violations.

Lawmakers also approved in a second reading of amendments to the Criminal Code. Among other things, the changes would toughen punishment for disobeying, threatening, and assaulting law enforcement.

Another amendment would prohibit live coverage of unsanctioned protests, making journalists a target for attending such events.

Amendments to other existing laws dealing with extremism would give law enforcement officers the right to use firearms at their own discretion without waiting for a command from supervisors. Police would also be given the right to create lists of individuals they feel are inclined to participate in extremist activities.

Once on such a list, a person would be banned from some activities, including journalism, publishing, and teaching, while their financial activities would be put under surveillance. The amendments allow the central bank to monitor cash withdrawals through foreign-issued debit cards and limit such withdrawals, as well as to freeze the bank accounts of ""suspicious individuals.""

On the frontline in Ukraine's east, battle-weary soldiers are sceptical that US sanctions against Moscow and Kiev's appeal for NATO help will deter Russian strongman Vladimir Putin. Faced with the largest deployment of Russian troops on Ukraine's borders since 2014, President Volodymyr Zelensky has requested more tangible help from the West, but many Ukrainian troops say they know they are on their own.

""We should only count on ourselves,"" Taras Mykytsey, a 52-year-old soldier, told AFP in the frontline village of Zaytseve north of the separatist stronghold Donetsk.

The separatists, who have carved out two ""People's Republics"" in eastern Ukraine, are backed by Russia.

""While we are waiting for something to be sent to us, Putin will not wait,"" added Mykytsey, sporting a helmet and a bulletproof vest.

Yuriy, a 29-year-old senior sergeant based near the town of Shchastya in the neighbouring Lugansk region, struck a similar note, saying he did not expect Western boots on the ground any time soon.

""What foreign country would want to send its people to their death?"" he said.

Yuriy, who declined to give his last name, added that the Russian president would not buckle.

""Sanctions and negotiations can, of course, restrain Russia a little, but in general, these negotiations for Putin, it's like throwing sand against the wind,"" he said.

US President Joe Biden has pledged his ""unwavering support"" to Zelensky, and Washington this week hit Moscow with new sanctions over US election interference and other hostile activity.

After talks in Paris on Friday with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Ukranian leader called for a four-way summit with Putin and the resumption of a ceasefire upended by a recent spate of clashes between Kiev troops and the separatists.

'Ready for any scenario'

Under a grey spring sky, birdsong can be heard on the frontline but the tranquil spell cannot mask a spike in tensions and near daily clashes.

Around 30 Ukrainian troops have been killed since the start of the year, compared to 50 last year. Most of them were victims of sniper fire.

This week, ""a soldier was killed and two others from our battalion were wounded"" in an explosion, said 43-year-old Yuriy, speaking to AFP in the trenches near Zaytseve.

Yuriy, who also declined to give his last name, said the explosion was caused by a Russian-made landmine.

The Ukrainian military accuses Moscow of seeking to provoke a situation that would justify an armed operation.

""The enemy's task is to cause as many losses as possible and provoke return fire,"" Viktor Ganushchak, the deputy commander of Ukraine's military operation in the east, told AFP in the town of Avdiivka, some six kilometres (four miles) north of Donetsk.

Russia has denied sending weapons and soldiers across the border and says its troop movements do not pose a threat to anyone.

More than 13,000 people have been killed in a conflict which broke out after a popular uprising in Kiev ousted a Kremlin-backed president and Moscow moved to annex Crimea in 2014.

Some Ukrainian soldiers were hard-pressed to explain the Russian show of muscle, with others dismissing it as mere sabre-rattling.

""If it were an assault, it would be done more quietly without so much fuss,"" said Yuriy, the senior sergeant.

Mykytsey said Russia's plans were anyone's guess.

""Are they preparing for an assault or are these military exercises?"" he said.

""Our task is to prevent them from going any further. We have people and there are enough weapons.""

Over the past seven years, Ukraine has overhauled its army thanks to Western help, and Kiev's battle-hardened soldiers say they are ready for a repeat of Moscow's 2014 aggression.

""We are ready for any scenario,"" said Ganushchak. ""This is our land, we will defend it.""

Now picture 2.5 billion of them. That’s how many of the fierce dinosaur king probably roamed Earth over the course of a couple of million years, a new study finds.

Using calculations based on body size, sexual maturity and the creatures’ energy needs, a team at the University of California, Berkeley, figured out just how many T rex lived over 127,000 generations, according to a study in the journal Science on Thursday. It’s a first-of-its-kind number, but just an estimate with a margin of error that is the size of a T rex.

Given uncertainties in the creatures’ generation length, range and how long they roamed, the Berkeley team said the total population could be as little as 140 million or as much as 42 billion with 2.4 billion as the middle value.

“That’s a lot of jaws,” said the study’s lead author, Charles Marshall, director of the University of California Museum of Paleontology. “That’s a lot of teeth. That’s a lot of claws.”

The species roamed North America for about 1.2m to 3.6m years, meaning the T rex population density was small at any one moment. There would be about two in a place the size of the Washington DC, or 3,800 in California, the study said.

“Probably like a lot of people, I literally did a double-take to make sure that my eyes hadn’t deceived me when I first read that 2.5 billion T rexes have ever lived,” said Kristi Curry Rogers, a paleobiologist at Macalester College, who was not part of the study.

Marshall said the estimate would help scientists figure the preservation rate of T rex fossils and underscored how lucky the world was to know about them at all. About 100 or so T rex fossils have been found – 32 of them with enough material to figure they are adults. If there were 2.5 million T rex instead of 2.5 billion, we would probably have never known they existed, he said.

Marshall’s team calculated the population by using a general biology rule of thumb that says the bigger the animal, the less dense its population. Then they added estimates of how much energy the carnivorous T rex needed to stay alive – somewhere between a Komodo dragon and a lion. The more energy required, the less dense the population. They also factored in that the T rex reached sexual maturity somewhere around 14 to 17 years old and lived at most 28 years.

The science about the biggest land-living carnivores of all time was important, “but the truth, as I see it, is that this kind of thing is just very cool”, said James Farlow, a geology professor at Purdue University.",453,2559,14,77

For decades, Nepal’s endangered rhino population has dwindled to near extinction. But recently, thanks in part to travel restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic, the population has soared.

The nation’s count of endangered one-horned rhinoceros has increased by more than 100 over the past six years. Officials are hailing the rise a “conservation milestone.”

The rhino population across four national parks in the southern plains rose to 752 — up from 645 in 2015, according to the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation. That’s the highest it’s been in decades.

“The increase of rhinos is exciting news for us,” the department’s information officer, Haribhadra Acharya, said in a statement. “But we have challenges ahead to expand the habitat areas of this animal to maintain the growth.”

The area was once dominated by thousands of one-horned rhinos, but rampant poaching and habitat loss reduced their numbers. In the 1960s, there were only about 100 left.

Nepal has conducted a rhino census every five years since 1994 in an effort to conserve the species after it was listed as vulnerable. That year, the Himalayan nation recorded 466 rhinos.

Ever since, the government has stepped up its anti-poaching and conservation initiatives. But this year, the lack of tourists in the country left the habitats undisturbed, allowing for even more growth.

“Due to the COVID-19 lockdown, the tourist pressure was reduced drastically that resulted in the undisturbed habitat of rhinos,” Acharya told CBS News on Thursday. “In that scenario, the wildlife recovery might have taken momentum.”

Last month, hundreds of enumerators, soldiers and veterinarians worked for about three weeks to count this year’s rhino population. The census was delayed a year due to the pandemic.

They counted the rhinos using GPS equipment, binoculars and cameras — what they call a “direct observation method.” Officials said they got as close to 330 feet away from the animals.

The World Wildlife Fund, which helps fund and assist the census efforts, called the increase a “milestone” for the country.

“The overall growth in population size is indicative of ongoing protection and habitat management efforts by protected area authorities despite challenging contexts these past years,” the WWF’s Nepal representative, Ghana Gurung, said in a statement. “This achievement is yet another milestone in Nepal’s conservation journey showcasing the impact of concerted efforts of all stakeholders and providing much0needed impetus to the global conservation fraternity.”

Illegal poaching remains a massive threat to the rhino population due to the illegal trade of horns. Many countries prize the horns for their supposed medicinal properties, which are unproven.

Approximately 26 rhinos in Nepal died last year, including four from poaching, officials said.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List still lists the animal as vulnerable, with fewer than 2,200 left in India and Nepal. The species is already extinct in Bangladesh, Bhutan and Pakistan.

India’s capital New Delhi recorded 24,000 coronavirus cases in a 24-hour period and is facing an acute shortage of hospital beds, its chief minister said on Saturday, as the country overall recorded more than 200,000 cases for a third day.

""The situation is very critical, worrying. Oxygen is in short supply,"" said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, adding that almost one in four tests for the virus were giving a positive result.

""Beds equipped with oxygen supplies, and for critical care, are filling fast,"" he added.

New Delhi, which has imposed a weekend curfew, is among the worst hit cities in India, where a second major wave of coronavirus infections is straining health infrastructure.

In recent weeks, criticism has mounted over how the federal government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has handled the health crisis, as religious festivals and election rallies continue despite reports of shortages of hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and vaccination doses.

India reported 234,692 COVID-19 infections over the last 24 hours, taking the total number of cases to nearly 14.5 million, second only to the United States. Deaths from the disease rose by 1,341 to 175,649.

After imposing one of the world's strictest lockdowns for nearly three months last year, India’s government relaxed almost all curbs by the beginning of 2021, although many regions like New Delhi and state of Maharashtra have introduced localised restrictions.

""This is Narendra Modi’s biggest crisis yet. It is bigger than any security threat, external or internal, or even the economic attrition of 2020,"" political commentator Shekhar Gupta wrote in a column on Saturday.

VACCINATIONS, DRUG SUPPLIES

As complaints rise about slow vaccination rollout and shortages, Federal Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Saturday said 125 million doses have already been administered and 11.6 million doses would be made available in a week.

Some local governments - including in the New Delhi city - have raised concerns over shortages and hoarding of anti-viral drug Remdesivir. read more

Nawab Malik, a minister from Maharashtra, accused Modi's federal government on Twitter for restricting Remdesivir supplies to the state. A minister in Modi's cabinet, Mansukh Mandaviya, denied the allegation, saying adequate supplies were being arranged.

Mandaviya said on Twitter the government had intervened and prices of Remdesivir injections have been significantly reduced.

RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL, ELECTION RALLIES

After hundreds of thousands of ascetics and devout Hindus gathered for several days along the banks of the Ganges for a religious festival Kumbh Mela, Modi on Saturday called for restraint, saying on Twitter the festival should now be kept ""symbolic"".

Responding to Modi's appeal, one of the religious leaders Swami Avdheshanand urged devotees to not gather in large numbers. Devout Hindus believe bathing in the holy Ganges absolves people of sins, and during the Kumbh Mela, brings salvation from the cycle of life and death.

Those returning to Mumbai from the Kumbh Mela will have to quarantine, the city mayor said.

Experts have warned about the spread of more contagious variants of the disease, especially during large-scale gatherings for religious festivals and political rallies.

On Saturday, Modi was scheduled to hold two rallies in eastern state of West Bengal where state polls are ongoing. In recent weeks, such rallies have attracted thousands of people, few of whom follow COVID-19 safety protocols.

""Stop spreader rallies,"" the Times of India said in an editorial on Saturday, adding: ""Business as usual is an unaffordable luxury until this virus is conclusively tamed.""

Crack British troops are ready to head to Ukraine “within hours” amid fears of a Russian invasion.

Around 450 Paras are poised to drop into eastern Europe should the current crisis worsen.

The elite soldiers from 16 Air Assault Brigade conducted a practice jump last year as tensions began to rise, and they could be in the region within 36 hours.

A senior defence chief said: “It’s a waiting game, but all indications suggest Russia is days away from mounting an invasion.

“The Paras could deploy very quickly – this is what they are trained for and they are itching to get involved.”

Vladimir Putin has amassed more than 95,000 troops along Russia’s border with east Ukraine, which is under the control of Russia- backed rebels. Russian warships are heading to the Caspian Sea.

A five-nation alliance known as the Quint – the UK, US, Canada, Lithuania and Poland – is backing Ukraine and stated that it would “continue to call on Russia to de-escalate”.

The US has announced the deployment of two warships to the Black Sea in an attempt to shore up Ukrainian resistance to the Russians.

Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy flew into the contested Donbass region and spoke to troops entrenched there against potential military action from Russian-backed rebels.

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said our military had trained more than 20,000 Ukrainian troops, adding: “Our Armed Forces continue to support Ukraine.”

In Russia, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov warned the situation in eastern Ukraine was “very unstable” and made it clear that Russian army personnel were ready to step in to protect the interests of Russian-speaking residents of Ukraine.

A senior Japanese ruling party official said canceling this year’s Olympics in Tokyo remains an option if the coronavirus crisis becomes too dire, as a fourth wave of infections surges less than 100 days from the planned start of the Games.

“If it seems impossible to do it anymore, then we have to stop, decisively,” Toshihiro Nikai, secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party, said in comments to broadcaster TBS.

Cancellation is “of course” an option, Nikai said. “If the Olympics were to spread infection, then what are the Olympics for?” he added.

A key backer of Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, party heavyweight Nikai is known for his frank comments, which come as many other ruling party lawmakers have avoided discussing the hot button issue of a possible cancellation.

The world’s biggest sporting event has already been delayed by a year and is being held without international spectators.

Japan is grappling with rising coronavirus infections, with numbers trending higher in Tokyo after the government ended a state of emergency, and Osaka suffering a record number of cases.

The government is pushing ahead with preparations incorporating social distancing measures and other restrictions for the Games set to begin on July 23, with a scaled back torch relay underway.

“We’ll hold (the Games) in a way that’s feasible,” Taro Kono, a popular minister in charge of Japan’s vaccination drive, said on a separate TV program, according to Kyodo News. “That may be without spectators,” he added.

Little support

Polls indicate little support in Japan for holding the Games during a global pandemic. “Canceling Olympics” was trending on Twitter in Japan on Thursday with more than 35,000 tweets from users.

“If this person says it, Olympics cancellation looks like a reality,” tweeted @marumaru_clm in reference to Nikai.

Olympic organizers, Japan’s national Olympic committee and the Tokyo government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The comments from lawmakers come as health experts raise alarm at the spread of infection and strain it is placing on the medical system.

Japan’s top medical adviser, Shigeru Omi, acknowledged the pandemic had entered a fourth wave, driven by mutant strains, with Kyoto University professor Hiroshi Nishiura urging in a magazine commentary that the Olympics be postponed.

Akira Koike, an opposition lawmaker with the Japanese Communist Party, reacted to Nikai’s comments on Twitter saying holding the event is already “impossible” and a decision on cancellation should be made “quickly.”

Cancellation or postponing the Games would probably not hurt Japan’s economy much but would have a larger effect on Tokyo’s service sector, a senior International Monetary Fund official said on Wednesday.

LONDON — The head of the World Health Organization said Friday that an alarming rise in Covid cases has pushed global infections toward their highest level in the pandemic.

According to a proposed class action filed in B.C. Supreme Court last week, the North American operations for DHL's express courier delivery service have been requiring customers to pay extra fees to receive their parcels by making claims that are ""false, misleading and deceptive.""

Court documents claim that DHL leads customers to believe that fees they must pay once a parcel arrives from out of the country are government import and tax fees — when a large portion of them are actually going to DHL as a ""processing fee.""

""I don't think anybody has any difficulty paying for taxes and duty that's properly owing and payable,"" said the Vancouver lawyer behind the class action, Scott Stanley.

""It's when there's additional fees that aren't clear where people get their backs up.""

Got a story for Go Public? Contact Erica and the Go Public team

The lead plaintiff in the case is Gayle Vallance — a retired school teacher from Fernie, B.C. Court documents say Vallance ordered two books on fabric weaving from the U.K. in February — paying DHL $98 for shipping.

Nine days later, she was advised by DHL that her shipment had arrived in Canada, but she had to pay $33.16 in ""duties and taxes"" before it would be delivered.

""At all material times prior to payment, DHL represented to the Plaintiff that the fee being charged on her shipment was for duties and taxes,"" say court documents.

The claim says Vallance only learned ""after numerous inquiries to DHL"" that $17 of that fee went to the courier company as a processing fee.

Hidden fees?

At issue in the proposed class action is how transparent the company is about the fees it charges customers.

Court documents say that DHL usually sends an email to customers with the subject line ""IMPORT DUTY/TAX PAYMENT,"" advising them to pay up or risk losing their parcel.

The case says people paid the fees, believing them to be for duties and taxes. ""In reality,"" says the claim, the fees charged ""included a DHL processing or brokerage fee.""

""This was a hidden fee.""

Stanley says customers are ""already paying DHL to deliver these packages — they're not doing this for free. And this seems to be an extra charge that we say isn't clearly described for the consumer.""

The proposed lawsuit says DHL conducted an ""unlawful scheme"" that breaches a section of the federal Competition Act and ""constituted an unfair business practice contrary to consumer protection legislation"" across Canada.

""DHL was unjustly enriched by its conduct,"" says the civil claim.

Lead plaintiff Gayle Vallance alleges the 'duty and taxes' she was charged for a delivery was mostly a fee that went to DHL. (Submitted by Lindsay Vallance)

Go Public recently reported the story of a Calgary woman who — like Vallance — was surprised to learn that a chunk of the ""duty and taxes"" she believed she owed the government for importing a soccer jersey for her son was actually going to DHL as a processing fee.

After her story was published, Go Public heard from dozens of other customers who felt they, too, were misled by notifications from DHL that suggested all the additional fees — on top of the shipping already paid — were government charges.

According to the company's website, DHL is the biggest international courier company in the world, headquartered in Germany. With more than 380,000 employees, it serves more than 220 countries and territories and delivers almost 1.6 billion parcels a year.

DHL has yet to file a statement of defence, and the class action has not been certified — which determines whether it moves forward.

When contacted for a response, DHL spokesperson Daniel McGrath said the company does not comment ""on active legal matters."" When contacted about our previous Go Public story about alleged hidden fees, DHL spokesperson Hazel Valencia said information about the company's processing fee ""is available on the DHL website.""

Who is included in proposed class action?

Although filed in B.C., the proposed class action represents all residents of Canada who have paid DHL fees.

It seeks compensation for people who ""sustained loss and damage"" by paying DHL's processing or brokerage fees.

It also seeks payment for the ""stress and anxiety"" caused by spending time investigating the fees charged by DHL, communicating with DHL and reporting the company's ""unlawful conduct"" to the Better Business Bureau and other consumer protection organizations.

The proposed class action is similar to one filed on behalf of Ontario residents against United Parcel Service in 2007. It, too, centred on brokerage fees that were charged to customers — allegedly without their knowledge. The case was settled in 2018.",800,4820,12,77
0,"India Demands Rich Nations Like U.S. Clean Up Climate Mess, Signaling A Shift",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/india-climate-change_n_60678098c5b6832c7937008f,"A top Indian official erupted at a climate summit this week, demanding rich nations like the United States not only stop pumping planet-heating emissions into the atmosphere but start removing the cumulative pollution already fueling hotter temperatures, deadlier storms and flooding.

Broadcasting into Wednesday’s International Energy Agency-United Nations conference on reaching net-zero emissions, Indian energy minister Raj Kumar Singh rebuked developed countries for using up 80% of the world’s carbon budget. That, he said, leaves little room for billions across Africa, Asia and Latin America to follow the same path to prosperity.

Singh argued the answer is for richer countries to start outlining plans to clean up carbon dioxide, which accumulates and remains in the atmosphere for centuries.

“I believe that it’s important for all the developed countries to talk about, not net zero, but about removing more carbon from the atmosphere than they are adding — net negative is what they need to talk about,” Singh said. “And they need to tell us what they will do by 2030.”

The roughly 10-minute speech ― made to peers such as U.S. climate czar John Kerry, European Union climate minister Frans Timmermans, and Chinese energy chief Zhang Jianhua ― marked something of a turning point in climate politics. Developing countries whose emissions will determine the climate future have long pressed the U.S. and Europe, whose wealth traces back to colonizing swaths of Africa, Asia and the Americas, for more money and aid to slash emissions. But to date no high-ranking officials have demanded those rich countries clean up the carbon they spewed unchecked for over a century.

“A statement this direct about the need for negative emissions and addressing who might be responsible for it has not been made in a forum like this before by such a senior person,” said Michael Thompson, an expert in carbon removal policy at Carnegie Climate Governance Initiative who previously worked in New Delhi. “India’s comments in this setting may bring other countries, particularly developing countries, to the table.”

The Ever-Shrinking Carbon Budget

Global climate negotiations have largely centered on how to stop increasing the output of greenhouse gas pollution. With the exception of 2020, when pandemic-induced lockdowns halted factories and kept cars off the road, emissions have grown steadily over the past few decades and are set to rise again this year as economies reopen and countries scramble to make up for lost profits. Half of all emissions added to the atmosphere since industrialization kicked off in 1751 came after 1990, when governments understood the effects of global warming.

Hindustan Times via Getty Images Indian energy minister Raj Kumar Singh speaks in Patna, India.

The planet is already 1.1 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial averages. The 2015 Paris climate accord marked the first global agreement to slash emissions and to try to keep that temperature rise from exceeding 1.5 degrees, beyond which the effects on coastal cities, food systems and nature are forecast to be catastrophic.

In recent years, some countries have begun to make progress. The U.S., the world’s No. 2 source of emissions and historically the top emitter, elected President Joe Biden, who has started outlining plans to eliminate emissions from the power sector by 2035 and electrify the country’s 276 million automobiles. China, today’s top emitter, vowed to reach carbon neutrality by 2060, and over the past month intensified its domestic political mandates to peak emissions this decade. The European Union has made significant strides to green its post-pandemic spending, while the United Kingdom, fresh from exiting the bloc, is ramping up renewable energy and climate research.

“We should be wary about climate politics becoming too future-focused,” Aarti Gupta, a professor of global environmental governance at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, said in an email. “It’s too easy for the historically largest emitters to say: let’s not look back; let’s collectively look to the (far) future.”

Removing carbon dioxide is absolutely necessary. Even the most optimistic scenarios, where countries pursue aggressive renewable, electrification and energy efficiency goals, reduce air travel, and replace 80% of meat and eggs with cultivated alternatives, require at least 400 gigatons of carbon dioxide be removed from the atmosphere, according to a 2018 study in the journal Environmental Research Letters. The rate and volume of carbon removal needed to keep warming in check varies by model and is the subject of some debate among researchers. But most suggest the world should remove roughly 6 gigatons of CO2 per year by midcentury.

Technology Vs. Trees

There is fiery debate among advocates and researchers over how best to remove carbon from the atmosphere.

Trees are one popular method. Woody flora suck in prodigious amounts of carbon as part of photosynthesis, making forests what are generally known as “carbon sinks.” This, for example, is why preserving the Amazon rainforest or the northern boreal forest intact is widely considered such a vital and practical goal for staving off climate disaster. One 2019 study in the journal Science found planting new trees across an area the size of the United States could slash the CO2 in the atmosphere by a whopping 25%.

But that raises some big issues in practice. Between 2000 and 2014, foreign governments and corporations took control of some 500 million acres in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean as part of deals to conserve land to offset carbon emissions, and in doing so forced native peoples off their lands in what was dubbed “cultural genocide.” In 2014, the Journal of Rural Studies called the practice “carbon colonialism.”

The speed and direction of deployment of these technologies can’t be up to private industries, can’t be up to Chevron, and can’t be up to Exxon. We need public management and non-market control. Georgetown University political philosopher Olúfẹ́mi Táíwò

Government programs to pay private landowners to plant trees can provide perverse incentives to cash in by destroying existing forests, then planting new trees over them. Mexico’s scheme to pay farmers $213 per month to reforest over 1 million hectares of degraded land and grow more than 1 billion trees by the end of this year caused, by one estimate, the loss of nearly 73,000 hectares of forest coverage in 2019, according to a Bloomberg Green report.

Then there’s the issue of increased wildfires and the spread of tree-killing diseases and parasites, which could wipe out decades of carbon removal in one swoop.

Other forms of carbon removal, such as soil-management practices that are gaining traction with farmers, remain uncertain, despite holding other benefits for resiliency against extreme weather and the nutritional value of the food grown using them.

That has fueled growing calls for technological solutions to pull carbon from the air. The leading technology so far is called direct air capture, essentially giant vacuum fans that suck carbon from the air and magnetically attach it to calcium or potassium molecules, transforming the emissions into a substance that can be injected underground for permanent storage, to prevent its return to the atmosphere.

It’s a controversial gambit. The machines require huge amounts of electricity and could, if relied on to meet climate goals at scale, sap a full quarter of the world’s energy supply by the end of this century, according to a 2019 paper in the journal Nature Communications. Spending $1 trillion per year on the technology could help deploy it at scale and work out the kinks to make it cheaper and less energy intensive, a Nature study published in January found. But the Biden administration set aside just a fraction of that amount for all its climate efforts over the next eight years as part of its $2 trillion infrastructure package unveiled this week, meaning such a bid would be an extremely difficult political sell.

Carbon Engineering A rendering from the Canadian firm Carbon Engineering shows what one of its future direct air capture plants may look like.

The White House’s proposal included a call for Congress to amend the so-called 45Q tax credit that currently funds carbon capture projects to encourage more direct air capture investments. At the moment, that federal tax credit primarily benefits retrofits that catch CO2 at power plants and industrial factories and turn the gas into a substance that can either be stored or, as is more often the case, injected into nearly exhausted oil wells to obtain the dregs of crude. The price fetched selling that oil offsets the cost of capturing the CO2.

That, at present, does nothing to reverse the damage from climate change, but few other financial incentives exist for direct air capture. The two companies that currently produce the machines ― Carbon Engineering, based in Canada, and Climeworks, headquartered in Switzerland ― work with major polluters. Carbon Engineering took money from oil giant Occidental Petroleum. Climeworks struck a deal to supply the Coca-Cola Co., the world’s biggest source of plastic pollution, with CO2 for beverage carbonation.

“If we want to actually deploy carbon removal in a justice-oriented way, it can’t continue to be governed by the fossil fuel industry,” said Andrew Bergman, a doctoral student in applied physics at Harvard University who recently co-authored a primer on carbon removal science and policy.

Instead, said Georgetown University political philosopher Olúfẹ́mi Táíwò, the U.S. should set up a publicly run and managed carbon removal program as part of a much broader decarbonization effort, and include systems for local oversight.

“The speed and direction of deployment of these technologies can’t be up to private industries, can’t be up to Chevron, and can’t be up to Exxon,” Táíwò said, referring to the two largest U.S. oil companies. “We need public management and non-market control.”

Such efforts could, as University at Buffalo researcher Holly Jean Buck put it, “decolonize the atmosphere.”

Heated Geopolitics

It remains unclear whether Singh’s statement ultimately marks a fundamental shift on India’s climate negotiating position or a rift within Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration.

Despite building more solar, India was courting private investment to open 41 new coal mines as recently as last summer. Then, last fall, Singh himself announced plans to replace 29 coal plants scheduled to retire in the coming years entirely with renewables. But this Thursday, the government put out a notice delaying the deadline by which coal-fired plants need to adopt new emissions standards by three years.

“There is ZERO evidence thus far that India is taking meaningful actions to rethink its development trajectory, so that it can focus on poverty alleviation and human development needs of its poor, while trying to rein-in the emissions of the richest 10%,” said Prakash Kashwan, a political scientist and climate policy expert at the University of Connecticut. “On the contrary, the government’s actions on the environmental front seem driven by the present government’s intent to serve the crony capitalist regime that funds the obscenely expensive election campaigns of the ruling party.”

EMIDIO JOSINE via Getty Images Residents brave the floods in Mazive, southern Mozambique, on April 28, 2019, after a cyclone brought heavy rains.

Singh suggested India and other developing countries should not be forced to cut their emissions to zero.

In doing so, it could seek to position itself at the forefront of a new bloc of nations caught in what increasingly looks like a cold war between the U.S. and China. The world’s two largest national emitters and biggest economies joined together in 2014 in what was known as the Group of Two carbon superpowers to agree to cut emissions, setting the stage for the Paris agreement the next year. But so-called G-2 talks sidelined India, which, despite being the world’s third-largest emitter, has grown at a much slower pace than China and occupied a different role in foreign policy circles as a closer ally of the U.S.

Singh did not call out China by name in his speech. But he referred at one point to a 2060 net-zero target ― the deadline by which China agreed to zero out its emissions, a decade later than most countries in the West. That signaled he could be lumping China in alongside other developed countries and is seeking to place India as the largest and most powerful advocate for the rest of the world.

“The U.S.-China conflict is going to continue to intensify for years to come, and other countries, particularly in the Global South, are going to be under pressure from both sides to choose who they are with,” said Tobita Chow, an advocate for progressive U.S. engagement toward China and the director of the nonprofit Justice Is Global. “You’re going to have a set of countries trying to carve out a space that’s independent of that pressure to choose a side. Whether or not that’s what India is after right now is something to look out for.”

It’s a message that could appeal to countries like Mozambique, which generates relatively little income from fossil fuels yet suffered devastating back-to-back cyclones in 2019 that were widely seen as a glimpse of a brutal climate future. Nearly half of Mozambique’s population lives in poverty and less than 25% have access to electricity, according to U.N. statistics.

Countries across Africa, Singh said, “need to develop.”

“That development will require consumption of steel in huge quantities. That development will require consumption of cement in huge quantities. They also want to build skyscrapers. They also want a higher standard of living for their people,” he said, thrusting his hands in the air. “And you can’t stop it because you have already occupied so much carbon space.”

GENEVA, April 16 (Reuters) - The number of new COVID-19 cases per week has nearly doubled globally over the past two months, approaching the highest rate seen so far during the pandemic, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday.

""Cases and deaths are continuing to increase at worrying rates,"" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a briefing focused on Papua New Guinea (PNG) and the western Pacific region.

He said he was very worried about the potential for a much larger epidemic in PNG, and it was vital the country received more COVID-19 vaccines as soon as possible.

PNG has now reported more than 9,300 COVID-19 cases and 82 deaths. ""While these numbers are still smaller than other countries, the increase is sharp and WHO is very concerned about the potential for a much larger epidemic,"" Tedros said.

PNG health minister Jelta Wong said there was on ongoing challenge in the country to get people wearing masks and disbelief about the disease itself, which would complicate efforts to role out vaccines.

WHO officials said three emergency medical teams had arrived in PNG this week from Australia, the United States and Germany.

""The situation is extremely challenging right now,"" Takeshi Kasai, WHO regional director for the western Pacific, said of PNG. (Reporting by Stephanie Ulmer-Nebehay and Emma Farge. Editing by Mark Potter)

0,Top French court won’t prosecute Jewish woman’s killer because he was on weed,http://www.timesofisrael.com/top-french-court-wont-prosecute-jewish-womans-killer-because-he-was-on-weed,"France’s highest court on Wednesday found that the killer of a Jewish woman was not criminally responsible and could not go on trial, provoking anger from anti-racism groups who say the verdict puts Jews at risk.

Sarah Halimi, an Orthodox Jewish woman in her sixties, died in 2017 after being pushed out of the window of her Paris flat by neighbor Kobili Traore, who shouted “Allahu Akbar” (“God is great” in Arabic).

The verdict by the court means Traore will not face any trial.

In its decision Wednesday, the Court of Cassation’s Supreme Court of Appeals upheld rulings by lower tribunals that Traore cannot stand trial because he was too high on marijuana to be criminally responsible for his actions.

Traore, a heavy pot smoker, has been in psychiatric care since Halimi’s death. The court said he committed the killing after succumbing to a “delirious fit” and was thus not responsible for his actions.

Her killing stoked debate over a new strain of anti-Semitism among radicalized Muslim youths in predominantly immigrant neighborhoods.

French President Emmanuel Macron criticized the lower court’s insanity finding in January last year, drawing a sharp riposte from the country’s top magistrates, who invoked the separation of powers.

Macron said there was “a need for a trial” even if the judge decided there was no criminal responsibility.

The handling of Halimi’s slaying has been a watershed event for many French Jews, who say it underlines the French state’s failures in dealing with anti-Semitism.

“This is an additional drama that adds to this tragedy,” said the International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism (LICRA) after the ruling.

“From now on in our country, we can torture and kill Jews with complete impunity,” added the president of the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France (CRIF), Francis Kalifat.

The Simon Wiesenthal Centre’s director for international relations, Shimon Samuels, called the decision a “devastating blow,” which, he said, “potentially creates a precedent for all hate criminals to simply claim insanity or decide to smoke, snort or inject drugs or even get drunk before committing their crimes”

Following Wednesday’s verdict, lawyers representing Halimi’s family said they intend to refer the case to the European Court of Human Rights.

“It’s a bad message for French Jewish citizens,” said the lawyer for Halimi’s brother, Muriel Ouaknine Melki.

But Traore’s lawyer Patrice Spinosi said that while he could “obviously understand the victims’ frustration that there will not be a trial,” the law “in its current state” does not allow perpetrators to be tried in such circumstances.

An appeals court said Traore, now in his early 30s, had anti-Semitic bias and that the killing was partly connected to it. But it also accepted the defense claims that Traore was too high to be tried for his actions and he was placed at a psychiatric facility.

French Jews have been repeatedly targeted by jihadists in recent years, most notably in 2012, when an Islamist gunman shot dead three children and a teacher at a Jewish school in the southern city of Toulouse and in 2015 when a pro-Islamic State radical gunned down four people at a Jewish supermarket in Paris.",541,3334,13,77

'Security law could be used to target the press'

Chairman of the Journalists Association, Chris Yeung

The chairman of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, Chris Yeung, on Saturday said he’s extremely concerned that freedom of the press here could be further restrained, after Police Commissioner Chris Tang warned that the national security law could be used to tackle “fake news”.



The police chief has, for the second day in a row, accused a newspaper he didn't name of linking children who attended the police college open day on Thursday to ""black violence"".



Tang’s repeated criticism came after Apple Daily ran a side-story on its front page on Friday, saying children who attended the open day were given toy guns to play with, inside a mock-up of an MTR carriage.



A photo showing such a scene went viral on social media, and the newspaper noted that many people said it reminded them of the shocking violence meted out by police officers on people at Prince Edward MTR Station on August 31, 2019.



Addressing the media on Saturday, Tang again accused the newspaper of inciting hatred and dividing society, adding that while there are currently no laws to tackle the dissemination of “fake news”, the force can address the issue by considering whether those involved have breached the national security law or committed acts of incitement.



In response, the chairman of the Journalists Association said he’s very worried that the national security law would be “weaponised” to target the press.



Yeung said the police chief was wrong to accuse Apple Daily of spreading fake news, as the pro-democracy newspaper had published a genuine photo.



“This is not a fake photo. It’s a real photo. Being debated was about how the photo was being handled by the newspaper. But that’s a matter of judgement and different editorial treatment common in different media,” he said.



“If he [Chris Tang] thinks its fake [news], spell it out. Which part is fake?” he questioned.



Yeung added that it’s likely that the force may soon start to target media outlets or journalists for publishing news that it doesn’t like.



“Based on the commissioner’s logic, it might happen because he argued a photo could be divisive and could fuel hatred towards the police and that could fall into the national security law. That’s a very worrying example because the way different media handle pictures or their coverage is entirely based on their professional judgement,” he said.



“The case he was referring to, the way Apple Daily handled the picture, in fact could have happened to many media outlets… if his logic applies, it will affect almost everyone in the media.”



Yeung said the association has been demanding a proper dialogue with the government on various issues affecting press freedom, adding that discussions should be based on “facts and reason”.",480,2919,14,77

The advancing force includes 1,300 battle tanks, 3,700 drones, 1,300 artillery and mortar units and 380 multiple launch rocket systems, according to documents leaked to the Daily Mirror.

Tensions between the countries have been escalating following Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea territory in 2014, an attempt by Moscow to keep NATO away from its borders. Ukraine is not a member of NATO, but support for the organization has risen in recent years, and the country is allied with many NATO nations — including the U.S.

WHAT ARE THE IRAN NUCLEAR TALKS ABOUT?

Kiev has claimed 14,000 people have died in the ongoing conflict, and many fear that Russian President Vladimir Putin believes that the COVID-19 pandemic is the right time to attack and control large parts of the country, according to the report.

The appearance of painted stripes on Russian armored vehicles headed to the front lines reminded military experts of similar stripes on tanks used by the Soviet army during the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Mirror reports. The stripes are used as a deterrent to friendly fire.

The military exercise could also be seen as a challenge to the U.S., as President Biden is expected to impose sanctions against Russia for election interference, hacking and bounties on troops in Afghanistan.

The Biden administration has sent warships to the Black Sea to defend against the military buildup, and Russia has warned the U.S. to stand down.

European shares are expected to inch higher, with Euro Stoxx futures up 0.1% and Britain's FTSE futures slightly higher.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) was last up 0.25%, with Shanghai shares (.SSEC) adding 0.6%. Japan's Nikkei (.N225)ticked up 0.1%.

MSCI's broadest gauge of world stocks (.MIWD00000PUS) ticked up 0.05% by late Asian trade, staying just below Thursday's record peak.

""Markets look ahead to economic normalisation as vaccines will go around. Stock prices are likely to rise gradually while looking at upcoming earnings,"" said Tomo Kinoshita, global market strategist at Invesco Asset Management in Tokyo.

Markets in Asia were largely steady after China reported record 18.3% growth in the first quarter, though the reading slightly undershot expectations, while retail sales bounced strongly last month.

The data did little to change the view that its brisk expansion is expected to moderate later this year as the government turns its attention to reining in financial risks in overheating parts of the economy.

""Regulators might make further efforts to cool down the property market and control domestic leverage. Fiscal discipline might also be strengthened, leading to deceleration in local government financing and infrastructure investment,"" said Chaoping Zhu, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management in Shanghai.

Data from the U.S. overnight was also upbeat, with retail sales rebounding 9.8% in March, pushing the level of sales 17.1% above its pre-pandemic level to a record high.

The brightening economic prospects were underscored by other data, including first-time claims for unemployment benefits tumbling last week to the lowest level since March 2020.

""The U.S. recovery looks really strong. And now that restaurants and hotels, both of which are labour intensive, are reopening, we could see sharp gains in payrolls in coming month,"" said Koichi Fujishiro, senior economist at Dai-ichi Life Research.

Despite strong data, U.S. bond yields dropped, in part driven by Japanese buying, as they have began a new financial year this month.

The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield dropped to 1.529%, a five-week low, on Thursday and last stood at 1.578% , off its 14-month high of 1.776% set at the end of March.

""The market has already fully priced in an U.S. economic recovery in the near term. And if the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates on hold for the next two to three years, no doubt the carry of U.S. bonds would be very attractive compared with Japanese or euro zone bonds,"" said Chotaro Morita, chief fixed income strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities.

The fall in long-term bond yields benefited stocks, and particularly tech shares, given the idea that their historically expensive valuations can be justified because investors would have no choice but to buy shares to make up for low returns from bonds.

On Wall Street, the S&P 500 (.SPX) advanced 1.11% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 1.31%, nearing its record peak set in February.

In the currency market, lower U.S. yields were a drag on the U.S. dollar.

The euro stood at $1.1951 , having hit a six-week high of $1.19935 overnight while the U.S. currency slipped to a three-week low of 108.61 yen and last traded at 108.89.

Gold also hit a seven-week high of $1,769 per ounce and last stood at $1,765.50.

Oil prices hit one-month highs on higher demand forecasts from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and OPEC, in addition to positive U.S. and Chinese data.

Brent futures gained 0.6% at $67.37 per barrel, while U.S. crude rose 0.55% to 63.81 per barrel, both on course for their first substantial weekly gains in six.

REUTERS/Sebastian Castaneda/File Photo

Former Peruvian president Martín Vizcarra has been banned from holding public office for 10 years in a unanimous vote by the country’s congress after he allegedly jumped the queue to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

Vizcarra was found guilty of influence peddling, collusion and making false declarations in relation to Peru's VIP Vaccines scandal which saw scores of ministers and public officials receive Sinopharm vaccines before they were publicly available in the country. read more

Congress approved his temporary banning from public office by 86 votes in favour and zero against.

It also disqualified the former Health Minister Pilar Mazzetti from holding public office for eight years; and former Foreign Minister Elizabeth Astete for a year.

Both former ministers received the vaccine and resigned during the subsequent scandal. However, all three have denied having used their positions to obtain early access to vaccines.

Vizcarra said in February he and his wife were inoculated in October of the previous year as volunteers for the Sinopharm (1099.HK) trial in Peru - a claim the university hosting the trial denied.

The former president came to office in March 2018 on a promise to curb endemic corruption in public office and ran the country until being impeached by Congress in November last year on separate corruption charges, which he continues to deny.

He had been due to take up a seat in Congress following elections in Peru at the weekend, having obtained the highest number of votes cast for any legislator.

Sinopharm’s clinical trials in Peru took place between September and the end of 2020 with about 12,000 volunteers. In addition, local managers of the trial received 3,200 additional doses intended for personnel related to the research, host university Cayetano Heredia said.

His lawyers and relatives have been fighting ever since to have him repatriated to France. They have now decided now to publicise his case to put pressure on the French government.

""I pray and cry every day for a miracle. I can't imagine staying here for the full 16 years and eight months,” Azoulay wrote in letters sent to his family from Giresun prison in northeast Turkey, and seen by FRANCE 24.

Already incarcerated for almost four years for ""importing a banned narcotic product"", Azoulay, 43, has asked the French state to repatriate him so he can serve out the rest of his sentence in his own country.

Azoulay, who is gay and Jewish, says he is being harassed, mistreated and threatened on a daily basis.

Carole-Olivia Montenot, one of Azoulay's lawyers, describes feeling a sense of impotence as she hears of the horrors experienced by her client. ""It is terrible. He is being intimidated, his fellow inmates are telling him to convert to Islam and to pray five times a day. He is also being harassed because of his sexual orientation,"" she told FRANCE 24.

""His conditions of detention are an attack on human dignity,"" said Sophie Wiesenfeld, founder of the think-tank Hexagon Society and president of the Fabien Azoulay Support Committee.

""There are so many of us here living in such a small space. To go to the toilet at night, we have to walk on top of people who are sleeping. When they are woken up, they get angry and there are fights,"" Azoulay wrote in a letter sent to a relative.

Drug recently banned in Turkey

When he flew to Turkey nearly four years ago, Azoulay never imagined that he would end up in a Turkish prison. During a trip to Istanbul to get hair implants, he bought GBL (Gamma-Butyrolactone), a synthetic drug popular in party circles. He paid $300 via a Lithuanian website and arranged to have it delivered to his hotel.

""The product had been banned in Turkey just a few months earlier. But the website had not updated the list of countries that had banned it. Azoulay was therefore unaware that this product had been classified as an illegal narcotic in Turkey,"" Montenot explained.

Turkish customs intercepted the package and tracked its path to Azoulay's hotel room, where they arrested him.

According to Montenot, the arrest was followed by ""a succession of small hearings that each lasted about five minutes"". Azoulay’s fate was decided on February 27, 2018, at the end of an ""accelerated trial that lasted for about 15 minutes, including all the translations"", she said. The court sentenced the French national to 20 years in prison, later reduced to 16 years and eight months for good behaviour at an appeal hearing.

Despite his appeal and a legal petition, Turkish courts confirmed the initial verdict. Azoulay's sentence was finalised in January 2019. Five months later, his lawyers launched a repatriation request that would allow him to serve his sentence on French soil.

Azoulay was first incarcerated in a prison in Maltepe, a district of Istanbul. He believed it was necessary to hide his religious affiliation and explained in a letter sent to a friend that ""jihadists are trying to radicalise other prisoners"". In this overcrowded prison, he said he was subjected to forced prayers, physical violence and even witnessed a murder.

""One guy had his throat slit by a group of four Syrians. I was sleeping when it happened but the screams of the other prisoners woke me up. The sight of blood everywhere was frightening, worse than a horror movie. I later learned that the prisoner who died had made sexual advances on one of the Syrians and that, in the name of Allah, he had to pay with his life because of his homosexuality,"" he said in the letter.

'Collateral damage'

Although he tried to hide his sexual orientation from other inmates, Azoulay was the victim of a homophobic attack in November 2019. ""A fellow prisoner knew he was gay. In the middle of the night, he threw boiling water all over Fabien’s body, causing second-degree burns. Fabien had to be transferred to hospital,"" said Montenot.

Azoulay's lawyers reported this to France’s foreign ministry, which called an emergency meeting. The ministry proposed getting Azoulay transferred to another prison in Turkey. His legal team refused and reiterated their demands for his repatriation.

Azoulay was nevertheless sent to the prison where he is currently being held, 800 km from Istanbul. ""He is even more isolated there than he was in Istanbul,” says Wiesenfeld. “His family can no longer visit him because the area is surrounded by jihadists and it’s dangerous.”

Letters and a brief weekly telephone conversation with his brother are the only means of communication he has with his family.

The repatriation process remains at an impasse. ""The request for Fabien Azoulay's transfer, which was made officially in November 2019, has not seen any progress for almost two years,"" his lawyers said in a statement dated April 8. ""We are aware that dealings between France and Turkey are strained, but it is not acceptable that Fabien Azoulay should bear the brunt of this.”

""Fabien is collateral damage of the misunderstandings between France and Turkey,” says Wiesenfeld.

Relations reached new lows in October 2020, when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan controversially said that France’s President Emmanuel Macron needed to “have a mental check”. France had also drawn the wrath of Turkey for its military involvement in the eastern Mediterranean, an area that is the subject of Greek-Turkish tensions.

A détente seemed possible after a telephone conversation at the beginning of March between Macron and Erdogan. However, a new row erupted in France at the end of March over plans to build a mosque in Strasbourg.

In this tense diplomatic context, his lawyers and the Hexagon Society are struggling in their fight for Azoulay. ""We sent letters to the foreign affairs ministry, to the Turkish ambassador to France and to the French ambassador to Turkey. Their replies made us believe that the ministry would like to act but that it cannot, that it has to wait for the green light from the Élysée presidential palace.""

Contacted by FRANCE 24 on Monday, a diplomatic source indicated that ""the foreign ministry in Paris and our embassy in Turkey are fully mobilised regarding Mr. Azoulay’s situation"".

""Our consular services are in regular contact with Mr. Azoulay as well as with the Turkish authorities to inquire about his situation and the progress of his request for a transfer to France. In Paris, the services of this ministry are in regular contact with the family and lawyers of our compatriot.""

For their part, Azoulay’s lawyers sent a letter to Macron that has so far gone unanswered, Montenot says.

‘He wants to commit suicide’

On Saturday, a support group for Azoulay launched a petition to alert the public. By Tuesday morning it had already collected more than 77,000 signatures, including those of high-profile French personalities such as writer and economist Jacques Attali, Paris Deputy Mayor Audrey Pulvar and writer Pascal Bruckner.

But Azoulay's ordeal continues. ""His brother is trying to help Fabien as best he can. If he told him the true extent of the French government’s inertia, I don’t think Fabien would survive,"" says Montenot.

""Fabien has told his family that he will not make it through this, his fourth year in prison. He has fallen into a major depression. He is on medication and wants to commit suicide. He fears for his life.""

The boy, accompanied by his mother, was flown to a hospital from Fraser Island off the eastern coast and is in stable condition.

The dingo is a protected species on Fraser Island and are a popular attraction for camping tourists. The island's dingo population is estimated to be around 200, with packs of up to 30 roaming the island, according to the Queensland Department of Environment and Science.

In 1980 baby Azaria Chamberlain disappeared from a tent in a camping ground in Australia's outback, with her mother claiming she was taken by a dingo. The baby's body was never found, creating a mystery that captivated Australians for years and was made into a book and a film with Meryl Streep and Sam Neill.

Azaria's mother Lindy was jailed for three years over her daughter's death before later being cleared. A court ruled in 2012 that a dingo killed Azaria.

Dingoes, introduced to Australia about 4,000 years ago, are protected in Queensland state's national parks, World Heritage areas, Aboriginal reserves, and the Australian Capital Territory. Elsewhere, they are a declared a pest species.

Thursday's increase was the highest daily number of new cases since the start of the pandemic and more than double the previous record in 2020.

There is no national stay-at-home order in India, but the western state of Maharashtra, which is home to India's financial capital Mumbai, instituted a lockdown on Wednesday that will last through May 1.

The state's chief minister ordered that only essential services such as public transport and grocery stores will be operational between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m., and people will not be permitted in public spaces without a valid reason.

Epidemiologist Giridhara Babu of the Public Health Foundation of India told NPR that newer variants of the virus are likely the cause for the surge in cases, adding that many of those infected in this second wave are asymptomatic.

""But when the surge occurs, even 5% to 10% will be a large number requiring hospitalizations,"" Babu said.

The surge in cases has placed a strain on India's hospital system, with a line of more than 100 ambulances seen waiting to transfer patients to a hospital in the city of Ahmedabad.

India's health ministry showed it has administered more than 110 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines since it began its inoculation push in January.

New modelling details show additional public health measures could bring that number down closer to 10,000, sources say, however those measures would have to be considerably more restrictive to curb the rate of infection.

The modelling also shows up to 1,800 patients in intensive care by the end of May, according to the sources.

Projections released by the province two weeks ago had forecast up to 12,000 new cases per day with around 800-1,000 people in ICU by the end of April.

The Ontario cabinet is also considering the following proposals, which have not yet been formally approved:

Closing all non-essential retail, no curbside pick-up or delivery.

Further restricting retail hours of operation.

Restricting curbside pick-up (only permit non-essential retail to deliver).

Shutting down non-essential construction, warehouses and manufacturing not related to health, food or automotive.

Prohibiting all outdoor gatherings for non-family members in the same household.

Tightening capacity of indoor events like places of worship, weddings and funerals.

Increasing fines, increase policing powers.

Sources say Premier Doug Ford asked Alberta Premier Jason Kenney to send health-care workers to Ontario to help. Alberta has not yet made any commitments, the sources say.

Sources with knowledge of the request tell CBC News that Ford also made a similar request to Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe.

CBC News has also learned Ontario will make a formal request to the federal government for more than 600 critical care staff to support the province's hospitals with ICU occupancy. The formal request has not happened yet.

""We have received Ontario's draft letter,"" said Mary-Liz Power, spokesperson for federal Public Safety Minister Bill Blair.

""We are currently in discussions with the province to determine how best we can support them with more resources,"" she said, adding that the federal government is working closely with all provinces and territories to help support them amid the pandemic.

According to sources, the Ministry of Health has requested access to additional provincial money to tackle the third wave of the pandemic.

In a request that has not yet been formally approved, sources say the ministry is asking for up to $346 million for more health workers to support the creation of 1,000 incremental critical care beds in Ontario hospitals with high COVID-19 in-patient and ICU numbers.

The ministry is also looking at redeploying 1,000 staff from hospitals with lower COVID-19 patients and ICU occupancy to those with the highest ICU and in-patients.

This proposal has also not yet been formally approved.

""Premier Ford has said from the very beginning of this pandemic, that all options are on the table,"" Solicitor General Sylvia Jones said Thursday. ""And that continues to be our philosophy as a cabinet and a caucus.""

Jones, however, acknowledged the challenges a curfew would present in Ontario, pointing to the anti-curfew protests in Quebec.

""I think the Montreal riots speak to the challenge of both enforcing, and people's willingness to do a curfew,"" she said.

The Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA) said a curfew would not help the public health crisis, and urged the government not to go down that road.

""Imposing a curfew is an admission that the government has run out of ideas,"" said Cara Zwibel, director of fundamental freedoms at the CCLA. ""It is an unnecessary and disproportionate measure that is likely to do more harm than good.""

On Thursday night, sources with knowledge of the discussions told CBC News the cabinet has decided against imposing a curfew.

The cabinet is expected to resume meeting Friday to discuss imposing further measures.

All-time high

Ford's cabinet met Thursday as the province reported a record 4,736 new cases of COVID-19 and 29 more related deaths.

Meanwhile, the coronavirus has sent 1,932 people to the province's hospitals despite a stay-at-home order. There are 659 patients in intensive care and 419 on ventilators.

Hospitals have been ramping down non-essential and non-urgent medical procedures this week to ensure they have the capacity to care for COVID-19 patients.

The government said a COVID-19 field hospital could be opened in Toronto later this month.

The Ministry of Health said a mobile health unit at Sunnybrook Hospital, set up in the facility's parking lot, is expected to take patients in the coming weeks.

It is one of two field hospitals in the province designed to help address growing capacity challenges.

The province said the temporary beds will provide increased capacity to the health system as a whole by freeing up acute and critical care capacity within hospitals.

Variants surge in Grey-Bruce

The government said it will also help expand capacity by allowing the hospitals to transfer non-critical care patients to these general medicine beds.

Meanwhile, the Grey Bruce Health Unit told residents to stay home for the next two days as COVID-19 variants of concern surge in the region.

Public health authorities said all residents should consider themselves a COVID-19 carrier for the next 48 hours.

Authorities said the steps are necessary after 70 new cases were confirmed in the region in the past 36 hours.

The public health unit said it needs to slow the spread of the virus in order to do contact tracing.

It is also shutting down the Grey Bruce Health Unit info-line and cancelling a mass vaccination clinic on Saturday to redeploy staff to case management and contact tracing.

The province says 105,430 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine were administered since Wednesday's update, bringing the total number of vaccinations to 3,528,404.",929,5868,15,78

In a pioneering and controversial experiment, scientists successfully created just such a hybrid: a chimeric combination of monkey and human cells, existing together in a living embryo that otherwise would never have been conceived by nature alone.

Ethically fraught science? Yes. Mad science? No.

While research into human-animal hybrids has a long and questionable history, in recent years researchers have pursued chimeric organisms to probe questions of biology that stand to offer significant gains in fields such as regenerative medicine.

A chimera human-monkey blastocyst. (Weizhi Ji/Kunming University of Science and Technology)

For example, if we were somehow able to master growing human organs in pig tissue, it might go a long way to solving the huge organ shortage that costs human lives everyday.

To that end, a team led by gene expression expert Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte from the Salk Institute in California made headlines in 2017, creating the first pig-human hybrid embryo, with a view to one day being able to produce transplantable human organs from the animals.

As it happened, much like in similar experiments with sheep-human hybrids, the amount of successfully integrated human cells was very low, suggesting certain incompatibilities between the pig and human biology at a molecular level.

To try again with something a little closer to home, Izpisua Belmonte – together with a team led by primate reproduction biologist Weizhi Ji from the Kunming University of Science and Technology in China – conducted new experiments with macaque monkey (Macaca fascicularis) embryos, injecting them with human stem cells, to gauge how these distant-but-related animal cells might coexist as one.

In each of the monkey blastocysts studied, 25 human extended pluripotent stem cells (hEPSCs) were injected – a form of stem cell with the ability to contribute to both the embryo and the surrounding tissues that will support its development.

Using fluorescent tagging, the researchers were able to see that the human cells had successfully integrated in 132 of the macaque embryos, and after 10 days, 103 of the chimeric embryos were still alive and developing.

However, the survival rate began to diminish, and by day 19, only three chimeras were still alive, at which point all the hybrid embryos were terminated in line with the experimental parameters. The results overall showed a more successful integration than the pig-human chimera of 2017.

In addition, genetic sequencing of the blastocyst cells via a technique called transcriptome analysis revealed new clues about cellular communication inside the hybrids, which could greatly expand our understanding of how to make part-human chimeras succeed.

""From these analyses, several communication pathways that were either novel or strengthened in the chimeric cells were identified,"" Izpisua Belmonte says.

""Understanding which pathways are involved in chimeric cell communication will allow us to possibly enhance this communication and increase the efficiency of chimerism in a host species that's more evolutionarily distant to humans.""

Be that as it may, this kind of research makes many in the scientific community uneasy, meddling with both human life and concepts of animal welfare in ways that some consider either unethical or uncomfortably borderline.

While Izpisua Belmonte and his team emphasize that the research was conducted with the ""utmost attention to ethical considerations and by coordinating closely with regulatory agencies"", some have suggested these particular experiments may have been conducted in China to get around legal issues that might have prevented the work elsewhere.

""We are doing the experiments with monkeys in China because, in principle, they cannot be done here because of lack of infrastructure,"" one of the study authors, developmental biologist Estrella Núñez Delicado from Spain's Universidad Catolica San Antonio de Murcia told Spanish newspaper El Pais in 2019 when news of the study first broke.

In this case, all the embryos were destroyed within 20 days of their creation, but questions swirl around what would happen if such embryonic organisms were let to live longer, potentially developing the rudiments of a nervous system, or even aspects of consciousness or emotions.

Philosophical questions are not new in science, but such is the pace of development in research like this, that each successive advancement throws up fresh uncertainties and scientific possibilities that often haven't been considered before.

""New research often pushes up against the limits of existing thinking about ethics; this research is no exception,"" ethicists Henry T. Greely and Nita A. Farahan explain in a commentary published alongside the study.

""While human/non-human chimeras involving living or fetal animals have been discussed for nearly 20 years, little to no ethical discussion has focused on putting human cells into non-human blastocysts (let alone non-human primate blastocysts).""

The findings are reported in Cell.",791,5162,11,78

Police opened fire after about 2,000 of the protesters began hurling bricks and stones at officers at the construction site of the coal-fired plant in the southeastern city of Chittagong, local police official Azizul Islam told Reuters.

Four protesters died at the scene and another died in hospital, he said.

""We're trying to control the situation,"" Islam said, adding that at least six police officers were among those injured.

The workers attacked and set fire to several structures at the 1,320-megawatt power plant, located 265 km (165 miles) southeast of the capital, Dhaka, he added.

Local government official Saiduzzaman Chowdhury said the workers were protesting over unpaid wages and to press demands for a pay rise and reduced hours during the holy month of Ramadan, which started this week, when Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset.

Several of the injured workers had gunshot wounds and were taken to a hospital in Chittagong, he said, adding that the five people who were killed had all been shot.

The $2.4-billion power plant is a major source of foreign investment into Bangladesh, and one of a series of projects that Beijing is pushing to cultivate closer ties with Dhaka.

In 2016, China's SEPCOIII Electric Power Construction signed a deal with S Alam Group, a Bangladeshi conglomerate responsible for construction work at the site.

During that year, four protesters opposed to its construction were killed when police opened fire during clashes between villagers who were demonstrating both for and against the project.

The match was censored over “100 times,” according to My Stealthy Freedom, an Iranian rights group that opposes Iran’s compulsory hijab law.

During the Premier League match between Tottenham and Manchester United on Sunday, an Iranian state channel cut away from the game and played footage of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and the backstreets of North London in an effort to conceal shots of assistant referee Sian Massey-Ellis, who was wearing shorts.

Due to Teheran’s strict censorship laws, TV scenes deemed immoral or offensive are often censored, while films considered hostile to Islamic values are banned.

“Censorship is in the DNA of the Islamic Republic of Iran. We should not normalize this practice. This is not our culture. This is the ideology of a repressive regime,” the rights organization said in a statement on Facebook.

Since the Islamic Revolution of 1979, it became mandatory for women to wear a hijab and modest clothing in public, a move enforced by the Islamic religious police of Iran, known as Guidance Patrol.

Local programs must normally abide by strict rules in which no female hair can be shown, even in historical dramas or scenes set in a family home where real-life women do not cover their heads.

Iranian TV shows foreign films with unscarved women — although too much leg or cleavage gets blurred out or otherwise hidden.

Iran also has a contentious history with its female soccer fans.

In 2019, Iranian women were allowed into a Tehran stadium for the first time in decades to watch the 2022 World Cup qualifier between the Iranian national team and Cambodia at Tehran’s Azadi Stadium. This event marked a decades-long push by Iranian women to be able to watch matches, something hardliners in Iran’s Shiite theocracy still oppose.

Iran allocated 4,000 tickets for women in a stadium that seats about 80,000 people, keeping them separated from men and under the protection of female police officers. That’s even though face-painted Iranian women have cheered for their team abroad for years despite the 1981 ban that followed the country’s Islamic Revolution.",452,2777,13,78

An Auckland man has been charged with threatening to kill Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.

The 30-year-old, who has been granted interim name suppression, was arrested in Counties Manukau on Tuesday, police told the Herald.

The defendant did not attend his first appearance at the Manukau District Court today because he suffered an injury, his counsel told the courtroom.

He is also undergoing a mental health assessment.

He has been accused of a category three offence, which carries a maximum penalty of seven years in prison.

He has been remanded in custody without entering a plea until his next appearance on May 7.

He has also been charged with harassing a man online ""by sending constant social media messages having already sent messages between December 2020 and March 2021"", knowing that the harassment is likely to cause the man to ""reasonably fear for their safety"".

The Prime Minister's office declined to comment.

""As the matter is before the courts, police are not in a position to comment further,"" police said in a statement.

Threats made against Prime Minister

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has been subject to a number of threats during her two terms.

A man pleaded not guilty to a charge of sending threatening emails to Ardern between 2019 and 2020.

Police accused Michael Christopher Cruickshank of ""sending three emails having already sent 89 emails"" between October 17 last year and January 19 this year, a charging document viewed by the Herald reads.

The emails, the police allege, were intended to harass the Prime Minister and cause Ardern to ""fear for her safety (or) the safety of her family"".

Tel Aviv said the strike was a reprisal for a rocket fired into Israel earlier.

Reports of the bombing came shortly after 1am local time on Friday, with eyewitnesses sharing videos purportedly showing explosions and claiming F-16 fighters were attacking.

The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed the bombing and said it was in “response to the rocket fired from Gaza at Israel earlier tonight.”

Fighter jets and helicopters struck “a Hamas weapons manufacturing site, a weapon smuggling tunnel and a military post,” the IDF said on Twitter.

While Tel Aviv blamed the attack on Palestinian Islamic Jihad, one of the several militant groups operating out of the enclave, the reprisal was aimed at Hamas in line with the Israeli policy of holding that group responsible for anything that happens in Gaza.

Hamas – which stands for “Islamic Resistance Movement” – is a Palestinian faction headquartered in Gaza. It has de facto been the government of the enclave since Israel withdrew its troops from the 365-square-kilometer (141-square-mile) strip in 2005.

After dozens of missiles were fired from the strip into Israel in February, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu threatened Gaza with all-out war.

Gaza was occupied by Egypt during the war that followed Israel’s declaration of independence in 1948. It was captured by the Israelis in the 1967 war against Egypt, Syria and Jordan – along with the Jordanian-held West Bank and the Golan Heights region of Syria. The Sinai peninsula, also occupied during the so-called Six-Day War, was returned to Egypt in 1980.

Jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny is at increasing risk of kidney failure and his vision is deteriorating after more than two weeks on hunger strike, a medical trade union with ties to the opposition politician said on Saturday.

Navalny, 44, a prominent opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin, started refusing food on March 31 in protest at what he said was the refusal of prison authorities to treat him properly for acute back and leg pain.

""His condition is indeed critical,"" said Alexandra Zakharova, a representative of the Doctors Alliance trade union - a group that Russian authorities regard as opposition activists.

She cited tests obtained through Navalny's lawyers, saying members of the union had not examined him themselves.

""We have seen the tests, and they are very, very bad,"" she told Reuters.

""His potassium is high and he has other high readings which indicate that his kidneys may soon fail. This would lead to severe pathology and cardiac arrest may occur,"" she added.

Russia jailed Navalny for two-and-a-half years in February for parole violations he said were trumped up. He was arrested at the border as he returned to Russia from Germany where he had been recovering from a nerve agent poisoning.

About 80 famous writers, actors, historians, journalists and directors, including authors JK Rowling and Salman Rushdie, wrote an open letter to Putin on Friday, urging him to ensure Navalny gets the urgent medical care he needs.

Prison authorities say they have offered Navalny proper treatment, but that he has refused it and insists he should be treated by a doctor of his choice from outside the facility, a request they have declined.

Navalny said on Friday that prison authorities had threatened to put him in a straitjacket to force-feed him unless he abandons his hunger strike.

REUTERS/Tom Brenner

U.S. President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga will present a united front on Taiwan, China's most sensitive territorial issue, in a summit meeting on Friday, according to a senior U.S. administration official.

Biden and Suga are expected to agree on a joint statement on the Chinese-claimed but democratically ruled island at Biden's first in-person meeting with a foreign leader, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Biden and Suga will also discuss Beijing's treatment of Muslims in the Xinjiang region and its influence over Hong Kong, while announcing a $2 billion Japanese investment in 5G telecommunications to counter China's Huawei Technologies. (HWT.UL)

""You've seen a series of statements out of both the United States and Japan on the cross-strait circumstances on Taiwan, on our desire for the maintenance of peace and stability, on preserving the status quo, and I expect that you will see both a formal statement and consultations on these matters,"" the senior administration official told reporters.

The last time U.S and Japanese leaders referred to Taiwan in a joint statement was in 1969, when Japan's prime minister said maintenance of peace and security in the ""Taiwan area"" was important for its own security. That was before Tokyo normalized ties with Beijing.

The move now aims to ratchet up pressure on China. However, such a statement appears likely to fall short of what the United States has been hoping to see from Suga, who inherited a China policy that sought to balance security concerns with deep economic ties when he took over as premier last September.

In a statement after a March meeting of U.S.-Japan defense and foreign ministers, the two sides ""underscored the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait"" and shared ""serious concerns"" about human rights in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.

The U.S. official said the summit statement would follow on ""nicely"" from that, and that both countries, while not wanting to raise tensions or provoke China, sought to send a clear signal that Beijing's dispatch of warplanes into Taiwan's airspace was incompatible with peace and stability. read more

China's foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Friday that China has expressed solemn concern about what he called ""collusion"" between Japan and the United States, and the countries should take China's concerns seriously.

Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen told emissaries visiting at Biden's request on Thursday that the island would work with the United States to deter threats from Chinese military activities. read more

The visit was ""another concrete display showing the Taiwan-U.S. relationship really is rock solid"", Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said on Friday, after the delegation left.

China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control.

DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES

A Japanese foreign ministry official said this week it had not been decided whether there would be a joint statement, and two Japanese ruling party lawmakers familiar with the discussions said officials have been divided over whether Suga should endorse a strong statement on Taiwan.

The U.S. official said Washington expected ""each of our countries has slightly different perspectives"" and would not ""insist on Japan somehow signing on to every dimension of our approach.""

""We also recognize the deep economic and commercial ties between Japan and China and Prime Minister Suga wants to walk a careful course, and we respect that,"" he added.

With his first in-person summit with Suga and another planned with South Korea's leader in May, Biden is working to focus U.S. military and diplomatic resources to the Indo-Pacific and managing China’s rising global power, which Biden sees as the critical foreign policy issue of the era.

""The big issues that are playing out are playing out in the western Pacific, and Afghanistan was really receiving a disproportionate amount of time and focus and attention to the senior-most leadership,"" said the U.S. official, after Biden announced plans to withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan by Sept. 11.

UNITED QUAD

Biden hopes to energize joint efforts with Australia, India and Japan, known as the Quad, plus South Korea, to counter both China and a longtime foe, North Korea. Biden and Suga are expected to announce plans for the next Quad meeting on Friday, the official said.

Presenting a united front will require a delicate balancing act given Japan and South Korea's economic ties with China and the frosty relations between Seoul and Tokyo.

""It is concerning to us, even to the point of being painful, for us to see relations between Japan and South Korea fall to the current level,"" the U.S. official said.

""The political tensions are such that we believe it actually impedes all of our abilities to be effective in Northeast Asia, and I think the president will want to discuss this in some detail with Prime Minister Suga.""

Relations between Tokyo and Seoul have frayed over issues connected to Japan's 1910-45 colonization of Korea, including that of Korean women forced to work in Japanese wartime brothels.

Without any delays and directly in an open, direct discussion. It seems to me that would be interesting for the people of Russia and for the people of the United States.”

But the White House press secretary quickly rejected the invite, adding that Mr Biden has “no regrets” for his earlier remarks.

“We are confident that we can continue to look for ways where there’s a mutual interest,” said press secretary Jen Psaki. “​But the president is not going to hold back, clearly, when he has concerns, whether it is with words or actions.”

Earlier in an interview with ABC News, the US president was asked if he thought the Russian leader was “a killer”. Mr Biden responded: “Yes, I do”.

The comments drew sharp reaction from Russia as Mr Putin went on state television to flip Mr Biden’s comments. “We always see our own traits in other people and think they are like how we really are. And as a result, we assess [a person’s] activities and give assessments,” he said.

He further pointed at the US atomic bombing of Japan during the Second World War, as well as its history of slavery and slaughtering Native Americans, noting the painful legacies weighing on the United States.

“Otherwise, where would the Black Lives [Matter] movement come from?” he said, citing racial injustice and the killing of African Americans.

A Kremlin spokesperson also rebuked the remarks by the US President and suggested that such comments were without historical precedent. “It shows he definitely doesn’t want to build relations with our country,” said spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. “And things will flow from this.”

REUTERS/Ints Kalnins

There is a ""low to medium"" risk that Russia will invade Ukraine over the next few weeks, the top U.S. general in Europe said on Thursday, in the first such military assessment amid mounting concern about Russian troop movements toward Ukraine's borders.

Air Force General Tod Wolters declined to explain the intelligence driving his assessment, which does not suggest that the U.S. military expects a Russian invasion at this point, but he is not ruling one out or playing down the risk.

But, in testimony before a House of Representatives committee he later suggested his view about the risks in the coming weeks and months was at least partly based on the disposition of Russian forces.

The Pentagon has declined to detail its assessment on the size and composition of those troops, referring reporters to Moscow. However, the White House disclosed last week that Russia had more troops on Ukraine's eastern border than at any time since 2014, when it annexed Crimea and backed separatist territory seizures. read more

Asked by a lawmaker on the Armed Services Committee to estimate the chances of an invasion in the next few weeks, Wolters said: ""Low to medium.""

Pressed by another lawmaker to explain whether that risk would change after that period, Wolters kept his cards close, saying: ""The answer is, it depends.""

""And I would have to take each and every second of the day from this point till tomorrow to give you a different answer,"" said Wolters, who is both head of the U.S. military's European Command and is NATO's supreme allied commander Europe.

If the current trajectory stayed the same, however, Wolters estimated the risk of an invasion could decrease.

""My sense is, with the trend that I see right now, that the likelihood of an occurrence will start to wane,"" he told Congress members.

Ukraine and Russia have traded blame over a spike in violence in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian troops have battled Russian-backed separatist forces in a conflict that Kyiv says has killed 14,000 people since 2014.

Tensions over a buildup of Russian troops on Ukraine's eastern border have pushed up the cost of raising domestic debt and prompted the government to accelerate efforts to secure more International Monetary Fund loans, an adviser to Ukraine's president told Reuters on Thursday.

The United States sought to impose costs on Russia on Thursday by imposing a broad array of sanctions, including curbs to its sovereign debt market, to punish it for interfering in last year's U.S. presidential election, cyber-hacking, bullying Ukraine and other alleged ""malign"" actions. read more

Laura Cooper, deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, pointed to the sanctions and described the conflict in eastern Ukraine as ""a hot war right now.""

""Since January, we've already had 30 Ukrainian service members killed in the east,"" Cooper testified, speaking alongside Wolters.

Still, both Cooper and Walters did not request additional authorities to support Ukrainian forces, which started receiving anti-tank weapons and other weaponry in recent years from Washington.

""I think we have the right authorities and we have been able to provide the right lethal assistance, again, both on the land domain and the maritime domain at this point,"" Cooper said.

0,Brexit pushes 440 financial services firms to move some U.K. business to Europe,https://www.pionline.com/brexit/brexit-pushes-440-financial-services-firms-move-some-uk-business-europe,"Almost 450 U.K. financial services firms, including 92 investment managers, have relocated to other European cities or beefed up European presence due to the U.K.'s withdrawal from the European Union.

Money managers and insurance firms have also transferred more than £100 billion ($138.3 billion) in assets to Europe as a result of the U.K.'s withdrawal from the European Union.

Analysis by U.K. think tank New Financial found that, as of this month, 440 U.K. financial services firms have relocated to or increased resources in Europe, compared with 269 in a 2019 analysis.

Among the firms moving parts of their business to the EU were 65 money managers and 27 alternative investment firms. A comparative figure for 2019 was not available.

One-third of all money management firms that have relocated part of their business to Europe as a result of Brexit chose to move to Dublin, followed by 19 firms that moved to Luxembourg, 13 firms that moved to Paris, seven firms that moved to Frankfurt and five firms that moved to Amsterdam.

Among alternative investment firms moving to Europe, 10 relocated parts of the business to Luxembourg, nine chose Dublin, five chose Paris, two firms selected Frankfurt and one firm chose Amsterdam.

Firms have also been forced to secure European licenses in order to continue to service European clients from the U.K., amid a lack of agreement on financial services equivalence.

The shift in business, assets and legal entities will gradually chip away at the U.K.'s influence in the banking and finance industry in Europe and around the world, as a greater proportion of business is authorized by and conducted in the EU, New Financial said.

Across all financial services firms, 135 chose to relocate some of their business to Dublin, followed by 102 firms choosing Paris, 93 selecting Luxembourg, 62 opting for Frankfurt and 48 choosing Amsterdam.

Over the longer term, New Financial expects Frankfurt to lead relocation rankings by assets, while Paris will lead by the number of jobs moved. Details on the current rankings and breakdowns were not available.

The firm also identified £900 billion in bank assets, which constitutes around 10% of the entire U.K. banking system, that have been or are being moved out of the U.K. as a result of Brexit as of April. Bank assets that were estimated to have left or that were due to leave the U.K. stood at £800 billion in 2019.

The firm also said there have been 7,400 staff moves or local hires in response to Brexit, which New Financial expects to increase over the next few years.

However, the U.K. is still expected to attract smaller firms to its shores. New Financial expects between 300 and 500 smaller firms to set up a new U.K. office over the next few years.

0,Activists applaud government promise to shift away from animal toxicity testing,https://www.rcinet.ca/en/2021/04/16/animal-applauding-government-promise-to-shift-away-from-toxicity-testing/,"Animal rights activists are applauding a proposed overhaul of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, or CEPA, that includes a promise to shift away from toxicity tests on animals as well as increase government support for developing alternatives to animal testing.

“Amendments to the preamble of CEPA will recognize the need to reduce reliance on animal testing when assessing the risks that substances may pose on human health and the environment,” Environment and Climate Change Canada said in a statement published Tuesday.

“These amendments will encourage federal government departments to promote the development and timely use of alternative methods and strategies, as science permits.”

The changes follow a relentless lobbying campaign by animal activists and animal rights organizations, including Animal Justice, Humane Canada, and the Society for Humane Science.

“Countless animals are subjected to painful and unnecessary toxicity tests every year in Canada,” Kaitlyn Mitchell, staff lawyer with Animal Justice, said in a written statement.

“Animal Justice applauds the government’s commitment to reducing reliance on outdated and unreliable animal toxicity testing models.

“Canada should ultimately eliminate these painful experiments entirely, while supporting research into alternative models that are safer, more reliable, and cruelty-free.”

Activists say about 90,000 animals are used in toxicity tests annually.

And, they say, many of the tests fall into “Category E” the most severe category of harm that animals can experience, according to the Canadian Council on Animal Care.

“Category E tests cause death, severe pain, and extreme distress and may include procedures such as inflicting burns or trauma on unanesthetized animals, and forced ingestion or topical application of deadly substances,” Animal Justice said in a statement.

The groups are also calling on the federal government to fund the Canadian Centre for Alternatives to Animal Methods (CCAAM) at the University of Windsor.

“CCAAM is the first centre of its kind in Canada, dedicated to developing and validating animal-free research innovations such as cultured tissues, computer models, and organs-on-a-chip,” said Animal Justice.",324,2232,11,79

Media reports indicated the rocket landed in Israeli territory, but in an uninhabited area. There were no reports of injuries or damage.

The rocket triggered warning sirens in the southern Gaza border communities of Holit and Sde Avraham, hours after the start of Shabbat.

In response, Israeli aircraft hit a series of Hamas targets in Gaza, the IDF said. It also issued a video of some of the strikes.

Among the targets bombed included a Hamas training camp, an anti-aircraft position that was being constructed and a factory producing cement to be used in constructing attack tunnels.

The army said it holds Hamas responsible for all violence emanating from the Strip.

The launch came a day after a rocket fired by Gaza-based terrorists struck a field northeast of the Strip. In response, IDF aircraft struck targets linked to the Hamas terror group, which rules Gaza.

The targets included an armaments production facility, a tunnel for smuggling weaponry and a Hamas military post, according to the IDF.

The attacks came during a general lull in violence from the Gaza Strip in recent months, amid a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and as Gaza grapples with the coronavirus pandemic.

Iran’s nuclear chief Ali Akbar Salehi says Tehran has started 60 percent uranium enrichment at Natanz nuclear facility, days after an explosion at the site that Tehran blamed on Israel.

“We are now getting nine grams [almost a third of an ounce] per hour,” Ali Akbar Salehi of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran said on state television, after Tasnim news agency reported that production was under way at the Natanz nuclear facility.

Earlier, the speaker of Iran’s parliament said Iranian scientists had successfully started enriching 60 percent uranium at 12.40am (20:10 GMT on Thursday).

The comment by Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, quoted by state television, did not elaborate on the amount Iran planned to enrich.

However, it is likely to raise tensions even as Iran negotiates with world powers in Vienna over a way to allow the US back into the agreement and lift the crushing economic sanctions it faces.

The announcement also marks a significant escalation after the sabotage that damaged centrifuges in an attack this past weekend.

While Israel has yet to claim it, the country is widely suspected of having carried out the still-unexplained sabotage at Natanz, Iran’s main enrichment site.

“The will of the Iranian nation is a miracle-maker and it will defuse any conspiracy,” state television quoted Qalibaf as saying.

While 60 percent is higher than any level Iran previously enriched uranium, it is still lower than weapons-grade levels of 90 percent.

Iran had been enriching up to 20 percent – even that was a short technical step to weapons-grade. The deal limited Iran’s enrichment to 3.67 percent.

Reporting from Tehran, Al Jazeera’s Assed Baig said, “It is important to note that this is the highest level of enrichment that Iran has ever done.

“It seems to be in response to the incident at the main nuclear facility in Natanz.

“If we look at the 20 percent enrichment, that was in response to the assassination of the Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsin Fakhrizadeh in November,” explained Baig.

“Iran’s line is that it [the enrichment of uranium at 60 percent] is for medical use, but the EU has said there is no need for Iran to enrich to 60 percent. In reality, it could be as leverage in the nuclear talks in Vienna,” he added.

The move could inspire a further response from Israel amid a long-running shadow war between the nations.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged never to allow Tehran to obtain a nuclear weapon and his country has twice pre-emptively bombed Middle East nations to stop their atomic programmes.

Tehran has maintained that its nuclear programme is peaceful and it does not aim to build an atomic bomb.",464,2800,14,79

REUTERS/Amanda Perobelli/File Photo

A majority of Brazil's Supreme Court confirmed on Thursday a decision to annul criminal convictions against former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, teeing up a presidential run against current President Jair Bolsonaro in 2022.

The decision, which was widely expected, came after Supreme Court Justice Edson Fachin determined in early March that the lower federal court where Lula was tried lacked jurisdiction, a ruling that was quickly appealed by Brazil's top prosecutor. read more

Lula, 75, governed Latin America's biggest country and largest economy between 2003 and 2011, overseeing a commodities boom that turbocharged economic growth.

In 2018, he was convicted of taking bribes from engineering firms in return for public contracts and spent a year and a half behind bars, until the Supreme Court ruled he and others could appeal their cases without serving time.

Lula and his supporters blasted the anti-corruption task force that brought him down, called Operation Car Wash, as a politically driven effort. Leaked conversations in 2019 raised questions about whether investigators had cut corners to secure prosecutions. The task force was disbanded in February.

With the convictions tossed, Lula is eligible to run once again and is the odds-on favorite among Bolsonaro opponents to take on the right-wing leader in 2022. Early polls show a tight race.

Myanmar’s junta on Saturday announced it pardoned and released more than 23,000 prisoners to mark the traditional Thingyan New Year holiday, but it wasn’t immediately clear if they included pro-democracy activists who were detained in the wake of the military’s seizure of power in February.

Advertising Read more

The releases were announced on state broadcaster MRTV, which said that junta chief Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing had pardoned 23,047 prisoners, including 137 foreigners who will be deported from Myanmar. He also reduced sentences for others.

The move comes as daily protests against the Feb. 1 ouster of the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi continue, as does the use of deadly force against them.

According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which monitors casualties and arrests, government forces have killed at least 728 protesters and bystanders since the takeover. The group says 3,141 people, including Suu Kyi, are in detention.

Unconfirmed but credible accounts with photos on social media claimed that three people were killed Saturday by security forces in a violent crackdown in the central city of Mogok, in Myanmar’s gem mining region.

Detainees released Saturday from Yangon’s Insein Prison included at least three political prisoners who were jailed in 2019, said witnesses and local press reports.

The three are members of the Peacock Generation performance troupe where were arrested during that year's New Year celebrations for skits that poked fun at military representatives in Parliament and military involvement in business.

Their traditional style of acting is called Thangyat, a mash-up of poetry, comedy and music with a sharp undertone of satire. Several members of the troupe were convicted under a law banning circulation of information that could endanger or demoralize members of the military. The actors may have drawn the special wrath of the military because they performed in army uniforms.

Several members were also found guilty of online defamation for livestreaming their performances. It could not be ascertained if all imprisoned members of the troupe were released.

Another freed prisoner was Ross Dunkley, an Australian newspaper entrepreneur sentenced in 2019 to 13 years in a Myanmar prison for drug possession. His release was confirmed by his ex-wife Cynda Johnston, reported The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper.

Dunkley co-founded the The Myanmar Times, an English-language daily, but was forced to give up his share in it. He became well-known for co-founding or acquiring English-language publications in formerly socialist states that were seeking foreign investment as they liberalized their economies, but was sometimes criticized for doing business with authoritarian regimes.

Early prisoner releases are customary during major holidays, and this is the second batch the ruling junta has announced since taking power.

Following the release of more than 23,000 convicts to mark Union Day on Feb. 12, there were reports on social media that some were recruited by the authorities to carry out violence at night in residential areas to spread panic, especially by setting fires. Some areas responded by setting up their own neighborhood watch groups.

In March, more than 600 people who were imprisoned for demonstrating against the February coup were released from Insein Prison, a rare conciliatory gesture by the military that appeared aimed at placating the protest movement.

Those freed were mostly young people caught in sweeps of street demonstrations, while those considered protest leaders were kept locked up.

Neither the military government nor those opposed to it show any signs of backing off from their struggle for power. Western nations have tried to pressure the military through diplomatic and economic sanctions with little evident effect.

Myanmar’s Southeast Asian neighbors, concerned about the prospects for regional instability, are also trying to get the junta to start back on the path to restoring democracy, or at least end its violent repression.

A spokesman for Thailand’s Foreign Ministry in Bangkok said Saturday that junta chief Min Aung Hlaing has confirmed he will attend a summit meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations — ASEAN — expected to be held on April 24.

Tanee Sangrat said in a text message to journalists that Brunei, the current chair of the 10-nation body, confirmed it had proposed the date for a meeting at the group’s secretariat in the Indonesian capital Jakarta. Indonesia has taken the lead in calling for the special meeting to discuss the crisis in Myanmar.

0,British families took bigger hit to income during Covid pandemic than Europeans,https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2021/apr/18/british-families-took-bigger-hit-to-income-than-european-households,"British households were plunged into the Covid pandemic with lower savings, more debt and weaker welfare support than their French and German counterparts, according to analysis revealing how inequality increased the impact of the UK crisis.

High levels of income inequality also weakened the financial resilience of poorer households as the pandemic hit. The greater exposure of British households, revealed in an analysis by the Resolution Foundation thinktank to be published in full this week, comes despite similar levels of average income with our European neighbours.

The typical working-age income level in the UK is £29,437 and £29,350 in France. However, the poorest fifth of working-age households in the UK are 20% poorer than their French counterparts, while the richest fifth are 17% richer in Britain.

The structure of Britain’s economy and income inequality is seen by some as a reason for the heavy toll the pandemic had wrought on the UK. Some public health officials continue to warn that incidences of the virus remain higher in areas with many people in low-paid work and where they cannot work from home. There have been warnings that it could become a “disease of the poor” in some areas.

High employment levels in the UK helped household finances in the run-up to the pandemic last year, with a 75% employment rate – broadly similar to that in Germany and far higher than the 66% record in France. However, the typical hourly rate paid in the UK (£11.20) was much lower than in Germany (£12.33) and France (£13.89). It was partly driven by low self-employed earnings, raising further concerns about the extent of the gig economy in Britain.

Levels of UK welfare support were found to be poor in comparison with other large European nations, underlining the importance of protecting jobs through the government’s emergency furlough scheme rolled out last year. For example, a single adult who had been out of work for two months, having previously earned two-thirds of the average wage, would see their benefit income total just 17% of their previous earnings. The same person would see a benefit replacement rate of 59% in Germany and 64% in France. The gap is closed when housing-related benefits are included, with the UK’s benefit replacement rate rising to 46%, compared with 59% in Germany and 68% in France.

Household savings before the pandemic were lower in the UK than in France and Germany. Two-thirds of low-income households in Britain have savings that amount to less than one month’s disposable income. The figure in France and Germany is 56%.

However, average housing costs are higher in Germany than in France and the UK because of high levels of private renting, particularly for the low-paid. The precarious position of some households in Britain compared with their European counterparts came despite much higher housing wealth.

Overall, the study found that the combination of lower incomes at the bottom level of British earners, comparatively low levels of private savings, and a less generous social security safety net meant that UK households were “particularly exposed to economic shocks – such as the Covid-19 crisis that countries across the world have experienced over the past 12 months.”

Dan Tomlinson, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Typical household incomes across the UK, France and Germany are broadly similar. But their saving and spending patterns are quite different – and this means that UK households in particular have gone into the Covid-19 crisis with far less financial security than their European counterparts.”

He added: “High levels of inequality in the UK mean our low-income families are poorer, have fewer savings and are more likely to have financial debt. And although UK households have more housing wealth and are more likely to work than households in France, the level of support available if they lose their jobs is far weaker.",640,3942,12,79
0,Norway may allow U.S. military to build on its soil in revised cooperation deal,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/norway-may-allow-us-military-build-its-soil-revised-cooperation-deal-2021-04-16/,"Norway, which shares a short border with giant neighbour Russia, said on Friday it has signed a revised agreement with the United States on how to regulate U.S. military activity on its soil.

The agreement between the two NATO allies will let the U.S. build facilities at three Norwegian airfields and one naval base, but will not amount to separate U.S. bases, the government said.

The deal made by the minority government of Prime Minister Erna Solberg must be ratified by Norway's parliament before coming into force.

""The agreement regulates and facilitates U.S. presence, training and exercises in Norway, thus facilitating rapid U.S. reinforcement of Norway in the event of crisis or war,"" the government said.

Relations between Norway and Russia, which share an Arctic border, gradually improved in the post-Cold War era before suffering a setback when Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014.

That triggered tension in the north with a military build-up on both sides of the border and more frequent military manoeuvres, but both nations also seek to cooperate on local matters such as cross-border travel and fisheries.

Since joining NATO as a founding member in 1949, Norway has said it would not allow foreign bases to be established in peacetime or the stockpiling of nuclear arms, although Western troops are welcome to exercise on its soil.

""Our cooperation with our allies is under continuous development. The agreement reaffirms Norway's close relationship with the U.S. and confirms Norway's key position on the northern flank of NATO,"" Foreign Minister Ine Eriksen Soereide said.

""Our policies regarding the stationing of foreign forces on Norwegian territory, the stockpiling or deployment of nuclear weapons and port visits remain unchanged,"" she said.

0,United States and China are 'committed to cooperating' to tackle climate change,https://www.sbs.com.au/news/united-states-and-china-are-committed-to-cooperating-to-tackle-climate-change,"The United States and China are ""committed to cooperating"" on the pressing issue of climate change, the two sides said Saturday, issuing the pledge days ahead of a key summit hosted by President Joe Biden.

The joint statement came after a trip to Shanghai by US climate envoy John Kerry, the first official from Mr Biden's administration to visit China, signalling hopes the two sides could work together on the global challenge despite sky-high tensions on multiple other fronts.

But to achieve the global climate goal, Mr Kerry said words must be put into action and urged China to reduce its use of coal.

""The United States and China are committed to cooperating with each other and with other countries to tackle the climate crisis, which must be addressed with the seriousness and urgency that it demands,"" said the statement from Mr Kerry and China's special envoy for climate change Xie Zhenhua.

It listed multiple avenues of climate cooperation between the world's top two economies which together account for nearly half of the greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change.

It stressed ""enhancing their respective actions and cooperating in multilateral processes, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement.""

Both countries also ""look forward"" to a virtual climate summit of world leaders that Mr Biden will host next week, though the statement did not say if Chinese President Xi Jinping would attend.

""We very much hope he will take part,"" Mr Kerry, who is now in South Korea, told reporters on Sunday.

""Of course, every country will make its own decisions,"" he said, adding: ""We're not seeking to force anybody. We're seeking cooperation.""

'Biggest coal user'

China currently has about half of the world's coal power, Mr Kerry said, adding that he ""talked a lot"" about it with officials in Shanghai.

""I am not pointing fingers,"" said Mr Kerry.

""We've had too much coal, other countries have too much coal, but China is the biggest, biggest coal user in the world,"" he added.

""And because it's such a big and powerful economy and country, it needs to move.""

Mr Biden has made climate a top priority, turning the page from his predecessor Donald Trump, who was closely aligned with the fossil fuel industry.

The US president has rejoined the 2015 Paris accord, which Mr Kerry negotiated when he was secretary of state, and committed nations to taking action to keep the temperature from rising no more than two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

With the world badly off track to meeting the goal, Mr Biden hopes his summit will result in stronger pledges in advance of UN-led climate talks in Glasgow at the end of the year.

'Unequivocal commitment'

According to their statement, both Washington and Beijing ""intend to develop"" their respective long-term strategies to achieve carbon neutrality by the Glasgow meeting.

Many Indian hospitals were scrambling for beds and oxygen as COVID-19 infections surged to a new daily record on Thursday, with a second wave of infections centred on the rich western state of Maharashtra.

India's tally of total infections is second only to the United States, with experts blaming everything from official complacency to aggressive variants. The government has blamed failure to practise physical distancing.

The country has been producing oxygen at full capacity for each of the last two days but will have to turn to imports, with the health ministry saying it was planning to import 50,000 metric tons.

""The situation is horrible,"" said Avinash Gawande, an official at a government hospital in the industrial city of Nagpur that was battling a flood of patients, as were hospitals in neighbouring Gujarat state and New Delhi in the north.

""We are a 900-bed hospital, but there are about 60 patients waiting and we don't have space for them.""

Maharashtra, home to the financial capital of Mumbai, began a lockdown at midnight on Wednesday, a move that spurred a rush to stockpile essential items in advance. The state, the country's most industrial, has been the worst affected by the pandemic.

At Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan (LNJP) Hospital in New Delhi, the country's largest facility treating COVID-19 patients, two or three patients were seen sharing single beds in some wards, a Reuters witness said. read more

COVID-positive patients - from a one-and-a-half-year-old toddler to many elderly - and their relatives kept streaming in to the emergency ward at LNJP, arriving by ambulance, car or auto-rickshaw throughout the day.

""Last year also we have not seen such a bad situation. This time the number is very high and increasing very rapidly, going (at a) very fast speed, so the situation is really alarming,"" said LNJP Medical Director Suresh Kumar.

""We are definitely overburdened... Today we have 158 admissions in Lok Nayak alone. All sick patients, all severe patients,"" Kumar added.

India has added 200,739 infections over the last 24 hours, health ministry data showed, for a seventh daily record surge in the last eight days, while 1,038 deaths took its toll to 173,123.

Despite injecting the third highest number of vaccines doses worldwide, India has covered only a small part of its 1.4 billion people.

India said on Thursday regulators would decide on emergency-use applications for foreign COVID-19 vaccines within three working days. India's ambassador to Moscow said deliveries of Russia's Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine to India were expected to begin before the end of April, the TASS news agency reported.

Forty-year-old Prashant Mehra said he had to pay a broker for preferential treatment before he could get his 90-year-old grandfather admitted to an overstretched government hospital.

""He died after six or seven hours,"" he said.

Supplies of oxygen ran short in places such as Gujarat, the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

""If such conditions persist, the death toll will rise,"" the head of a medical body in the industrial city of Ahmedabad told its chief minister in a letter.

Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries (RELI.NS) will supply 100 metric tonnes of additional oxygen to Maharashtra, a state minister said.

Advertising Read more

The disclosure came soon before the resumption of talks in Vienna aimed at reviving Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with major powers, an accord Israel fiercely opposed, after former U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned it three years ago.

A fissile purity of 90% is suitable for a nuclear bomb.

Announcing 60% enrichment, chief nuclear negotiator Abbas Araqchi also said Iran would activate 1,000 advanced centrifuge machines at Natanz, a nuclear plant hit by an explosion on Sunday that Tehran called an act of sabotage by its arch-foe Israel.

However, an Iranian official told Reuters later that ""60% enrichment will be in small quantity"" only.

""From tonight, practical preparations for 60% enrichment will begin in Natanz; 60% uranium is used to make a variety of radiopharmaceuticals,"" the semi-official Fars news agency quoted Iranian nuclear agency spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi as saying.

The International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, said it had been informed of Iran's decision.

In Washington, White House press secretary Jen Psaki called Iran's announcement ""provocative"" and said the Biden administration was concerned, adding that it called into question Tehran's seriousness on nuclear talks.

Last week, Iran and the global powers held what they described as ""constructive"" talks to salvage the 2015 accord, which has unravelled as Iran has breached its limits on uranium enrichment since Trump re-imposed harsh sanctions on Tehran.

The deal had capped the level of purity to which Iran can enrich uranium hexafluoride, the feedstock for centrifuges, at 3.67%, far below the 90% needed for bomb-grade material.

Iran in recent months has raised enrichment to 20% purity, a level where uranium is considered to be highly enriched and is a significant step towards weapons-grade. Three-five percent is broadly the level required to run civilian nuclear power plants.

The biggest obstacle to producing nuclear weapons is accumulating sufficient quantities of fissile material - either 90% enriched uranium, or plutonium - for the core of a bomb.

One of the central objectives of the 2015 nuclear containment deal was to extend the time Iran would need to do this, if it chose to, to a year from about 2-3 months.

Iran says it has never sought to obtain or develop nuclear weapons, and that it seeks nuclear technology for civilian purposes in the fields of medicine or energy.

Western intelligence services believe Iran had a clandestine nuclear weapons programme that was mothballed in 2003, though arch-adversary Israel believes it continues in some form and sees Tehran's nuclear activity as an existential threat.

'Bad gamble'

Iran's top diplomat said earlier on Tuesday that the blast in the underground Natanz plant that it blames on Israel was a ""very bad gamble"" that would boost Tehran's leverage in the talks to salvage the nuclear deal.

""I assure you that in the near future more advanced uranium enrichment centrifuges will be placed in the Natanz facility,"" Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told a news conference alongside his visiting Russian counterpart in Tehran.

The nuclear talks are due to resume on Thursday in Vienna.

Tehran has said the explosion at Natanz, which knocked out electricity in centrifuge production halls, was sabotage by Israel and vowed revenge for the incident, which appeared to be latest episode in a long-running covert war.

Israel, which the Islamic Republic does not recognise, has not formally commented on the matter.

U.S. President Joe Biden has said Iran must resume full compliance with curbs on its enrichment activity mandated by the deal, which won the lifting of all international sanctions against Tehran, before Washington can rejoin the pact.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday urged the governments of Western countries to penalise those deliberately spreading their message of hate against Muslims by disrespecting Prophet Muhammad in the same way that they had outlawed any negative comment against the Holocaust.

Speaking after a week of violent protests in Pakistan by a radical party outraged by French government support for magazines publishing cartoons of the Prophet, Khan said in a series of tweets that insulting the Prophet hurt Muslims around the world. “We can’t tolerate any disrespect & abuse,” he said. “I also call on Western governments who have outlawed any negative comment on the Holocaust to use the same standards to penalise those deliberately spreading their message of hate against Muslims by abusing our Prophet.”

The group Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan was banned on Thursday by the Pakistan government. Several European countries and Israel have laws against Holocaust denial.

The 5,800sq km (2,239sq miles) ice block known as A68a broke off from the Antarctic peninsula's Larsen C ice shelf in July 2017.

But satellite images now show the iceberg has broken up into tiny pieces, which are too small to track any further, the US National Ice Center said.

The iceberg spent two years not moving far before it became caught in a powerful current that propelled it northeast.

The structure drew attention in December last year when it looked like it might hit the island of South Georgia, while travelling through the Southern Antarctic Front.

There were concerns it would threaten the island's diverse wildlife if it impacted.

An RAF reconnaissance aircraft was drafted to capture images of A68a in a bid to predict where it might travel.

By this point A68a measured 4,200sq km (1,622sq miles) but it has shrunk further this year, with multiple icebergs calving from it since January.

The ministry told Geo News that the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority had suspended the social media platforms on its instructions.

The immediate reason for the suspension of services was not clear as of yet.

The action was taken after a letter was sent to the PTA chairman by the interior ministry. The ministry, in the letter, had requested the PTA to take action against the issue ""immediately"".

""I am directed to refer to the subject cited above and to state that complete access to social media platforms may be blocked from 11 am to 3 pm on April 16 2021, across the country,"" Abdul Razaq the Section officer of the ministry wrote in the letter.

""It is requested that immediate action may be taken on the subject matter under the information to this ministry,"" he added.



A PTA official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told Geo News: ""In order to maintain public order and safety, access to certain social media applications has been restricted temporarily.""

However, according to various media reports, social media sites shut down in Lahore as law enforcement agencies expect TLP rioters to hit the streets after Friday prayers.

The TLP is protesting against the arrest of their leader Saad Hussain Rizvi, who was taken into custody earlier this week, and blasphemous caricatures published in France. The protests have turned violent and several casualties have also been reported.

At least three people -- including two policemen -- have been killed in the protests, according to Geo News.

The demonstrators have demanded that the French ambassador be sent home and import of goods from that country banned.

According to media reports, the Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government signed an agreement with the TLP in November last agreeing to expel the French Ambassador.

The Tehrik-i-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) group had given the government an April 20 deadline to expel the French ambassador over the publication of cartoons in France depicting the Prophet Mohammad. The authorities responded by arresting its leader, prompting supporters to hold protests and sit-ins across Pakistan. At least four people were killed, hundreds injured, and thousands arrested. Pakistan banned the group after the violence.

A senior police officer and two paramilitary were among the six being held by supporters of (TLP), Lahore police spokesman Arif Rana told Reuters.

""The TLP activists have two fuel tankers containing thousands of liters of petrol. They are throwing petrol bombs and stones at security officials, and also shooting bullets as the result of which 11 officials are injured,"" Rana said, adding the operation was ongoing.

TLP spokesman Shafiq Amini told Reuters four supporters had been killed on Sunday by police and several others were wounded.

Pakistani news channels have been barred from providing coverage of the group since it was banned last week read more , and on Sunday mobile and internet services were down in the area where clashes were taking place.

Roads leading to the headquarters of the group, in Lahore's Chowk Yateemkahan, have been blocked.

Still, supporters of TLP have been sharing videos on social media of what they said were clashes on Sunday with police, and hashtags supporting the group were trending in Pakistan on Sunday.

The videos, which Reuters could not independently verify, showed thousands of protesters clashing with police in riot-gear, as clouds of tear gas hung in the air and the crackle of gunfire could be heard. Other videos showed injured protesters being carried away.

On Saturday Prime Minister Imran Khan said the group had

been banned because it ""challenged the writ of the state and used street violence & attacking the public & law enforcers.""

0,"Canada's main opposition party changes climate change tack, backs carbon pricing",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-climate-conservatives-idUSKBN2C22FN,"Canada's opposition Conservative Party on Thursday dropped its resistance to carbon pricing and adopted the fee on emissions and fuels as part of its own climate plan, a move that could put it at odds with some of its staunchest supporters.

Climate change has proved a thorny issue for the Conservative Party under leader Erin O'Toole. Most Conservative delegates voted against recognizing climate change as a real threat at a policy convention last month.

""We will scrap (Liberal Prime Minister) Justin Trudeau's carbon tax on working Canadians,"" O'Toole said at that convention, noting however that the party ""fought and lost two elections against a carbon tax.""

O'Toole said his own plan was better than the Liberal one. Carbon pricing imposes fees on the use of carbon-based fuels such as oil either through charges for emissions or by adding to the price of gasoline and other fuels.

Trudeau's national carbon price is due to ramp up to C$170 a ton by 2030, though 90% is returned to Canadian taxpayers through rebates. The Conservatives would cap prices at C$50 a ton for taxpayers, who would pay the levy into a government savings account and be able to use the money to make ""green"" purchases like bicycles.

A number of provinces - including the energy heartland and Conservative Party bastion of Alberta - oppose carbon pricing, and challenged the government's scheme in the Supreme Court. Last month, the court upheld Trudeau's plan. read more

""Any new climate plan...must minimize the costs on Albertans and on our trade-exposed industries while at the same time, continuing to responsibly reduce emissions from Alberta,"" Alberta Environment Minister Jason Nixon said.

O'Toole said a Conservative government would meet Canada's international pledge to cut emissions 30% below 2005 levels by 2030, and match greenhouse gas reductions promised in the Liberal climate plan.

""It's outrageous that O'Toole is now planning to hammer Canadians with higher fuel bills through his very own carbon tax,"" said Franco Terrazzano, the Canadian Taxpayers Federation's Alberta director.

Many Liberal insiders expect Trudeau to seek an election later this year. Trudeau's Liberals lead O'Toole's Conservatives 37% to 29%, according an Abacus Data poll published on Thursday.

0,Ukraine top security official believes Iran downed Ukrainian plane intentionally,https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2021/04/16/Ukraine-top-security-official-believes-Iran-downed-Ukrainian-plane-intentionally,"Ukraine’s security chief said he believes the downing of a Ukrainian passenger plane by Iran’s military over Tehran in January 2020 was an intentional act rather than an accident as claimed by the Iranian regime.

Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, told Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail in an interview published on Friday, that he believes the incident was a “conscious attack.”

For all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app.



“When they say this was accidental … I don’t buy that,” Danilov told The Globe and Mail. “It was intentional. This was a conscious attack.”

He said that Iran’s refusal to allow international investigators full access to the evidence has led him to believe that Tehran downed the plane intentionally.

“Iran does not allow anybody to examine this tragedy, and they postpone or slow down any investigations. The fact that they are investigating themselves is rather surprising, to put it politely,” Danilov said.

Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) shot down the Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 on January 8, 2020, killing all 176 people on board. The majority of passengers were Iranian. Citizens from Canada, Ukraine, Britain and Afghanistan were also among the passengers.

After denying responsibility for three days, Iran admitted to downing the plane, declaring it a “disastrous mistake.”

Danilov’s hypothesis is that Iran was looking for a way to prevent a tit-for-tat situation with the United States.

Hours before the plane was shot down, Iran had struck US military bases in Iraq in response to the US killing of the commander of the IRGC’s Quds Force Gen. Qassem Soleimani days earlier.

Iran wanted to make sure there would be no US response to its attack on American military bases in Iraq, according to Danilov.

“Since January 8 of last year, the question has remained in my head: ‘Why do they do this?’ If you remember MH17, which the Russians shot down on the order of military authorities … active military actions came to a halt after this crash, because the whole world was focused on understanding what happened,” he said, referring to the downing of flight Malaysia Airlines in 2014.

“If you project this logic onto what happened on January 8, there was the Soleimani assassination, after which total war was expected. After shooting down the plane and killing our citizens, among others, this [total war] went from first priority to 10th priority,” Danilov added.

Through these remarks, Danilov, as Ukraine’s security chief, is representing the Ukrainian government, Ukraine’s deputy Foreign Minister Yevhen Yenin told The Globe and Mail.

“We don’t believe the version of human error until we see the evidence.” Yenin said, according to the newspaper.

Rehana Dhirani, whose father Asghar Dhirani died in the crash, wrote on Twitter on Friday: “We’ve always known #PS752 was intentional, the excuse of ‘human error’ is a pathetic attempt to cover the actions of the regime.”

Last month, Iran published its final report into the incident. “The plane was identified as a hostile target due to a mistake by the air defence operator...near Tehran and two missiles were fired at it,” the report said, according to the website of Iran’s civil aviation body.

Commenting on the Iranian report, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba described it as, “nothing more than a cynical attempt to hide the true reasons for the downing of our plane.”

“We will not allow Iran to hide the truth, we will not allow it to avoid responsibility for this crime,” Kuleba wrote on Facebook.

In December, Canada’s former foreign minister Francois-Philippe Champagne had also said he does not believe Iranian claims that the plane was shot down as a result of “human error.”

Iran denies

Iran’s foreign ministry rejected Danilov’s accusations on Friday.

“It is unfortunate that, despite all the explanations and expert reports, some Ukrainian officials continue to make vague political statements and present their own personal hypotheses in the media,” foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said, according to the semi-official Fars news agency.

Minister Alymkadyr Beishenaliyev drank a solution made from the roots of aconitum soongaricum at an online briefing to show that it was safe.

""Those with mild symptoms recover within a day, those with more acute form (of the illness) take it three to four days,"" he said.

President Sadyr Japarov had personally provided doctors with a recipe passed on to him by his father, and they were already using it, Beishenaliyev said.

But Bermet Baryktabasova, a medicines expert and a former health ministry advisor, described aconitum as ""the most poisonous plant in Kyrgyzstan.

""...Even the smallest doses of its extract have strong negative effect on the body and the person might quickly die,"" she added. ""We are falling back into the Middle Ages.""

Japan's inability to contain the COVID-19 pandemic means that plans to hold the Olympics in Tokyo should be reconsidered, health experts wrote in a commentary.

Japan has exhibited ""poor performance"" in containing virus transmission, along with limited testing capacity and a slow vaccination rollout, according to the commentary published in the British Medical Journal on Wednesday.

""Plans to hold the Olympic and Paralympic games this summer must be reconsidered as a matter of urgency,"" wrote lead author Kazuki Shimizu of the London School of Economics.

""Holding Tokyo 2020 for domestic political and economic purposes--ignoring scientific and moral imperatives--is contradictory to Japan's commitment to global health and human security.""

The commentary adds to a drum beat of doubt among medical professionals that the Olympics can be carried out safely this summer. A survey of more than 1,000 Japanese doctors last month showed that 75% believed it was better to postpone the Games, according to physician referral company Ishinotomo.

Kyoto University professor Hiroshi Nishiura, an advisor to the government's pandemic response, urged in a magazine commentary this week that authorities postpone the Olympics one year to allow for more time to vaccinate the public.

Japan began its inoculation push in February, later than most major economies. Only 0.9% of the Japanese public have received their first shot so far, compared with 2.5% in South Korea, and 48% in the United Kingdom.

Olympic and government officials have said further postponement of the Games is out of the question.

They have been given 48 hours to leave the country.

Why Czechia is expelling Russian diplomats

On October 16, 2014, there was a blast at a warehouse containing 58 tonnes of ammunition near the eastern Czech village of Vrbetice.

It was followed months later by another big explosion at a nearby warehouse with 98 tonnes of ammunition.

""The explosion led to huge material damage and posed a serious threat to the lives of many local people, but above all it killed two citizens,"" Babis said.

Babis said Czech authorities had ""clear evidence"" linking GRU Russian intelligence agency officers from unit 29155 to the blasts, after receiving information on Friday.

The expelled Russians have all been identified as members of their country's SWR and GRU intelligence services.

Babis added: ""The Czech Republic is a sovereign state and must adequately react.""

But Russia hit back at the accusations. The Interfax news agency cited Vladimir Dzhabarov, first deputy head of the upper house's international affairs committee, as saying Prague's claims were absurd and Russia's response should be proportionate.

Prague on Sunday said it would inform its NATO and European Union allies about its latest findings.

Police hunt for Skripal suspects

Meanwhile, the Czech organized crime squad (NCOZ) said it was looking for two men using Russian passports in relation to the explosions.

The names in the passports are

Alexander Petrov, born in 1979, and Ruslan Boshirov, born in 1978.

Czech police are looking for two men traveling on Russian passports with the same names as the suspects in the attempted 2018 Skripal poisoning in the UK

The names match those of the two people wanted in Britain over the poisoning of double Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury in 2018.

The suspected GRU members are said to have been present in the Czech Republic for six days in mid-October 2014, visiting the region where the ammunition depot is located.

Varadkar has previously admitted that in April 2019, while he was Taoiseach, he sent a copy of a doctors’ pay deal between the State and the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) to his friend, Dr Maitiu O Tuathail.

Dr O Tuathail was head of the rival organisation, the National Association of General Practitioners (NAGP), at the time.

A Garda inquiry into the matter was updated to a criminal investigation in recent weeks

It is also understood that O Tuathail was interviewed by gardai.

Varadkar has apologised for leaking the document, but has denied breaking any laws.

And speaking last month, he said he does not believe he will face criminal charges.

Varadkar was asked, hypothetically, if a member of government should step aside temporarily if criminal charges are brought against them.

He replied: “I’m not contemplating that.

“I’ve been trying to avoid creating new stories about this issue.

“So, you know that’s not something I’m considering.

Toronto, the country’s largest city, Ottawa, Hamilton, Windsor and at least 19 other municipal police forces said they would not conduct random vehicle or individual stops though they had been given the power to do so.

""The Toronto Police Service will continue to engage, educate and enforce, but we will not be doing random stops of people or cars,"" the force said on Twitter. Mayor John Tory supported the move.

Ontario, home to 38% of Canada's population, had 4,362 new infections on Saturday after a record of 4,812 cases on Friday, and projections indicate the virus could spike to 10,000 per day in June without more strict health restrictions.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford, increasingly under fire for mishandling the province's pandemic response, on Friday gave police the authority to stop anyone driving or walking to ask them to explain their reason for leaving home, and ticket them if in breach of the rules. read more

Steven Del Duca, the opposition Liberal Party leader in Ontario, said Ford was imposing ""martial law"" and that the move was a ""dangerous attack on racialized Ontarians"" who would be unfairly targeted.

The expanded police powers risk causing ""a rash of racial profiling and overbroad police powers, presuming everyone outside guilty until proven otherwise,"" Canada's Civil Liberties Association said.

Ford also said he would block non-essential travel from neighboring provinces from Monday. Ontario's Provincial Police on Saturday said they were preparing to enforce that order.

In recent weeks, Ontario has closed schools, restaurants, limited in-store shopping, and canceled elective surgeries as a surge of admissions threatened to overwhelm hospitals. On Friday it also shut down some construction work, but not warehouses or factories.

Critics say Ford abandoned a previous stay-at-home order too soon, allowing current spike in cases that is putting hospitals under pressure. On Friday, Ford blamed the federal government for the third wave, saying it had been too slow to ramp up vaccinations and too lenient at the borders.

As part of an executive order signed by President Biden Joe BidenSuspect in FedEx shooting used two assault rifles he bought legally: police US, China say they are 'committed' to cooperating on climate change DC goes to the dogs — Major and Champ, that is MORE, the administration through the Treasury Department will block U.S. financial institutions from purchasing bonds from Russia's Central Bank, National Wealth Fund or Ministry of Finance after June 14 and from lending funds to these institutions. The directive also leaves open the possibility for the administration to expand the sanctions on Russian sovereign debt.

Additionally, the Biden administration is expelling 10 personnel from the Russian diplomatic mission in Washington, some of whom U.S. officials say are representatives of Russian intelligence services.

The Biden administration is also sanctioning six Russian technology companies that it says provide support for Russian intelligence operations, along with 32 individuals involved in Russian efforts to influence the 2020 election. An unclassified intelligence report last month said that Moscow sought to aid former President Trump Donald TrumpDC goes to the dogs — Major and Champ, that is Biden on refugee cap: 'We couldn't do two things at once' Taylor Greene defends 'America First' effort, pushes back on critics MORE and damage President Biden’s candidacy.

Biden sent a letter to Congress announcing the executive order against Russia on Thursday, noting that he had determined that “harmful” activities by the Russian government, including election interference and hacking efforts, “constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.”

Senior administration officials later emphasized to reporters that the actions against Russia should be viewed as “resolute but proportionate,” and that the administration was prepared to take further steps if Russia continued its malicious activities against the United States.

“There are elements of this new EO that give us additional authorities that we are not exercising today,” the senior official said. “We would prefer not to have to deploy these authorities, but the scope and potential to cause meaningful impact should send a clear signal that continued harmful activities, including further election interference, further malicious cyber activities are unacceptable, and we are prepared going forward to impose substantial and lasting costs if this behavior continues.”

The sanctions have been in the works for some time. When Biden took office, he immediately ordered a review of Russia’s involvement in the massive SolarWinds hack, Russian election interference, the poisoning of Alexei Navalny and reported Russian bounties on U.S. service members in Afghanistan.

The SolarWinds hack, first discovered in December, involved Russian hackers exploiting software from IT group SolarWinds to gain access to as many as 18,000 customers, successfully compromising nine federal agencies and 100 private-sector groups.

U.S. intelligence agencies in January said the attack was “likely” carried out by Russian hackers but did not fully attribute it. As part of Thursday’s actions, the Biden administration issued a formal attribution naming Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) as the culprit behind what has become one of the largest cyber espionage attacks in U.S. history.

As part of the response to the malicious Russian hacking, the FBI, the National Security Agency and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued an alert Thursday providing details on vulnerabilities used by the Russian hackers, along with ways to further defend networks.

The alert exposed five vulnerabilities currently being used by the SVR to compromise organizations, with the three agencies urging all cybersecurity groups to “check their networks for indicators of compromise related to all five vulnerabilities” and “implement associated mitigations.”

Additionally, Biden is planning to sign a separate executive order in the upcoming weeks to strengthen federal cybersecurity, and the administration is working with foreign allies to create what a senior administration described as “a framework of responsible state behavior in cyberspace.”

“As the SolarWinds incident has shown, we have to build both domestic and international partnerships and threat intelligence sharing to ensure we can identify, defend against, and mitigate malicious cyber activity from Russia and other adversaries,” the official told reporters.

The administration, in coordination with U.S. allies, already announced sanctions to punish Russia for the Navalny poisoning and his subsequent jailing, with administration officials teasing since February that there would be a response around the SolarWinds hack in “weeks, not months.”

Foreign allies on Thursday expressed support for the Biden’s administration’s actions against Russia, with the United Kingdom separately assessing that the Russian SVR was behind the SolarWinds attack.

The European Union and its member states put out a joint statement to “express their solidarity” with the U.S., and condemn malicious cyber activity.

“The European Union and its Member States remain strongly committed and determined in their solidarity with their international partners in promoting a global, open, stable and secure cyberspace respecting human rights, fundamental freedoms, democratic values and principles and the rule of law, in order for everyone to safely live their lives online, as well as offline,” the EU said.

NATO's governing body also issued a statement expressing support for the U.S. actions.

“Russia continues to demonstrate a sustained pattern of destabilising behaviour,” the NATO statement reads in part. “We stand in solidarity with the United States.”

The already-tense U.S.-Russia relationship has deteriorated further under the Biden administration as the new president has publicly blamed Moscow for its malign behavior, signaling a departure from the Trump era during which Trump often spoke warmly of Russian President Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinNavalny doctor says he could 'die at any moment' Sunday shows preview: Russia, US exchange sanctions; tensions over policing rise; vaccination campaign continues Russia blocks key Biden Cabinet officials from entering in retaliation for sanctions MORE and questioned the U.S. assessment of Russian election interference.

In an interview with ABC News in March, Biden said that Russia would “pay a price” for interfering in the 2020 presidential election and responded in the affirmative when asked if he believed Putin was a killer. Russia reacted angrily to his comments and recalled the Russian ambassador to the U.S.

Biden spoke with Putin by phone on Tuesday and “made clear that the United States will act firmly in defense of its national interests in response to Russia’s actions, such as cyber intrusions and election interference,” according to a White House readout. Biden also raised concerns about Russian military buildup along Ukraine’s border and proposed a summit in the coming months where the U.S. and Russia could discuss a range of issues.

Hitler's food tester opens up about screening meals in the 'Wolf's Lair' after 68 years of secrecy

Unless he breaks the conditions of his sentence, the suspended sentence means the man won’t actually have to spend time in prison.

“Lunch today! Egg dumplings with green salad!” the man posted, together with a photo. “Blondi is missing,” one of the defendant’s friends wrote, allegedly in reference to Hitler’s dog, according to ORF , an Austrian public broadcaster.

We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

The man, who has not been identified, shared the photograph on Facebook last year, on April 20, Hitler’s birthdate.

An Austrian police officer received a suspended prison sentence of ten months for posting the apparent favourite food of Adolf Hitler.

The defence’s argument that the photo was a coincidence, and that “Blondi” was in reference to a blonde beer, failed to convince the jury.

According to a 2016 report by Vice Germany, the dish may be used as a thinly-veiled code by neo-Nazis.

The police officer was found guilty by a vote of five to three, although the conviction could change, the broadcaster reported. He was given a ten-month suspended prison sentence and fined €6,300 ($9,500) at a regional court in Eisenstadt, eastern Austria. It’s unclear whether he will exercise his option to appeal.

The man was charged under the Verbotsgesetz 1947, also known as the Prohibition Act 1947, which aims to put an end to Nazi propaganda.

The man was temporarily suspended as a police officer, but had subsequently resumed duty. A spokesperson for Burgenland State Police Command said they’re determining further disciplinary action.

Hitler was born near the German border in Austria and later moved to Munich. In recent years, Austria has struggled to flush out the presence of far-right beliefs, including in politics. In 2018, the conservative government faced criticism for forming a coalition with the FPO after it came to light that some leaders participated in songs celebrating the Holocaust in a fraternity with ties to Nazis.

The far-right deputy mayor in the town of Braunau am Inn, where Hitler was born, had to step down in 2019 after referring to immigrants as “rats” in a poem.

0,MPs condemn ‘grotesque’ revelations that Uighur workers are sold online in China,https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/china/mps-china-uighur-labourers-genocide-b1833040.html,"MPs have condemned an “utterly grotesque” report revealing that Uighur labourers are being advertised in batches on the Chinese internet and made to work under “half-military management”.

Wealden MP Nusrat Ghani described “groups of Uighurs being sold like slaves for auction” as “horrific” and “utterly grotesque”.

Reacting to the report on Sky News, former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith said that there’s “no question” in his mind that the Chinese authorities are engaged in genocide.

“The truth is that the Chinese authorities are engaged in – absolutely no question now, in my mind – in genocide,” he said. “They’re trying to eradicate an ethnic group.”

The report, produced by Sky News correspondent Tom Cheshire, says that there are dozens of adverts on websites hosted by Baidu advertising Uighur labourers in batches of 50 to 100 workers.

One agent who posted such an advert reportedly told Sky News that workers from Xinjiang are subject to a “political examination” by the local government of their receiving province and that they are placed under “half-military management” while working.

The Xinjiang government says in its 2019 five-year plan that its “labour transfer programme”, which Baidu allegedly facilitates, is aimed at providing “more employment opportunities for the surplus rural labour force”.

It has described claims from human rights groups that Uighur Muslims are actually subject to forced labour as “the lie of the century”.

China’s government has also described allegations that it is carrying out a genocide of Uighur Muslims at “re-education camps” in Xinjiang as “ridiculously absurd” and a “complete lie”.

A report released by the Washing DC-based Newlines Institute for Strategy think tank concluded last month that China’s government “bears responsibility for committing genocide” and that it has violated every provision of the United Nation’s Genocide Convention in its actions towards the Uighurs in Xinjiang.

The House of Commons will debate the “mass human rights abuses and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region” on 22 April, in a motion led by Ms Ghani.

The debate may be followed by a non-binding vote on whether to declare China responsible for genocide. Such a vote could further strain diplomatic ties between the UK and China, a key trading partner.

Speaking to Sky News, Mr Duncan Smith cast doubt that the British government will be willing to condemn China.

“The government refuses to say that this is genocide because they say that only a competent court can do so,” he said. “But the problem we’ve got is, the only competent court that can call a genocide a genocide concerning a national purpose are actually either the International Criminal Court or the International Court of Justice.

“China’s not a signatory to the Criminal Court and the Court of Justice gets blocked at the UN in the Security Council, of which they are a member.”

In response to Sky News’s report and Mr Duncan-Smith’s comments, a Foreign Office spokesperson toldThe Independent: “The evidence of widespread human rights violations in Xinjiang cannot be ignored – including mass detention and invasive surveillance and reports of torture and forced labour.

“The UK has taken robust action in response, including targeted sanctions against those responsible as well as introducing measures to help ensure UK organisations are not complicit in these violations.

“The international community will not look the other way and will hold the Chinese authorities to account for their actions.”",645,4173,12,80
0,8 FedEx employees killed in shooting at Indianapolis facility; suspect also dead,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/shooting-reported-fedex-facility-indianapolis-n1264249,"Eight people were killed after a gunman opened fire at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis late Thursday before killing himself, according to police.

Four others who were shot and another who was injured were taken to hospitals, officials said, adding that some may have been privately transported to medical facilities.

No law enforcement officers were hurt in the shooting carried out by a former employee who last worked at the facility in the fall, authorities said Friday afternoon.

A motive for the attack wasn't immediately clear, but a year ago, the shooter's mother said she feared he might be suicidal.

“In March 2020, the suspect’s mother contacted law enforcement to report he might try to"" attempt ""suicide by cop,"" said FBI Special Agent in Charge Paul Keenan, who runs the bureau's Indianapolis field office.

The phrase ""suicide by cop"" refers to a self-destructive person who intentionally draws the attention of police in hopes of a deadly confrontation.

""A shotgun was seized at his residence. Based on items observed in the suspect’s bedroom at that time, he was interviewed by the FBI in April 2020. No Racially Motivated Violent Extremism (RMVE) ideology was identified during the course of the assessment and no criminal violation was found,"" the statement said. ""The shotgun was not returned to the suspect.”

Law enforcement officials identified him as 19-year-old Brandon Scott Hole.

The shooting was reported shortly after 11 p.m. ET and officers arrived to an active shooter incident, according to police.

""This suspect came to the facility, and when he came there he got out of his car and pretty quickly started some random shooting outside the facility,"" Craig McCartt, deputy chief of criminal investigations for the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, said during a news conference Friday morning.

McCartt said the initial investigation shows there was no disturbance or argument that preceded the shooting, which lasted about two minutes.

The suspected gunman killed himself shortly before police arrived, he said, adding that investigators believe he had a rifle.

Four bodies were found outside the facility, and four more were found inside, McCartt said.

Police said Friday evening that Matthew R. Alexander, 32; Samaria Blackwell, 19; Amarjeet Johal, 66; Jaswinder Kaur, 64; Jaswinder Singh, 68; Amarjit Sekhon, 48; Karli Smith, 19; and John Weisert, 74, were killed in the shooting.

FedEx CEO Frederick W. Smith said the eight killed were company employees.

""This is a devastating day, and words are hard to describe the emotions we all feel,"" he said in a statement.

""I want to express my deepest sympathies to the families, friends, and co-workers of those team members,"" he said, adding that counselors were on site at the facility to provide support.

""We have a team onsite in Indianapolis to provide support, and we are making counselors available. This is a devastating day, and words are hard to describe the emotions we all feel."" Read Frederick W. Smith's letter to team members: https://t.co/hs53dTkax8 — FedEx (@FedEx) April 16, 2021

A FedEx employee told NBC's ""TODAY"" show that he was sitting outside the building when he heard what he initially thought was a car with engine problems. He soon realized the sound was actually gunfire.

""And when I stand up, I see a man — a hooded figure — I was unable to see his face in detail however,"" Levi Miller said.

He said the man had a rifle ""and he started shouting, and then he started firing in random directions."" He couldn't tell what the gunman was yelling. ""I thought he saw me and so I immediately ducked for cover,"" Miller said.

Family members were waiting at a nearby Holiday Inn Express hotel early Friday to hear if their loved ones were safe while police chaplains provided support, WTHR photojournalist Joe Fenton tweeted.

McCartt said there was some frustration in connecting family members with survivors because employees did not have their cellphones on them as they fled the building.

FedEx said in a statement that ""to minimize potential distractions around package sortation equipment and dock operations, cellphone access within certain areas of FedEx Ground field operations is limited to authorized team members.""

Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett offered prayers to ""the families of those whose lives were cut short"" and thanked the ""city’s first responders for their tireless work overnight.""

""Their quick response provided critical aid to those injured in the shooting and brought a measure of calm to an otherwise chaotic scene,"" he said in a tweet.

""What we are left with this morning is grief — grief for the families of those killed, grief for the employees who have lost their co-workers, grief for the many Americans struggling to understand how tragedies like this continue to occur again and again,"" Hogsett said Friday morning.

Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb ordered flags to be flown at half-staff.

""This is another heartbreaking day, and I’m shaken by the mass shooting at the FedEx Ground facility in Indianapolis,"" he said in a statement. ""In times like this, words like justice and sorrow fall short in response for those senselessly taken.""

U.S. Rep. André Carson, D-Indiana, whose district includes Indianapolis, said that he was devastated by the incident.

""I am heartbroken by the mass shooting at the FedEx facility here in Indianapolis and praying for all affected by this tragedy,"" he said on Twitter.

There have been several mass shootings in the United States in recent weeks, including an April 8 shooting at a cabinet company facility in Bryan, Texas, that left one person dead and five others wounded.

This is the third high-profile shooting this year in Indianapolis.

In January, five people, including a pregnant woman, were shot dead in the city's northeast side. And in March, a man fatally shot three adults and a child at a home in a dispute over a stimulus check, police said.

President Joe Biden also ordered flags be lowered to half-staff.

""Last night and into the morning in Indianapolis, yet again families had to wait to hear word about the fate of their loved ones. What a cruel wait and fate that has become too normal and happens every day somewhere in our nation,"" Biden said in a statement.

The shooting ""is just the latest in a string of tragedies, following closely after gunmen firing bullets in broad daylight at spas in and around Atlanta, Georgia, a grocery store in Boulder, Colorado, a home in Rock Hill, South Carolina, and so many other shootings,"" he said.

Last week, Biden announced a series of executive actions aimed at tackling what he called a national ""epidemic.""

""Gun violence is an epidemic in America. But we should not accept it. We must act,"" he said Friday.

His proposals, which are likely to face legal hurdles, are aimed at reducing mass shootings, suicides and domestic violence.

They aim to limit so-called ""ghost guns,"" which can be assembled at home without traceable serial numbers, and make it easier for relatives to flag family members who shouldn't be allowed to buy firearms.

Biden is also seeking to reduce access to stabilizing braces, which can effectively turn a pistol into a more lethal rifle while not being subject to the same regulations that a rifle of similar size would be.

Vice President Kamala Harris said Friday: ""Yet again we have families in America that are grieving the loss of their family members because of gun violence. There is no question this violence must end and we are thinking of the families that lost their loved ones.

Gun violence, in general, has skyrocketed in recent years.

The Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit group that tracks gun violence in the U.S., found that more than 19,000 people died in gun homicides last year. This was the the highest yearly figure in more than two decades, up by nearly 25 percent from 2019.

Andrew Harnik/Pool via REUTERS

Former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo violated federal ethics rules governing the use of taxpayer-funded resources when he, and his wife, asked State Department employees to carry out personal tasks more than 100 times, a government watchdog said in a report on Friday.

Pompeo, who was former President Donald Trump's last secretary of state, served until Jan. 20, when Republican Trump left the office after being defeated by Democrat Joe Biden in the November election.

Pompeo is seen as among a handful of Republicans with presidential ambitions for 2024, even though the former top diplomat has not confirmed that.

Pompeo and his wife asked a political appointee and other employees in his office to carry out tasks such as ""picking up personal items, planning events unrelated to the Department's mission, and conducting such personal business as pet care and mailing personal Christmas cards,"" the State Department's Office of Inspector General (OIG) said in the report.

""The Pompeos made over 100 requests to employees in the office of the secretary to conduct work that appeared to be personal in nature,"" the report, which can be found here, said.

Among the incidents detailed in the report were a request from Susan Pompeo for an aide to make two hair salon appointments for her. On another occasion, an under secretary of state appeared to help the Pompeos' son secure a discount for a hotel room, the report said.

Pompeo slammed the report, saying it was politically motivated and filled with factual errors.

""At no time did I, or my wife Susan, misuse taxpayer money or violate rules or ethical norms,"" Pompeo said in a statement. ""Our actions were constantly reviewed by dozens of lawyers, and we made massive efforts, and did, comply with every requirement,"" he said.

Pompeo during his tenure had a contentious relationship with the Department's watchdog. A former inspector general, Steve Linick, was fired by Trump at Pompeo's recommendation.

Linick was probing whether Pompeo misused a taxpayer-funded political appointee to perform personal tasks for himself and his wife.

OIG said it had completed most of its fieldwork on the report by August 2020. Its completion of the report was delayed because Pompeo refused to grant an interview to the OIG for several months until sitting down with them in December.

A State Department spokesman said the agency concurred with ""all the recommendations (in the report) and will proceed to implement them.""

A report from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute estimated that at least 80,000 Uighur workers were transferred out of Xinjiang between 2017 and 2019, although it said the actual figure was likely to be far higher.

Human rights groups have warned that such strict controls could amount to forced labour.

The Chinese government has previously described such claims as ""the lie of the century"". It did not respond to our request for comment on this story.

Facilitating labour transfers relies on a network of private agents.

On Chinese websites, there are dozens of postings advertising Uighur labour, in batches of 50 to 100 workers.

Those adverts suggest tight political and social controls. One states that the ""security of workers will be guaranteed by the government"".

We contacted numbers left on the labour adverts.

One agent told us that workers from Xinjiang needed to be ""examined politically"" before they could be transferred.

The local government of the receiving province would also do a ""political examination"".

All workers would be accompanied by ""supervisors"", the agent said, and ""under half-military management"".

Another said that without local government approval, workers could not be arranged because ""the ethnic minority issue is a severe problem"".

A third said the salary of the ""supervisors"" was paid by the Personnel Bureau of the Xinjiang government.

State media often celebrates the working conditions of Uighur workers in other parts of China.

One local news video describes 200 Uighur workers at a factory in Shandong, a coastal province in east China, saying: ""Supported by all relevant government departments, the company develops well.

""They will continue creating a harmonious work environment for our Uighur compatriots.""

The owner of the factory, a seafood processing plant, said that all the Uighur workers had returned home to Xinjiang because of the pandemic and that reports of forced labour was ""nonsense"".

He said that workers went there because they chose to, earned at least £300 per month, and had air conditioners in their on-site dormitories.

Those dormitories were monitored by CCTV in a front office which also contained riot control gear.

If workers wished to leave the factory, the owner told us, the company would take them in two buses.

Twelve police officers and Communist Party officials then arrived.

They questioned us for two hours, before ordering us to leave town.

At another seafood processing factory in the same province, which until recently had a UK subsidiary, according to Companies House filings, a manager waiting at the entrance said there were no Uighur workers, nor had there been in the several years he had worked there.

But an article on the company's own website, posted on 18 March 2020, shows Uighur workers arriving from Xinjiang.

The accompanying announcement says that their arrival will help alleviate poverty and the ""integration of the national family"".

0,Gas furnaces’ grills melt as cremations continue 24x7 | Covid Situation in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/gas-furnaces-grills-melt-as-cremations-continue-24x7/articleshow/82008914.cms,"Iron frame inside the gas furnace on which a body is placed

Surat: The heavy rush of bodies at Surat crematoriums over the last two weeks has taken a toll on its ‘modern’ infrastructure. City crematoriums equipped with gas furnaces are being used for cremation round the clock. As a result, the iron frames on which the bodies are placed inside the gas furnace has started melting at all crematoriums.

Gas furnaces at all three crematoriums of Diamond City are facing the melting issue. A similar issue has also come up in neighbouring Bardoli town.

Along with the melting of frames, the burners also require frequent maintenance as they are being used round the clock. “Earlier we used to cremate 20 bodies in a day of which few were cremated on a wood pyre while others were cremated in gas furnaces. The load was limited and each furnace got enough time to cool down. But now, we are handling over 80 bodies daily and each furnace is in use round the clock. Hence the iron frames have started melting and breaking,” said an official at Ramnath Ghela Crematorium (RGC).

At Ashwini Kumar Crematorium (AKC) too currently two furnaces are not working. “The frames are melting and gas burners get clogged. As the furnaces are in constant use, we are facing this difficulty,” said an official at AKC.

Kurukshetra Crematorium (KC) has employed a team of technicians for frequent maintenance of the gas furnaces. “We have employed a team which is available round the clock to repair the furnace. Due to 24 hours use the furnaces break down many times,” said an official at KC.

0,The EU is considering a ban on AI for mass surveillance and social credit scores,https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383301/eu-ai-regulation-draft-leak-surveillance-social-credit,"The European Union is considering banning the use of artificial intelligence for a number of purposes, including mass surveillance and social credit scores. This is according to a leaked proposal that is circulating online, first reported by Politico, ahead of an official announcement expected next week.

If the draft proposal is adopted, it would see the EU take a strong stance on certain applications of AI, setting it apart from the US and China. Some use cases would be policed in a manner similar to the EU’s regulation of digital privacy under GDPR legislation.

GDPR, but for artificial intelligence

Member states, for example, would be required to set up assessment boards to test and validate high-risk AI systems. And companies that develop or sell prohibited AI software in the EU — including those based elsewhere in the world — could be fined up to 4 percent of their global revenue.

According to a copy of the draft seen by The Verge, the draft regulations include:

A ban on AI for “indiscriminate surveillance,” including systems that directly track individuals in physical environments or aggregate data from other sources

A ban on AI systems that create social credit scores, which means judging someone’s trustworthiness based on social behavior or predicted personality traits

Special authorization for using “remote biometric identification systems” like facial recognition in public spaces

Notifications required when people are interacting with an AI system, unless this is “obvious from the circumstances and the context of use”

New oversight for “high-risk” AI systems, including those that pose a direct threat to safety, like self-driving cars, and those that have a high chance of affecting someone’s livelihood, like those used for job hiring, judiciary decisions, and credit scoring

Assessment for high-risk systems before they’re put into service, including making sure these systems are explicable to human overseers and that they’re trained on “high quality” datasets tested for bias

The creation of a “European Artificial Intelligence Board,” consisting of representatives from every nation-state, to help the commission decide which AI systems count as “high-risk” and to recommend changes to prohibitions

Perhaps the most important section of the document is Article 4, which prohibits certain uses of AI, including mass surveillance and social credit scores. Reactions to the draft from digital rights groups and policy experts, though, say this section needs to be improved.

“The descriptions of AI systems to be prohibited are vague, and full of language that is unclear and would create serious room for loopholes,” Daniel Leufer, Europe policy analyst at Access Now, told The Verge. That section, he says, is “far from ideal.”

Experts say the wording in the draft legislation is unhelpfully vague

Leufer notes that a prohibition on systems that cause people to “behave, form an opinion or take a decision to their detriment” is unhelpfully vague. How exactly would national laws decide if a decision was to someone’s detriment or not? On the other hand, says Leufer, the prohibition against AI for mass surveillance is “far too lenient.” He adds that the prohibition on AI social credit systems based on “trustworthiness” is also defined too narrowly. Social credit systems don’t have to assess whether someone is trustworthy to decide things like their eligibility for welfare benefits.

On Twitter, Omer Tene, vice president of nonprofit IAPP (The International Association of Privacy Professionals), commented that the regulation “represents the typical Brussels approach to new tech and innovation. When in doubt, regulate.” If the proposals are passed, said Tene, it will create a “vast regulatory ecosystem,” which would draw in not only the creators of AI systems, but also importers, distributors, and users, and create a number of regulatory boards, both national and EU-wide.

This ecosystem, though, wouldn’t primarily be about restraining “big tech,” says Michael Veale, a lecturer in digital rights and regulations at University College London. “In its sights are primarily the lesser known vendors of business and decision tools, whose work often slips without scrutiny by either regulators or their own clients,” Veale tells The Verge. “Few tears will be lost over laws ensuring that the few AI companies that sell safety-critical systems or systems for hiring, firing, education and policing do so to high standards. Perhaps more interestingly, this regime would regulate buyers of these tools, for example to ensure there is sufficiently authoritative human oversight.”

It’s not known what changes might have been made to this draft proposal as EU policymakers prepare for the official announcement on April 21st. Once the regulation has been proposed, though, it will be subject to changes following feedback from MEPs and will have to be implemented separately in each nation-state.

0,#IAmHongKonger campaign looks to assert Hong Kongers’ identity in Canadian census,https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2021/04/14/iamhongkonger-campaign-looks-to-assert-hong-kongers-identity-in-canadian-census.html,"A social media campaign has been launched to encourage Hong Kongers and their descendants in Canada to mark themselves as such in the next Canadian census.

Through the hashtag #IAmHongKonger on Twitter and Instagram, Canadians with close ties to the former British colony are being asked to “stand up for their own identity” in the Canadian population survey that starts next month.

“Hong Kongers have a different culture; we have a different language. We want to show that we exist. I feel like my identity is under threat and being erased,” said Crispin Chow, 22, a campaign organizer.

“They can do this by marking ‘Hong Kong’ down as their ethnic origin in the long-form census and listing ‘Cantonese’ as one of their spoken languages at home in the short-form.”

According to Canada’s 2016 census, there are at least 215,775 Hong Kong-born immigrants residing in Canada, but no official figures track those of Hong Kong ethnic or cultural descent, according to the campaign.

That’s because they are currently marked as “Chinese” in the census, unless they specify otherwise in the blank space, though the questionnaire does ask for the respondent’s country of birth as well as ancestors’ ethnic or cultural origin.

Those who checked the box as South Asians, for instance, can specify if they are East Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan or others.

The #IAmHongKonger organizers said the Canadian government has yet to officially recognize Hong Kongers’ identity. Without reliable statistics, organizers said, service providers, policy-makers and community organizations are unable to serve the needs of this unique population.

The drive couldn’t have come at a more sensitive time in the Canada-China relationship, with Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor still held by Beijing while Chinese Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou is awaiting the outcome of her potential extradition to the U.S. from Canada.

Some Hong Kongers have long complained about the forced assimilation with Mainland Chinese since the island’s takeover by China in 1997, and many Canadians with dual citizenship in Hong Kong are returning to Canada in the wake of Beijing’s national security law, which was passed last year and which many view as an attempt to stifle opposition voices and suppress freedoms.

Chow, a University of Waterloo student, said the campaign started off with a group of friends chatting about the upcoming census and their shared desire to assert their identity as Hong Kongers. They then spread the ideas among their network of friends.

He said none of the organizers have any political affiliation and they don’t want the public to think that the campaign is politically motivated to target the Chinese government.

“We know that it could be a problem, but at the end of the day, we can fill out as many ethnic origins as you identify yourself,” said Chow, who was born in Canada but grew up in Hong Kong. “We are only speaking for ourselves.”

Born to a Canadian parent in Hong Kong, Maya Lee returned to Canada only five years ago and said she strongly feels her identity as a Hong Konger rather than just as ethnic Chinese.

“Hong Kongers have a very unique identity. We have a very different culture, a different language. We want to show the rest of the world that Hong Konger identity does exist,” said the 22-year-old University of Toronto student, who self-identifies as a Canadian and Hong Konger.

“For our community, it’s very difficult to be lumped into the Pan-Asian or Chinese group, because our food and traditions are so different. Most of the time, our community feels very unseen. It’s almost like a slow erasure and loss of our identity.”

The campaign aims to enhance Hong Kong Canadians’ civic participation and strengthen their Hong Konger identity and to unite the diaspora in Canada.

Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading...

The objectives struck a chord with Sybil Tong, whose family moved to Canada in 1998 when she was a toddler. Raised in Markham, she said she is very familiar with Hong Kong culture and traditions, which are the products of its unique history.

“It’s a mix of eastern and western. We have our own language and own food, and everything that would make any culture its own,” said Tong, 25, an urban planner.

“Our identity is something that should always be on the forefront. It goes beyond the census. If we identify as Hong Kongers, that’s something Canada should take note of. Diversity is our strength.”

0,Defense Department confirms leaked video of unidentified aerial phenomena is real,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/15/politics/unidentified-aerial-phenomena-defense-department/index.html,"(CNN) The Defense Department has confirmed that leaked photos and video of ""unidentified aerial phenomena"" taken in 2019 are indeed legitimate images of unexplained objects.

Photos and videos of triangle-shaped objects blinking and moving through the clouds were taken by Navy personnel, Pentagon spokeswoman Sue Gough said in a statement to CNN. She also confirmed that photos of three unidentified flying objects -- one ""sphere"" shaped, another ""acorn"" shaped and one characterized as a ""metallic blimp"" -- were also taken by Navy personnel.

""As we have said before, to maintain operations security and to avoid disclosing information that may be useful to potential adversaries, DOD does not discuss publicly the details of either the observations or the examinations of reported incursions into our training ranges or designated airspace, including those incursions initially designated as UAP,"" Gough said.

She also said that the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force , created in August to investigate UFO sightings observed by the military, has ""included these incidents in their ongoing examinations.""

The Navy photos and videos were published by Mystery Wire and on Extraordinary Beliefs' website last week but had been circulating online since last year.

0,"There’s a Pandemic Sperm Shortage, and “Sperm King” Megadonors Are in High Demand",https://www.insidehook.com/daily_brief/news-opinion/pandemic-sperm-shortage-donors,"These may not seem like ideal times to bring new life into the world, but apparently not everyone sees it that way. In fact, despite the well documented difficulty of parenting during a pandemic, it would seem many aspiring parents have decided to move forward with their reproductive plans anyway. So many, in fact, that sperm banks can’t keep up.

According to The New York Times, sperm banks have seen a record-breaking increase in demand over the past several months. Maybe prospective parents think the flexibility of the work-from-home era makes it easier to carve out time for parenthood, or maybe, as Michelle Ottey, director of operations at Fairfax Cryobank, told the Times, “they’re just trying to find some hope right now.” But whatever the reason, people want pandemic babies, and the sperm banks are struggling to meet demand. While more people want sperm, fewer are donating it during the pandemic, and this supply shortage has left many prospective parents trying to get their sperm fix elsewhere — namely, the internet.

Enter the “sperm kings,” as the Times‘ Nellie Bowles has dubbed them. These are men donating their sperm, largely free of charge, through online networks. You can find them in massive Facebook groups like Sperm Donation USA, which boasts around 11,000 members and counting. According to Bowles, these groups have seen a recent surge in new members seeking sperm from these “off-brand megadonors.”

It’s easy to understand why these online communities are a big draw for aspiring parents. They want sperm, sperm banks don’t have enough to give, and these unregulated online alternatives offer a less expensive option with fewer hoops to jump through. But what’s in it for the sperm kings, many of whom receive little to no financial compensation for their goods and/or services?

For some, it might be a sex thing. While most donors reportedly specify they will donate through artificial insemination only, others offer donations via “natural insemination,” also known as sex. As one might imagine, “the line between altruism and a sexual kink can get murky quickly,” Bowles noted.

For most guys, however, the call to spread their seed seems to be more about the urge to reproduce without the burden of parenthood. “I have a strong desire to know my genes have been passed on,” one donor wrote on donor-finding app Just A Baby. “Like many of us, I’m not in a position to do so at the moment nor do I foresee this is in the near future.” While the idea of fathering myriad children might sound chaotic, some men seem attracted to the idea of siring a massive brood. “I have this vision of me being in my 50s and 60s, and I have a large dinner table, and I’m inviting all my donor kids to join me for dinner,” one popular donor told the Times.

Whatever the reason, however, the sperm kings know their reproductive material is a hot commodity, and many of these good semen Samaritans are content to give it away for free.

0,Global Covid death toll nears 3m as India sees another daily record rise in cases,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/17/new-delhi-placed-under-weekend-lockdown-as-covid-wave-worsens,"The global coronavirus death toll has topped 3 million as the race for immunisation continues and countries such as India grapple with rising infections and new lockdowns.

Data released by Johns Hopkins University on Saturday showed 3,000,225 deaths and 139,963,964 cases globally.

The figures come as a new wave of the pandemic in India pushed the number of cases in the country to almost 14.5m, second only to the United States, which has reported more than 32m.

India recorded 234,692 new infections in the 24 hours to Saturday morning, according to health ministry data, the eighth record daily increase in nine days. Fatalities rose by 1,341 to reach a total of 175,649.

In Japan, rising virus cases have stoked speculation that the Olympic Games – postponed last year due to the pandemic – could be cancelled.

Japan’s prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, in his first meeting with US president Joe Biden, said his government was listening to experts and doing its “utmost” to prepare for the Tokyo games in July.

In Brazil, the country with the third-highest death toll in the world, night shifts have been added to several cemeteries as diggers work around the clock to bury the dead. Women have been advised to delay becoming pregnant because the virus variant that is devastating the South American country appears to affect expectant mothers more than earlier versions of the coronavirus.

Hopes that south Asian countries might have beaten the pandemic have been dashed with India recording more than 2m cases this month alone and Bangladesh and Pakistan imposing shutdowns.

India’s per-capita rates remain low by international comparison, raising the prospect that infection numbers – fuelled possibly by a virulent new “double mutant” – may explode further.

After a national lockdown a year ago led to hundreds of deaths and one of the worst slumps of any major economy, the Indian government has been desperate to avoid a second stoppage. However, many states areclamping down, including Maharashtra, where the biggest city is Mumbai, industry-heavy Gujarat, and Karnataka, which is home to the IT hub Bengaluru.

Uttar Pradesh state, home to about 240 million people, announced on Friday that all villages and cities would be under lockdown for one day on Sunday.

In the capital, Delhi, which has overtaken Mumbai as the worst-hit Indian city, restaurants, malls, gyms and spas were shut for the weekend. Weddings can go ahead with guests limited to 50, while a maximum of 20 people can attend funerals. Movie theatres can open with one-third capacity.

“Don’t panic. All essential services will be available through the weekend,” said the city’s chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal.

The northern state of Uttarakhand restricted gatherings to 200 people, but exempted the vast ongoing Hindu festival Kumbh Mela.

The gathering in Haridwar has attracted as many as 25 million people since January, including about 4.6 million this week alone, with most people ignoring Covid-19 guidelines. One seer died from the virus on Thursday and 80 other holy men have tested positive. Experts fear that the millions of devotees will now take the virus back to their home towns and villages.

Election rallies are also going ahead in the eastern state of West Bengal, with home minister Amit Shah attending two roadshows and one public meeting on Friday alone.

In state capital Kolkata, railway employee Samaresh Tapna fell sick after attending one such gathering and was admitted to hospital. “I felt angry with myself ... I cursed my fate,” the 42-year-old told Agence-France Presse.

Hospitals are running short of oxygen and coronavirus medicines such as Remdesivir, prompting desperate people to pay exorbitant rates on the black market.

Social media is full of horror stories of desperate calls to help a loved one needing hospital treatment for Covid-19 or other complaints. “I lost a cousin on Saturday. He was not admitted after a stroke. Tried 4 hospitals,” read one message on a Delhi neighbourhood WhatsApp group this week.

India’s drive to vaccinate its 1.3 billion people has also hit obstacles, with just 117 million shots administered so far and stocks running low, according to some local authorities.

“[It is] understandable that many people are sick of the restrictions and want to resume normal life. We must redouble our efforts to contain this disease as too many lives are at stake,”

“This is a wake-up call to the world. Vaccines must be available to everyone, everywhere, rich and poor to overcome this terrible pandemic,” said Udaya Regmi from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), calling the surge across south Asia “truly frightening”.

There was some better news in Europe, where some countries are easing their lockdowns in response to not only fatigue, but falling infection numbers and progress with vaccinations.

Italy announced on Friday it would ease coronavirus restrictions for schools and restaurants from 26 April. England eased some restrictions this week with other countries in the UK following closely behind. In the US, nearly 200 million people have been vaccinated.",830,5161,15,81
0,‘We love foie gras’: French outrage at UK plan to ban imports of ‘cruel’ delicacy,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/17/we-love-foie-gras-french-outrage-uk-plan-import-ban-delicacy,"The head of France’s foie gras producers’ association has said she is “shocked and outraged” that the British government is considering banning imports of the product.

And she has invited MPs to visit French farms producing foie gras to see the force feeding of ducks and geese and judge for themselves whether it is “cruel and torturous”, as animal rights campaigners claim.

Marie-Pierre Pé, director of the Comité Interprofessionnel des Palmipèdes à Foie Gras (CIFOG), which represents about 3,500 foie gras producers, said: “I am shocked and I deplore the fact that the freedom to sell a perfectly healthy product defined under international conventions is threatened.

“For a country that promotes freedom of trade, it is not only paradoxical but shows a lack of understanding of our production as well as the problem of judgments based on anthropomorphic perceptions that the animal used in the production is suffering.

“Clearly, they don’t know how we do our job. Before taking this decision I invite them to visit a foie gras producer so they can make a rational decision. We have nothing to hide and we operate with complete transparency.”

Asked about the gavage, the most controversial aspect of foie gras production, where long tubes are pushed down the birds throat to pump food into the digestive system, causing the liver to swell to several times its natural size, Pé said campaigners were anthropomorphising – attributing human characteristics to animals – by claiming this harmed or hurt the ducks and geese.

“People have to stop imaging a tube being inserted in their own throat, because a duck and goose’s throat is nothing like yours. For a start, the duck’s throat is elastic and at the base there is a pocket that allows them to stock food – called gésiers, which is like our stomach,” she said.

“It does no harm to them. Of course, you have to know how to insert the tube, but if done properly the animal does not suffer and scientific studies have been made into the possible effects of the gavage, so we know.”

“The gavage is done twice a day respecting the digestive rhythm of the animal. We cannot force the digestive cycle because if we did it would then get blocked and you wouldn’t get the foie gras.

“We cannot say there are no accidents from time to time, but it is exceptional. A farmer has no interest in harming his own animals because that would kill them – and his production.”

A cross-party group of British MPs has written to ministers urging them to ban sales of foie gras in the UK. The letter to the environment secretary, George Eustice, and the animal welfare minister, Lord Goldsmith, was coordinated by the campaign group Animal Equality.

“Over the coming months, thousands more ducks and geese will endure torturous treatment for this cruel product,” the letter states.

The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it was “exploring further restrictions” to the delicacy following reports that Goldsmith was determined to ban sales in the UK, having described it earlier this year as “unbearably barbaric”.

Abigail Penny, executive director of Animal Equality UK, said: “Foie gras is the definition of animal cruelty and people are clearly united in their hatred for this wicked product. We simply cannot tolerate this any longer. A ban can’t come soon enough.”

However, opponents of a ban disagree. Richard Corrigan, who runs several Mayfair restaurants, has said that a ban would take the UK into “nanny-state territory”, while George Pell, the co-owner of L’Escargot, said there was a “paradox between people happily eating industrially farmed food products and advocating the ban”.

Pé said the legality of foie gras production had been examined “several times” and had been found to conform with European food regulations.

“Yes, there have been videos with shocking images from farms but they are exceptions and those farms do not reflect our sector and our profession,” she said. “Our farms are controlled by the authorities and the producers pledge to guarantee the welfare of the animal.”

She added: “I can understand if people don’t like foie gras, or they don’t want to eat animals or animal products, but there is respect for the animals in our production. I have no problem stating this because I know it is true.

“I am outraged and sad,” Pé said. “Surely the British government will not pass a law based on one-sided arguments. I personally invite them to come and see for themselves.”

Pé said foie gras had been singled out for a ban, “because foie gras is a gastronomic symbol of France. I think we are an easy target.

“It’s a recurrent theme and strategy by the animal rights groups. They produce sensational images to influence economics. We should ask ourselves, ‘are we being manipulated?’”

France is the world’s largest producer, consumer and exporter of foie gras. CIFOG says French farmers produced 15,000 tonnes of foie gras last year – down on the 18,800 tonnes produced in 2019 – mostly in and around the Périgord region, in south-west France. Up to 5,000 tonnes are exported annually, with up to 200 tonnes a year coming to Britain.

Pé said that despite Covid restrictions that shut winter markets and hit sales before the Christmas holidays – a period when foie gras is traditionally eaten – producers reported 1.2 million new French buyers in 2020. The sector has since been hit by outbreaks of avian flu.

“There is no problem in terms of support for our products in France,” she said. “The French love foie gras, there is extraordinary support for it,” she added.

0,"Cuba's Raul Castro confirms he's stepping down, says he's 'fulfilled his mission'",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cubas-raul-castro-confirms-stepping-head-communist-party-rcna689,"Raul Castro confirmed Friday he is stepping down as the head of the Communist Party of Cuba, the most powerful position on the island.

During a speech on the first day of the Communist Party's eighth congress, he said he would hand over power to a younger generation that is ""full of passion and anti-imperialist spirit.""

""I believe fervently in the strength and exemplary nature and comprehension of my compatriots, and as long as I live, I will be ready with my foot in the stirrups to defend the fatherland, the revolution and socialism,"" Castro told party delegates at the closed-door meeting at a convention center in Havana.

He was retiring, Castro said, with the sense of having “fulfilled his mission and confident in the future of the fatherland.”

Though there are few expectations of significant change among Cubans, it is however a historic move — Castro and his late brother, Fidel Castro, have been in power since the 1959 revolution.

Though Castro did not name his successor during the speech, it's expected that a subsequent vote will ratify President Miguel Díaz-Canel as the next party secretary-general and set policy guidelines.

Raul Castro had said in 2018 he expected Díaz-Canel to replace him after his retirement in 2021. Díaz-Canel, 60, represents a new generation and is serving the first of two five-year terms as president.

Many analysts believe Castro, who turns 90 in June, will continue to be the most influential figure on the island until his death.

In Cuba, major events are put together during historic celebrations and this year’s congress is no exception. It coincides with the 60th anniversary of the failed, CIA-backed Bay of Pigs invasion.

Castro’s retirement comes as Cuba, one of the last communist run-countries in the world, is facing multiple challenges. Its economy shrank 11 percent in 2020 due to the pandemic, and it's been grappling with tightened U.S. sanctions and a decline in aid from its ally, Venezuela. The government lacks hard currency to import food and medicine, which means endless lines outside stores when food becomes available, and one meal a day for some families.

The country is also dealing with a spike in Covid-19 cases. Strict lockdowns and measures have kept the numbers of cases and deaths below those of most countries in the region, but they have also tested the patience of many Cubans. Cuba has developed five vaccine candidates and two are in late-stage trials.

The country’s challenges have led to public discontent at levels rarely seen since the 1959 communist revolution. Mobile internet has allowed videos of protests to quickly spread among Cubans and also helped activists mobilize. A large protest in November by artists demanding greater freedom of expression made headlines across the globe.

President Joe Biden campaigned on reversing some of the previous administration’s harsh measures, such as limits on remittances and restricted travel to the island by Americans while focusing on human rights. But so far, administration officials have indicated they won’t be making changes anytime soon. Juan Gonzalez, executive director of the National Security Council, said recently that the “political moment” has changed from the Obama administration years and that “oppression against Cubans is worse today than perhaps during the Bush years.”

Disenchantment in the island over the country’s centrally planned system, stagnant economy and decaying infrastructure has been brewing for years, especially among younger Cubans. During the Communist Party’s congress in 2011, a set of ambitious economic reforms were promised that have not been fully implemented.

Victoria Hernández 37, an entrepreneur who sells products such as hangers and batteries in East Havana, says she does not expect much from the congress.

“I think our officials should change their mentality more to improve things. Right now what we’re thinking about is food. I want to also think about having a car, a better house,” she said.

Need for economic reform

But some experts believe Castro's move is important in order to speed up economic reforms. This involves strategic decisions in order to keep the public more content without ceding the tight grip the party has over society.

Arturo López-Levy, a professor at Holy Names University in California, thinks the economic reforms will gain traction once the pandemic is under control.

“What is happening now is a new generation is consolidating control,” he said. “Now they will be forced to make important reforms, because their legitimacy doesn't come from a revolutionary background, but from being capable of showing better performance.”

He said there aren’t high expectations among Cubans because the country “will remain a Leninist system and that basically means the political monopoly of the Communist Party.”

Fabio Fernández, a history professor at the University of Havana, often quoted in the Communist Party newspaper Granma, says it’s important for the party to move forward, fulfill the economic reforms it promised over a decade ago, and make political changes without abandoning its socialist system.

“A new concept of Cuban socialism is what we need to adopt because the old one no longer works,” he said.

There is growing international concern for jailed Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny, as his team warned he is now dangerously ill and could die within ""a matter of days.""

Navalny’s allies are calling for mass protests next week, saying if the Kremlin is not forced to give Navalny medical care, he will die.

Navalny, known as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest critic, is 19 days into a hunger strike in prison, where he was sentenced after returning to Russia having survived a nerve agent poisoning last year.

He declared the hunger strike to protest the prison’s refusal to provide him with medical treatment for severe back pain caused by two suspected hernias, but in recent days, his team has said his health has deteriorated fast.

In a message calling for the protests, his team said Navalny’s life is now “hanging by a hair” and accused the Kremlin of “killing Navalny for a second time before the eyes of all Russia.""

Since Friday, his team has been sounding the alarm that Navalny’s health is rapidly declining and warning that the threat to his life is now as serious as when he was poisoned last August.

“Events are developing too quickly and too badly. The life of Alexey Navalny and the fate of Russia depends on how many citizens come out to the streets this Wednesday,” Navalny’s team said in a statement on its website.

Doctors helping Navalny’s family said on Saturday blood tests showed his potassium levels are “catastrophically” high, meaning that he could suffer heart failure at ""any moment."" One of the doctors, Yaroslav Ashikhmin, said the tests also suggested that Navalny’s kidneys are now shutting down.

In such a condition, Ashikhmin wrote on Facebook, a patient would normally be moved to an intensive care unit.

""People usually avoid using the word 'dying,'"" Navalny’s spokesperson Kira Yarmysh wrote on Facebook Saturday. “Me personally because I don’t like throwing such big statements around. But right now Alexey is dying. In his state, it is a matter of days.”

Yarmysh and other members of Navalny’s team said they now fear that the Kremlin has decided to put an end to the challenge posed by him, by allowing him to die out of sight in the prison camp. Navalny's doctors again sought to visit him Sunday but said they were denied entry.

On Friday, Russian prosecutors moved to have Navalny’s key organizations declared ""extremist groups,"" which would outlaw his movement and put anyone supporting him at risk of lengthy prison sentences. The request to ban the groups -- the Anti-Corruption Foundation and Navalny’s regional campaign headquarters -- is the most serious attempt yet to destroy Navalny's movement.

The European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on Sunday issued a statement expressing “deep concern” about Navalny’s condition and demanding that the Kremlin grant immediate medical access to him. The bloc’s foreign ministers will discuss the situation at a meeting on Monday, it said in a statement.

The U.S. State Department also called for Russia to immediately give Navalny access to medical care.

""Russian authorities are responsible for Aleksey Navalny's well-being, and we call on them to allow him access to necessary medical care immediately in response to disturbing reports his health is deteriorating,"" the department's spokesperson Ned Price wrote on Twitter.

Before Navalny fell ill, his allies had planned to hold a mass protest this spring once 500,000 people registered on a website saying they were ready to take part. But on Sunday, Navalny’s team said they could no longer wait given how critical the situation was.

The team called for protests in the central squares of every Russian city at 7 p.m. local time, coinciding with the same day that Putin is due to give an annual state-of-the-nation address.

In January, the Kremlin was able to shut down protests that broke out after Navalny returned to Russia and was jailed on parole violations that have been widely condemned as politically motivated. After police detained thousands during the protests, Navalny’s team was forced to call for further demonstrations. The plan to gather 500,000 online registrations was intended to ensure protests were large enough to have an impact, but Navalny’s decline has upended that plan.

Observers in Moscow said they feared that Russia having weathered the protests in January and only having received symbolic sanctions from Western countries over Navalny’s jailing, the Kremlin may have concluded it can now allow him to die.

""The danger is that the collective Kremlin may have decided to end the Navalny problem once and for all: he may die in detention, and his infrastructure will be destroyed. Protests? They can be suppressed and will go into decline,” Andrei Kolesnikov, an analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Center, wrote on Twitter.

Navalny's team said said next week's protests have become a final showdown with the Kremlin to stop Navalny's death and prevent the complete destruction of a democratic opposition in Russia.

""if we are silent now then the darkest time will come for free people,"" Leonid Volkov and Ivan Zhdanov, two top Navalny aides, said in a video posted Sunday. ""Russia will sink into total darkness.""",868,5307,12,81
0,Doctors home in on cause of blood clots potentially linked with Covid-19 vaccines,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/16/health/blood-clots-vaccine-possible-cause/index.html,"(CNN) Doctors say they are homing in on the cause of blood clots that may be linked with certain coronavirus vaccines, and add their findings have important implications for how to treat the condition, regardless of whether vaccines cause it.

Even though the link is not yet firm, they're calling the condition vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia or VITT. It's characterized by unusual blood clotting combined with a low number of blood-clotting cells called platelets. Patients suffer from dangerous clots and, sometimes, hemorrhaging at the same time.

It's been linked most firmly with the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, which is in wide use in Europe and the UK.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration are checking to see if Johnson & Johnson's Janssen vaccine also might cause the blood clots. Both AstraZeneca's vaccine and the J&J vaccine use common cold viruses called adenoviruses as a carrier and some experts suspect the body's response to those viral vectors might underlie the reaction. AstraZeneca's vaccine is not authorized in the US.

The FDA and CDC have asked for a pause in giving out the J&J vaccine while they investigate.

A team led by Dr. Marie Scully, a hematologist at University College London Hospitals, studied 22 patients who developed the syndrome after receiving AstraZeneca's vaccine, and found they had an unusual antibody response. These so-called anti-PF4 antibodies had only been seen before as a rare reaction to the use of the common blood thinner heparin.

The findings support a theory that an immune reaction might underlie the rare blood clots, but the findings don't yet explain it, Scully and colleagues r eported in the New England Journal of Medicine Friday. What may be going on is a reaction by the immune system with platelets to cause uncontrolled clotting.

If vaccines cause it, it's still very rare and unusual, they wrote. It might not even be happening any more often in recently vaccinated people than among the population in general.

""The risk of thrombocytopenia and the risk of venous thromboembolism after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 do not appear to be higher than the background risks in the general population, a finding consistent with the rare and sporadic nature of this syndrome,"" they wrote.

""The events reported in this study appear to be rare, and until further analysis is performed, it is difficult to predict who may be affected. The symptoms developed more than five days after the first vaccine dose,"" they added.

""In all cases reported to date, this syndrome of thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) and venous thrombosis (blood clot) appears to be triggered by receipt of the first dose of the (AstraZeneca) ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Although there have been a few reports of patients with symptoms consistent with this clinical syndrome after the receipt of other vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, none have yet been confirmed to fulfill the diagnostic criteria,"" they added.

But if vaccination can cause the condition, it would be important to recognize that and treat it appropriately -- because the usual treatment for blood clots is not recommended for VITT.

Patients should be given anti-clotting drugs, but not heparin, and infusions of a blood product called intravenous immunoglobulin may replace the depleted platelets.

It's also not clear who's at highest risk, Dr. Douglas Cines of the University of Pennsylvania and Dr. James Bussel of Weill Cornell Medicine wrote in a commentary. ""Most of the patients included in these reports were women younger than 50 years of age, some of whom were receiving estrogen-replacement therapy or oral contraceptives. A remarkably high percentage of the patients had thromboses at unusual sites,"" they wrote.

Some European countries have restricted who should get AstraZeneca's vaccine. For example. Belgium limits its use in people under age 55. Other countries have paused its use. CDC's vaccine advisers have been asked to consider whether similar restrictions might be appropriate for Johnson & Johnson's vaccine, although only a handful of cases have been reported in the US.

While blood clots in the brain have received the most attention, patients have also had clots in other large veins and arteries.

These blood clots in the brain -- called cerebral venous sinus thromboses or CVST -- are dramatic on their own, but the clots may be forming elsewhere, also.

Doctors are being advised to run tests if people develop blood clots after having been vaccinated recently against coronavirus, and to not use heparin to treat the clots until VITT has been ruled out.

The condition is very similar to a known development called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, the American Society of Hematology says new guidance released earlier this week . It's also calling the condition VITT.

ASH published guidance saying normal post-vaccination malaise, headache and fever are not of concern.

""Patients with severe, recurrent, or persistent symptoms, particularly intense headache, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, vision changes, shortness of breath, and/or leg pain and swelling, either persisting or beginning four to 20 days following vaccination should be evaluated urgently by a medical provider and consideration given to underlying VITT,"" ASH says in the new guidance.

""While current information links VITT to AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, patients with suggestive timing and symptoms following any COVID-19 vaccine should be evaluated for VITT.""

CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has scheduled a meeting for April 23 to take up the question again after declining to make a decision Wednesday. One committee member told CNN more data is needed.

""We need to know what the size of the problem is,"" said Dr. Kevin Ault, professor and division director with the University of Kansas Medical Center. ""So we're going to shake the trees in the databases that the CDC has and we also need to know what the denominator is -- is it just young women or the whole population that's been vaccinated?""

CDC wants to know if there is anything specific that might put people at higher risk of developing blood clots after vaccination.

""There are still a fair number of people in the United States who have been vaccinated in the last two weeks,"" Ault said. ""We've seen these reactions within two weeks, so it doesn't sound like a very long time, but we'll have a fair amount of data in just those nine or ten days.""

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

In a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine, scientists at Janssen, the vaccine arm of Johnson & Johnson, say there isn't enough evidence to show the company's Covid-19 vaccine causes the blood clots and they are ""working closely with experts and regulators to assess the data, and we support the open communication of this information to health care professionals and the public.""

""At this time,"" they write, ""evidence is insufficient to establish a causal relationship between these events and the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine.""

After gifting and selling tens of millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses abroad, India suddenly finds itself short of shots as new infections surge in the world's second-most populous country.

India breached 200,000 daily infections for the first time on Thursday, and is trying to inoculate more of its population using domestically produced shots.

Facing soaring cases and overflowing hospitals after lockdown restrictions were eased, it also abruptly changed the rules to allow it to fast-track vaccine imports, having earlier rebuffed foreign drugmakers like Pfizer (PFE.N). read more

It will import Russia's Sputnik V vaccine starting this month to cover as many as 125 million people.

The reversal in fortunes could hamper not only India's battle to contain the pandemic, but also vaccination campaigns in more than 60 poorer countries, mainly in Africa, for months.

The COVAX programme, backed by the World Health Organization and Gavi vaccine alliance, aims at equitable vaccine access around the world, and is relying heavily on supplies from India, Asia's pharmaceutical powerhouse.

But so far this month India has only exported around 1.2 million vaccine doses. That compares with 64 million doses shipped abroad between late January and March, according to data from the foreign ministry.

An official with knowledge of India's vaccine strategy said that available shots would be used domestically while the country faced an ""emergency situation"".

""There is no commitment to other countries,"" he said.

India's foreign ministry, which oversees vaccine deals with other countries, said last week that Indian demand would dictate the level of exports.

Resulting shortages are already being felt in some countries in the COVAX scheme, and a U.N. health official involved in the vaccine rollout in Africa said: ""To be so reliant on one manufacturer is a massive concern.""

The director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, said earlier this month delays in supplies from India could be ""catastrophic"". read more

MISSTEPS

Four sources involved in discussions on vaccine supplies and procurement said factors including delays by India and COVAX in placing firm orders, a lack of investment in production, raw material shortages and underestimating the coronavirus surge at home had contributed to vaccine shortages.

The Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's biggest vaccine manufacturer, had vowed to deliver at least 2 billion COVID-19 shots to low and middle-income countries, with nearly half of that by the end of 2021.

But it has also come under pressure to meet the needs of other governments, including Britain, Canada and Saudi Arabia, amid AstraZeneca's global production problems.

The United States, meanwhile, ring-fenced the supply of key equipment and raw materials for its own vaccine makers, limiting SII's operations and delaying by months its goal of raising monthly output to 100 million from up to 70 million now, said one of the sources.

A further initial hurdle to SII's supply ambitions was India's hesitation in placing firm orders, two sources said.

That could have allowed it to boost output of the AstraZeneca vaccine early, even though regulators had yet to approve it.

India spent months discussing the final price per dose, and inked an initial purchase order roughly two weeks after India's drug regulator approved the AstraZeneca shot, according to the sources.

At one point, SII ran out of space to store produced doses.

""That is why I chose not to pack more than 50 million doses, because I knew if I packed more than that, I would have to store it in my house,"" SII Chief Executive Adar Poonawalla told Reuters in January.

He said he had spent 20 billion rupees ($272 million) on the 50 million doses that the company started stockpiling since around October.

Even now, the government only makes ad-hoc purchases from SII instead of agreeing a longer-term supply schedule, said one of the sources.

SII has sought more than $400 million from the government to increase capacity, but no commitment has yet been made.

The health department and foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment on issues of funding, purchasing delays and other aspects of India's vaccination rollout.

COVAX CONUNDRUM

COVAX also did not green-light shipments to participating countries from SII until after the shot received WHO clearance in mid-February, said a source involved in the COVAX initiative.

The source said those delays meant tens of millions of additional doses that the SII could have produced between October and February never materialised.

Gavi defended its decision to wait for proper approvals before going ahead with firm orders. And while it is looking for more suppliers, it conceded that much still depended on India's vaccine makers who account for some 60% of global supplies.

COVAX has a deal to buy 1 billion-plus doses from the SII. But it has received less than a fifth of the 100 million or so doses of the SII-made AstraZeneca vaccine it had expected by May. SII is also supposed to make millions of doses of the Novavax (NVAX.O) shot for COVAX.

Gavi had hoped SII would fully resume vaccine deliveries to COVAX in May, but on Wednesday it said India's COVID-19 crisis could affect that.

""We understand the ferocity of the virus in India at the current time, nevertheless we hope and expect deliveries to resume as soon as possible,"" it said in an email to Reuters.

On Thursday India reported 200,739 infections over the past 24 hours, a seventh daily record in the last eight days, while 1,038 deaths took its toll to 173,123. Its tally of 14.1 million infections is second only to the United States.

Having originally aimed to cover 300 million of its highest-risk people by August, or just over a fifth of its 1.35 billion population, the government has now expanded that by another 100 million, with the promise to widen it further.

The couple decided to investigate the possibility of making a vaccine for that mysterious and highly contagious virus using mRNA. Within weeks, BioNTech scientists developed an experimental vaccine in partnership with American pharma giant Pfizer. And 10 months later, the vaccine cleared clinical trials and regulatory hurdles and began going into tens of millions of people’s arms around the world.

For Şahin and Türeci, it’s time to pick up the cancer research where it’s left.

“We have several different cancer vaccines based on mRNA,” Türeci told The Associated Press in an interview on Friday. Though it’s too early to predict when such a vaccine will be available, the prospect is promising. “It’s very difficult to predict in innovative development. But we expect that within only a couple of years,” Türeci added.

The biotech community has been studying mRNA for two decades. The medical platform works by carrying instructions for making antigen proteins found on the surface of a virus into body cells. The antigen will then be copied and produced in more cells to prime the immune system against that specific virus.

The same principle can be applied in tackling other immune system-related illnesses, such as influenza, malaria and cancer.

For cancer, mRNA is being investigated as a way to deliver to cells the protein codes in a specific tumor, which could be personalized to match an individual’s cancer mutations. The cells then produce those proteins and train the immune system to guard off the cancer.

Boston-based Moderna, which developed an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine in a similar record time, is also investigating the tech’s potential in treating and preventing other diseases. The firm has 24 mRNA-based vaccines or therapies in the works, including three vaccine projects announced in January: one for HIV, one for seasonal flu, and the third Nipah virus, which causes encephalitis and has a fatality rate of up to 75 percent.

On Friday, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier awarded Şahin and Türeci with the Order of Merit, one of the country’s highest honors, during a ceremony attended by Chancellor Angela Merkel.

The couple stressed that success with BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine is a team effort. “It’s about the effort of many: our team at BioNTech, all the partners who were involved, also governments, regulatory authorities, which worked together with a sense of urgency,” Türeci said. “The way we see it, this is an acknowledgement of this effort and also a celebration of science.”",458,2861,14,81

China's Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine was 67% effective in preventing symptomatic infection, data from a huge real-world study inChile has shown, a potential boost for the jab which has come under scrutiny over its level of protection against the virus.

The CoronaVac vaccine was 85% effective in preventing hospitalizations and 80% effective in preventing deaths, the Chilean government said in a report, adding that the data should prove a ""game changer"" from the vaccine more widely.

Rodrigo Yanez, Chile's vice trade minister who forged a deal with Sinovac to host the drug's clinical trial and buy 60 million doses of the drug over three years, said the results showed Chile had made ""the right bet"".

""It's a game changer for that vaccine and I think it ratifies quite graphically the discussion over its efficacy,"" he told Reuters, adding it should help it with approvals with the World Health Organization as the first real-world study.

Chile's stock of CoronaVac is running low, with the supply of an agreed total of 14.2 million to be fully delivered by late May. Yanez said he was negotiating an additional 4 million doses of the vaccine and for now, the country will switch to using more of the Pfizer-BioNTech (PFE.N), (22UAy.DE) doses it is due.

The release of the CoronaVac data makes Chile one of a handful of countries, including Britain and Israel, that have used their rapid inoculation campaigns to gather insights into how effective vaccines are outside controlled clinical trials and when faced with unpredictable variables in societies.

Israel's real-world study of the effectiveness of Pfizer's vaccine looked at the results among 1.2 million people, a mix of those who received the shot and those who did not.

Chile's study examined CoronaVac's effectiveness among 10.5 million people, again looking both at people who had been vaccinated and those who had not. Vaccines were administered approximately 28 days apart.

The CoronaVac data published by Chile compares favorably with previous data released on its efficacy in clinical trials.

Brazilian trials have indicated general efficacy of the drug at preventing symptomatic infection at just above 50%, though shower far higher efficacy at preventing hospitalization and against moderate and severe cases.

Indonesia gave the vaccine emergency-use approval based on interim data showing it was 65% effective, while in a Turkish trial it had an efficacy in preventing symptomatic infection of 83.5% and 100% in preventing severe illness and hospitalization.

The Chilean study looked at the impact of the vaccine among people in the public health system between Feb. 2-April 1, adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, income and nationality.

Its authors stressed that its results, for example a lower protection against death than in clinical trials, should be considered against the backdrop of a fierce second wave of the pandemic.

It compared people who were not inoculated, individuals 14 days or more after receiving one dose and more than 14 days after receiving a second dose. Protection against the virus was far higher after the second shot.

Rafael Araos, the Chilean public health official who presented the study, said the report did not specifically look at how the vaccine stood up to coronavirus variants, including the P1 mutant first identified in Brazil.

""The study was done during a period of high circulation of the virus, including of the variants - so these results are positive if we don't have variants and also if we do,"" he said.

PHILIPPE WOJAZER/Reuters

If one Tyrannosaurus rex - the school bus-sized meat-eating dinosaur that stalked the Cretaceous Period landscape - seems impressive, how about 2.5 billion of them?

Researchers on Thursday unveiled the first calculation of the total T. rex population during the estimated 2.4 million years that this fearsome species inhabited western North America during the twilight of the age of dinosaurs.

They considered factors including the size of its geographic range, its body mass, growth pattern, age at sexual maturity, life expectancy, duration of a single generation and the total time that T. rex existed before extinction 66 million years ago. They also heeded a doctrine called Damuth’s law linking population to body mass: the bigger the animal, the fewer the individuals.

Story continues below advertisement

Their analysis put the total number of T. rex individuals that ever existed at about 2.5 billion, including approximately 20,000 adults alive at any one time.

Fossils of more than 40 T. rex individuals have been found since it was first described in 1905, providing a wealth of information about a beast that thrives in the popular imagination.

“Why iconic?” asked paleontologist Charles Marshall, who led the study published in the journal Science.

“Heck, a hugely massive killer with super-huge teeth, one that you would never dream up on your own if we didn’t have the fossil record. So not only super-cool and beyond the imagination, but real. Like Godzilla, but actually real. And I think we like feeling small, and T. rex sure makes us feel small and vulnerable,” Prof. Marshall said.

Inside Victoria’s Dino Lab, where ancient bones await new homes

It was among the largest carnivorous dinosaurs, possessing a skull about five feet (1.5 metres) long, massive and muscular jaws with a bite force capable of crushing bone, a mouthful of banana-sized serrated teeth, a keen sense of smell, strong legs and puny arms with hands boasting just two fingers.

Perhaps the largest-known T. rex is a specimen named Sue at the Field Museum in Chicago, measuring 40-1/2-foot-long (12.3-metres), weighing an estimated nine tons and living about 33 years.

The new study put the weight of the average adult T. rex at 5.2 tons, average lifespan at 28 years, generation time at 19 years, total number of generations of the species at about 125,000, and its geographic range at roughly 890,000 square miles (2.3 million square kilometers).

Story continues below advertisement

They calculated an average population density of about one T. rex for every roughly 40 square miles (100 square kilometres).

T. rex fossils have been found in Alberta and Saskatchewan and the U.S. states of Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. T. rex apparently met a fiery end when an asteroid slammed into Mexico, exterminating three quarters of Earth’s species.

While the uncertainties in the estimates were large and some of the assumptions may be challenged by other paleontologists, the study was a worthwhile effort to expand the understanding of this famous dinosaur, said Prof. Marshall, director of the University of California Museum of Paleontology and a University of California, Berkeley professor of integrative biology.

The formula could be applied to other extinct animals, Prof. Marshall added.

Paleontologist and study co-author Ashley Poust of the San Diego Natural History Museum said while 2.5 billion is a lot, it represents only about a third of Earth’s current human population - and 20,000 is merely the size of a small town.

“They’d have to meet up over possibly long distances to mate, or maybe even care for their young,” Prof. Poust said of Tyrannosaurus. “The numbers can seem big and cold, but I guess I see them as a pretty intimate window into their lives.”

0,PM Imran asks Western govts to outlaw disrespect for Prophet on lines of Holocaust,https://www.dawn.com/news/1618749,"Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday asked the governments of Western countries to ""penalise those deliberately spreading their message of hate against Muslims"" by disrespecting Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in the same way that they had ""outlawed any negative comment against the Holocaust"".

In a series of tweets, Prime Minister Imran clarified that his government had only taken action against the recently proscribed Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) after members of the party ""challenged the writ of the state, used street violence and attacked the public and law enforcers"".

""No one can be above the law and the Constitution,"" he emphasised.

Addressing the ""extremists abroad who indulge in Islamophobia and racist slurs to hurt and cause pain"" to the international Muslim community, the prime minister said that Muslims ""have the greatest love and respect for our Prophet PBUH"" and cannot tolerate any disrespect and abuse.

He added that the ""extremists"" who sought to hurt Muslim sentiments by deliberately indulging in abuse and hate under the guise of freedom of speech ""clearly lack moral sense and courage"" to apologise to the 1.3 billion Muslims they hurt.

The prime minister demanded an apology from such people.

Turning to governments in the West, he called on them to ""use the same standards to penalise those deliberately spreading their message of hate against Muslims by abusing our Prophet PBUH"" as they did regarding comments made about the Holocaust.

TLP protest and ban

Earlier this week, the TLP had taken to the streets across the country especially in Punjab after its chief Saad Hussain Rizvi was detained by security forces in Lahore.

Starting on Monday, charged TLP activists blocked roads across the country, damaged public properties, clashed with police, and even held some law-enforcement personnel hostage, videos of which were widely shared on social media. Expulsion of the French ambassador to Pakistan was one of the key demands of the protesters.

The clashes saw authorities use water cannons, tear gas, and rubber bullets to hold back crowds. This was followed by the police launching a crackdown against the protesters and getting roads cleared of protest camps.

In September 2020, French magazine Charlie Hebdo had republished blasphemous sketches of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) that triggered protests across the Muslim world. In October, a history teacher who had shown blasphemous sketches of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in class was decapitated and his assailant shot dead by French police as they tried to arrest him. In the days that followed the beheading, the caricatures were projected onto the facade of a building in one French city and people displayed them at protests around the country.

Following the killing, French President Emmanuel Macron criticised Islamists and vowed not to ""give up cartoons"" depicting Prophet Muhammad. Prime Imran Khan as well as other leaders of Muslim countries had denounced the French premier's comments while countrywide protests were held calling for boycott of French products.

TLP was among the parties and groups that mounted protests in Pakistan.

Later, it called off the protests after an agreement was signed between the group and the government that stated that the government would reach a consensus in the parliament regarding the expulsion of the French ambassador within three months, would not appoint its ambassador to France and would release all the arrested workers of the TLP. The government would also not register any case against TLP leaders or workers, it stated.

In the first week of the new year, TLP threatened to relaunch its protest if the government did not fulfil its promise of expelling the French ambassador by Feb 17. However, a new agreement was signed between the party and the government in which it was decided that the latter would present the terms of the earlier agreement in the parliament before April 20.

The government then decided to arrest TLP chief Saad Hussain Rizvi as a ""pre-emptive measure"" ahead of the deadline, resulting in countrywide protests.

After the latest violent protests, the government on Thursday slapped a ban on the TLP. A notification declaring it as a proscribed organisation was issued by the Ministry of Interior shortly after the federal cabinet approved a summary to ban the party.",691,4346,14,82
0,A Small Island Suddenly Emerges In Indonesia Following Seroja Cyclone Thunderstorm,https://worldofbuzz.com/a-small-island-suddenly-emerges-in-indonesia-following-seroja-cyclone-thunderstorm/,"Share Tweet Follow us on Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, and Instagram for the latest stories and updates daily.

A new small island has suddenly emerged in the district of Loaholu in East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia last Wednesday (14 April 2021) after severe thunderstorm hit the region caused by the Seroja Tropical Cyclone. As reported by Indonesia News, local provincial authorities have begun to take note of the new island which is yet to be identified.

Previously, several videos have shown locals visiting the small island which is filled with sand that wasn’t there prior to the Seroja Cyclone. The length of the small island is approximately 500 metres. Josef Nae Soi, the governor of East Nusa Tenggara during a news conference commented,

“There was land that suddenly appeared as if on top of the ocean.”

However, the governor further clarified that more study must be made before concluding what the land actually is. According to a report by Kompas, the appearance of the new island is the subject of many speculations and a geological study must be made on the phenomenon.

A spokesman of the East Nusa Tenggara regional government, Marius Ardu Jelamu clarified that the new island is yet to be officially reported by the local authorities there and that he only knew about it through news reports. He further commented that one theory regarding the new island is that it was born as a result of huge waves and tornado when Seroja Cyclone hit.

Marius added,

“Maybe when the tornado hit, a void was created on the ocean floor leading to land residue to be brought over and filling the void.”

Hence, the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) will be conducting research on the new island to solve the mystery of its birth.

What do you guys think of this phenomenon? What do you reckon caused the creation of this new small island? Share your thoughts with us in the comments!

0,Czechia expelled all Russian ambassadors due to the explosion of ammunition depots,https://praguemorning.cz/czech-republic-expels-18-russian-diplomats/,"The Czech Republic says it will expel 18 Russian diplomats, alleging that Russian intelligence officers – all those identified as SVR and GRU agents.

Prime Minister Andrej Babis said Saturday that the Czech intelligence agencies provided clear evidence about the involvement of Russian military agents in the explosion of 50 tonnes of munitions at a depot in Vrbětice in October 2014 in which two people died.

Czech police’s organised crime unit had worked on the case for several years in cooperation with the BIS counterintelligence service and the Brno Regional Public Prosecutor’s Office.

“The explosion led to huge material damage and posed a serious threat to the lives of many local people, but above all it killed two of our fellow citizens, fathers of families,” Babis said.

Babis added the Czech Republic is a sovereign state and must react to those findings.

Interior Minister Jan Hamacek, who is also serving as the foreign minister, said those 18 Russian embassy staffers were clearly identified as Russian military spies and were ordered to leave the country within 48 hours.

Hamacek said he had summoned Russian ambassador Alexander Zmeyevsky on Saturday evening to tell him about the decision.

In 2014, a series of blasts took place in the munitions depot at Vrbětice in south Moravia. Two people were killed.

The warehouses were leased by the Ostrava company Imex Group. Police are investigating the explosion as a deliberate general threat.

Česko vyhostí 18 zaměstnanců ruské ambasády. Existuje důvodné podezření ze zapojení důstojníků ruské tajné služby GRU do výbuchů muničních skladů ve Vrběticích. Oceňuji práci našich bezpečnostních složek, policie a zejména NCOZ na odhalení této bezprecedentní skandální akce. — Andrej Babiš (@AndrejBabis) April 17, 2021

Czech police officers simultaneously seek two Russian nationals who used passports registered to Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov. (While in the country, the men later switched to Moldovan passports under different names.)

The individuals’ photographs, shared online by the Czech police, indicate that the two wanted men are the same suspected Russian intelligence agents accused of trying to assassinate Sergey Skripal and his daughter in England in March 2018.

Following the attack in England, investigative journalists identified Petrov and Boshirov as aliases for Russian military intelligence officers named Alexander Mishkin and Anatoly Chepiga. The statement from the Czech police does not mention the attack against the Skripals.

Europe on alert as Russia steps up aggressive spying

From Austria to Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden, Russian diplomats have been expelled from several European countries in the past few months over Moscow’s increasingly aggressive spying tactics. On Thursday, Poland said it had expelled three Russian diplomats for “carrying out activities to the detriment” of Poland.",444,2920,12,82

A diplomatic source cited by Interfax suggested the expulsions could prompt Russia to shut the Czech Republic's embassy in Moscow.

""There is well-grounded suspicion about the involvement of officers of the Russian intelligence service GRU... in the explosion of [an] ammunitions depot in the Vrbetice area,"" Babis told a briefing shown live on television.

Hamacek said 18 Russian embassy staff identified as secret service personnel would be ordered to leave the NATO country within 48 hours.

Several explosions shook the Vrbetice ammunition depot, 330km southeast of Prague, on October 16, 2014. They killed two employees of a private company that was renting the depot from a state military organisation.

The Czech Republic said Sunday it had informed NATO and European Union allies that it suspected Russia of causing the blast, and European Union foreign ministers were set to discuss the matter at their meeting on Monday.

A NATO official said that the alliance would support the Czech Republic as it investigated Russia's ""malign activities"", which were part of a pattern of ""dangerous behaviour"".

""Those responsible must be brought to justice,"" added the official, who declined to be named.

British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab tweeted that the Czechs ""have exposed the lengths that the GRU will go to in their attempts to conduct dangerous and malign operations"".

Washington also offered Prague its support.

The Interfax news agency cited Vladimir Dzhabarov, first deputy head of the upper house's international affairs committee, as saying Prague's claims were absurd and Russia's response should be proportionate.

The expulsions prompted Russia’s Foreign Ministry to vow on Sunday to ""force the authors of this provocation to fully understand their responsibility for destroying the foundation of normal ties between our countries"".

Moscow took the first steps Sunday by summoning the Czech ambassador in Russia to the foreign ministry.

The row is the biggest between Prague and Moscow since the end of decades of Soviet domination of eastern Europe in 1989.

Separately, Czech police said on Saturday they were searching for two men carrying various passports, including Russian ones in the names of Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov. The men are wanted for their potential role in the 2014 explosion, the organised crime squad (NCOZ) said on its website.

Those names were the aliases used by two Russian military intelligence officers who British prosecutors charged with the attempted murder on British soil of Russian spy Sergei Skripal.

They and Moscow both denied involvement.

Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with a nerve agent in the English city of Salisbury in March 2018.

The attack prompted the biggest wave of diplomatic expulsions between Moscow and the West since the Cold War.

Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) failed to choose Nigeria for its first African office because the media misrepresents the country, its information minister said on Thursday, citing coverage of police reform protests last year.

The social media giant on Monday said it would set up its first office on the continent in neighbouring Ghana, as the company seeks to make inroads in some of the world's fastest-growing markets. read more

Nigeria, Africa's biggest economy, has a thriving technology sector that has attracted international investors but faces numerous security challenges including a decade-long Islamist insurgency in the northeast, mass abductions from schools in the northwest and piracy in the Gulf of Guinea.

Rights group Amnesty said soldiers and police shot dead at least 12 people on Oct. 20 after largely peaceful protests calling for police reforms in the wake of alleged brutality turned violent. The military and police deny the allegations.

""This is what you get when you de-market your own country,"" Information Minister Lai Mohammed told reporters, in a video posted on Twitter by his ministry, when asked about Twitter's decision.

""Nigerian journalists were...painting Nigeria as a hell where nobody should live,"" he said of coverage of the protests in which Twitter users coalesced behind the #EndSARS hashtag in reference to the widely feared Special Anti-Robbery Squad that was disbanded after abuse allegations surfaced.

""The natural expectation would have been for Nigeria to be the hub for Twitter in this part of Africa,"" said Mohammed.

In the weeks before the shootings, protesters used social media to organise, raise money and share what they said was proof of police harassment. Twitter's CEO, Jack Dorsey, tweeted to encourage his followers to contribute to the protests using bitcoin.

Mohammed, days after the circulation of images, video and an Instagram live feed of the incident, said ""some form of regulation"" could be imposed on social media to combat ""fake news"".

Twitter described Ghana as ""a champion for democracy"" and ""a supporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet"".

0,"In its latest lurch to the far right, Denmark plans to send refugees back to Syria",https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/18/europe/denmark-syrian-refugees-damascus-intl/index.html,"They did not speak a word of Danish yet the Scandinavian country was an outpost of calm for the siblings, who fled the destruction and death that followed the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011.

""I can hardly remember anything but war in Syria,"" Dania, 22, told CNN of her time growing up on the outskirts of the country's capital, Damascus. She said what drew her family of five to Denmark was its reputation for welcoming refugees -- being the first country in the world to sign the United Nations Refugee Convention in 1951.

On arriving in 2015, it only took them a year to learn the language, and now Dania is months away from finishing high school in the Danish port of Kolding. ""We were very happy at the beginning and felt safe being here,"" Dania, who hopes to work in bio-medicine, said. ""We [wanted] a good future, therefore we did everything [we could] to learn Danish.""

The siblings asked CNN to withhold their last name due to concerns for family members back in Syria.

Hussam, 20, described Denmark as a place of peace, a country where his family felt at home, and ""a society that gives you the freedom to live the way you want."" He hoped to study engineering or medicine once he completed high school next year.

Those dreams were dashed when Denmark became the first democratic European nation to tell Syrian refugees originating from Damascus and its surrounding countryside to return to the war-torn nation.

In 2019, the Danish government began reviewing the residency permits of refugees who came from Damascus -- a move based on its assessment that the conditions there had improved and it was therefore safe for refugees to return. In February, it was announced they were also reviewing the status of several hundred Syrian refugees from Damascus' surrounding region.

But critics say the policy of stripping Syrians of residency permits is the latest salvo aimed at Denmark's non-White refugee and immigrant community. While fighting has subsided considerably in the region around Damascus, activists say the Danish government is actively putting Syrians in harm's way.

""We disagree with the decision to deem the Damascus area, or any other area [in Syria], safe for refugees,"" Charlotte Slente, the secretary general of the Danish Refugee Council, told CNN.

""We have knowledge from various reports of arbitrary detention and ongoing civil rights abuses of the civilian population in Syria,"" she added, citing a March Human Rights Council report , which found that the Syrian government's policy and acts ""amount to crimes against humanity [and] have continued unabated for nearly 10 years, without any sign that the government intends to discontinue them.""

The Danish minister for immigration and integration, Mattias Tesfaye, defended the policy in a statement to CNN, saying that ""Denmark has been open and honest from day one"" that residence permits for Syrian refugees are ""temporary, and that the permit can be revoked if the need for protection ceases to exist.""

""The approach of the Danish government is to provide protection to those in need of it, but when the conditions in their home country have improved, former refugees should return to the home country and reestablish their life there,"" Tesfaye added.

Dania and Hussam's family have been caught in the dragnet. The Danish Immigration Service uprooted their lives in February by refusing to extend their father's residency permit, which their own visas are linked to, according to their lawyer Daniel Nørrung. Dania and Hussam had been told to leave Denmark by March 5, but with the help of a lawyer, the family is challenging the decision with the Refugee Appeals Board.

""It's a bit problematic, Dania and Hussam were given a date to leave Denmark when their father's case has not even been finalized,"" Nørrung told CNN.

If the appeals board upholds the immigration service's decision, the family will be stripped of their rights to study, work or live in the country. This mean they risk being sent to one of two deportation facilities -- known as ""departure centers"" -- for people who have been refused asylum and refugees like them who have lost their status.

""We are going to languish in a center, where people are broken down, humiliated and held in helplessness and hopelessness, instead of being able to go out and contribute to society,"" Dania said.

A small group of people in Copenhagen Central Station wait to welcome Syrian refugees on September in 2015.

Uprooting lives

The Danish government has refused to extend the residency permits of least 300 Syrian refugees since 2019, after its security assessment concluded that the situation in Damascus was ""no longer so serious.""

Authorities are currently reexamining the protection of more than 400 more Syrian refugees living in the country, according to figures given to CNN by the Ministry of Immigration and Integration.

This is part of a self-described paradigm shift of Danish refugee policy, said Nikolas Feith Tan, a refugee law expert at the Danish Institute of Human Rights.

The move has seen successive governments enact legislative amendments that have shifted the country's focus from the integration and permanent protection of refugees to the kind of temporary residency permits Dania and Hussam were placed under.

In January, the country's left-wing Social Democrat Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen reiterated her party's intention to be as restrictive on immigration as her right-wing predecessors, telling parliament the goal was to have ""zero asylum seekers."" Frederiksen adopted a hardline stance on immigration in the run-up to Denmark's 2019 election, luring voters away from the right-wing populist Danish People's Party (DPP).

After winning the election, the Social Democrat party is ""locked in now"" to prove it is not soft on immigration, or it risks drawing the ire of right-wing parties or the electorate, Kristina Bakkær Simonsen, an associate professor at Aarhus University, who specializes in immigrant integration, discrimination and stigmatization, told CNN.

While the Danish government ""cannot carry out forced returns"" as it does not have diplomatic relations with Syria, ""the government's clear hope is that this group of people will choose to return voluntarily, which some Syrians already have done,"" Tan added.

To help with the move ""a bag of money from the Danish state"" is provided to the voluntary Syrian returnees, the immigration and integration minister Tesfaye has said . His ministry told CNN the financial support is around $28,150, and since 2019 more than 250 Syrian refugees have taken the financial support package.

But activists say Syrians are being compelled to return by the Danish government's efforts to make life intolerable for those without residency rights. The deportation centers Dania and Hussam dread entering ""are like torture, designed to break people down,"" Michala Clante Bendixen, the head of Refugees Welcome Denmark, told CNN.

The centers are partially open, which means their occupants are able to move in and out freely, said Bendixen. But the occupants have to check in every evening, and have no income, rights to employment or access to public housing. One center is around four miles from the nearest bus stop, making it impossible for anyone to leave in the day.

""There are no activities, no training courses, you can't even cook your own food,"" Bendixen said, noting that even in prison there are opportunities to make money. Instead of returning to their country of origin, refugees sometimes ""go underground"" and flee to other European countries ""where they will try and reopen their asylum cases,"" Bendixen said.

Targeting immigrants and refugees

In 2018, Denmark's government struck a deal to move ""unwanted"" migrants to a remote uninhabited island once used for contagious animals. The plan was later scrapped.

In recent years, Denmark has rolled out some of the harshest anti-immigrant policies in Europe, including a so-called jewelry bill that allows the government to take certain assets from asylum seekers to contribute to the country's welfare state.

In 2017, the former Liberal Party immigration minister Inger Stojberg celebrated the passage of another law that tightened immigration controls with cake. The following year, a decade-old proposal by the right-wing populist DPP to ban face coverings in public came into force, essentially criminalizing Muslim women who wear the niqab or burqa.

In 2019, the government forced social and ethnic change in 15 low-income housing estates across the country -- which it called ""hard ghettos"" and which Danish regulations define partly according to the races of residents.

This year, the authorities said it would drop the term ""ghetto"" but expand the law to prevent the growth of such enclaves. The aim is that by the end of the decade, ""residents with non-Western backgrounds"" can only comprise up to 30% of any neighborhood in Denmark, according to a press release from the Interior and Housing Ministry.

""For far too many years, we have closed our eyes to the development that was underway, and only acted when the integration problems became too great,"" housing minister Kaare Dybvad Bek said in a statement. ""We will do this by preventing more vulnerable housing areas and by creating more mixed housing areas throughout Denmark.""

But the government is not succeeding in escaping the scrutiny that ""they are trying to avoid by renaming ghetto areas, when they keep prioritizing ethnicity as the prime criterion"" of these policies, Simonsen told CNN.

'Copying the far right'

Critics say the governing coalition, which is led by the Social Democrats, is copying the language of the Danish far right.

""Denmark is strong when it comes to rights and solidarity; burden sharing and economic equality; fair governance and no corruption,"" Bendixen said. ""In that way, it is very surprising and very paradoxical we have this growing xenophobia and also managed to make ... clearly discriminatory laws"" for refugees and immigrants, she said.

Some maintain that, at its core, Denmark's identity is tied to its White heritage -- something reflected in official statistics, which divides the population into three categories: ""persons of Danish origins,"" ""immigrants,"" and ""descendants of immigrants."" This means that second-generation immigrants, who are naturalized Danish citizens, are not counted officially in the Danish category.

In 2019, new legislation compelled housing associations to sell or redevelop 40% of public housing stock in low-rent, ethnic minority enclaves.

Last year, the immigration and integration minister Tesfaye announced a new classification for people from primarily Muslim countries. The category, called MENAPT, will include people from or with heritage from Middle Eastern and North African countries as well as Pakistan and Afghanistan.

""It will provide a clearer picture of how people from 24 countries, primarily in the Middle East and North Africa, who have played a major role in immigration to Denmark, cope in relation to, for example, crime and employment,"" a government statement wrote.

What it shows, Bendixen said, is that there appears to be ""two sets of laws"" in Denmark: ""One set for 'the real Danes,' and one set for the 'others who don't belong here.'""

While analysts have noted that Danish political discourse on immigrants is extremely negative compared to other European countries, the policy of removing the refugee status of Syrians has been controversial in the country.

The plight of young Danish-speaking Syrians have filled the pages of the country's largest broadsheets and Facebook groups have been set up to campaign for them to remain.

The action has also made the country an outlier among its closest allies. In March, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the UN Security Council that it was ""not in the interest of the Syrian people to pressure Syrian refugees to return to Syria, including to regime-held areas, where many fear they will be arbitrary detained, tortured, or even killed by Assad's security forces in retaliation for fleeing.""

""We agree with the UN that refugee returns must be voluntary, well-informed, and should ensure the safety and dignity of the people involved -- or else they should not happen,"" Blinken added.

But Denmark does not appear to be reconsidering the move. ""The government's policy is working, and I won't back down, it won't happen,"" immigration minister Tesfaye told Agence France Presse. In a statement to CNN he pointed to reports by the UK Home Office , the European Union's Asylum Office and the Swedish government that said the security situation in Damascus had improved.

However, neither of those nations are repatriating Syrians to the Damascus region, while the EU does not recommend doing so.

All Hussam and Dania want to do is remain in Denmark. But instead of worrying about exams and other everyday concerns like their Danish friends, the siblings now fear their family may face repercussions on returning to Syria for ""turning our backs"" against the regime. Hussam also stands the risk of being conscripted into the Syrian army, he said.

""Syria is not safe, and will not be safe no matter what city it is, as long as a dictator rules it,"" he said.",2145,13301,16,82

0,Mi’kmaq fisher argues feds becoming more aggressive in seizures of Indigenous gear,https://ckpgtoday.ca/2021/04/15/mikmaq-fisher-argues-feds-becoming-more-aggressive-in-seizures-of-indigenous-gear/,"The Indigenous band has cited Supreme Court of Canada rulings, including the Sparrow case in 1990, as affirmations of the Mi’kmaq practice of harvesting fish for ceremonies, food and gatherings.

Last fall, Syliboy was among the more prominent Mi’kmaq fishers who attempted to launch a self-regulated lobster fishery off southwest Nova Scotia. One of his vessels caught fire at the wharf and was damaged beyond repair.

The federal Fisheries Department says it believes existing law means Sipekne’katik requires a communal licence for fishing snow crab under provisions of the federal Fisheries Act. Spokeswoman Megan Gallant said by email that the band doesn’t have such a licence.

The department says on its website that it retains the right to regulate Indigenous fisheries for conservation purposes under both the Sparrow decision and the more recent Donald Marshall Jr. decision, which allowed Indigenous fishing in pursuit of a moderate livelihood.

Gallant said on Wednesday that fishery officers first warned Syliboy against fishing in an April 6 phone call, and that his snow crab traps were seized the following weekend.

“These operations are part of routine gear inspections by fishery officers to ensure compliance with the Fisheries Act and associated regulations,” she wrote.

Syliboy said he disagrees with the federal interpretation of the Supreme Court’s rulings, arguing he retains the right to operate without a federally approved licence if his band has authorized him to fish.

As the possibility of another season of unrest off southwestern Nova Scotia approaches, the fisher said he believes the enforcement action signals Ottawa will not tolerate self-regulated Indigenous fisheries.

“The (coast guard vessel) was very close to my vessel. It was more intimidation than anything, I think. They were on a 100-foot vessel doing circles around me,” he said.

“I believe it’s getting worse for Mi’kmaq fishers and not better. It’s becoming harder to access waters.”

Syliboy said he would be pleased to go to court and argue against the seizures, as he feels existing judicial rulings support his view.

However, Colin Sproul, a spokesman for the Unified Fisheries Conservation Alliance — a lobby group representing various non-Indigenous, commercial fishers — said Ottawa’s right to regulate remains a key part of Supreme Court of Canada decisions.

“The Sparrow decision is very clear that the right of First Nations are administered through the federal government and the minister, and that she has the ultimate authority for conservation,” he said.

Asked whether setting 10 traps for a community feast poses a conservation issue, Sproul responded, “there is a conservation issue on every single pound of fish taken out of the ocean.” He said all uses of the resource need to be accounted for “so that all the participants can make responsible management decisions.”

About a dozen cases have been reported in recent days, with at least five evacuees staying in two homes and one shelter testing positive, exposing at least 20 people to the virus, said Dr. Simone Keizer-Beache, chief medical officer on the Caribbean island.

'HUGE' EXPLOSION ROCKS ST. VINCENT AS VOLCANO KEEPS ERUPTING

Keizer-Beache said officials are preparing to do massive testing as part of contact tracing, a complicated undertaking given that between 16,000 to 20,000 people were evacuated before La Soufriere’s explosive eruptions started on Friday. She also urged people to keep wearing masks and asked them to cooperate, noting that some who arrive at shelters do not want to be tested, which is voluntary.

""Let us work together to prevent a second catastrophe,"" she said in a press conference broadcast by local station NBC Radio.

Complicating efforts to fight COVID-19 is the lack of water in some communities given the heavy ashfall, with people walking or driving to spigots with buckets and jugs in hand as long lines formed.

Among those in line was Suzanne Thomas, a 46-year-old saleswoman from South Union, a community in eastern St. Vincent that has been hit with water shortages since Saturday. She had welcomed nine evacuees into her home who are huddled together, sleeping only on rugs and blankets.

""It’s real rough. We have to use one jug of water to shower, brush your teeth and flush the toilet,"" she said, laughing as she added: ""Water conservation.""

Others, like 17-year-old Kevin Sam, said they’ve had no water at all since Saturday: ""I’m glad that these stand pipes are available, ’cause I don’t know what we would’ve done. It’s not easy to bathe with half a bucket.""

Meanwhile, supplies were non-existent or running low at some government shelters.

Lisa May, 36, said she and her three children were sleeping on the floor at a shelter in the capital of Kingstown and hoped they would soon have at least one mattress to share: ""Any little help we get, we (would be) grateful.""

More than 4,000 people are staying in 89 government shelters. Meanwhile, the government so far has registered more than 6,000 evacuees in private homes, a number that keeps growing, said Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves.

He said he worries about an uptick in COVID-19 cases in certain areas given dwindling water supplies or complete lack of water.

VOLCANO ERUPTION IN CARIBBEAN PROMOPTS MASS EVACUATION DURING POPULAR VACATION WEEK

""If we’re not careful, we’re going to have a spike, which could create a real danger in addition to what we’re having with the volcano,"" he said. ""Washing your hands when you don’t have a lot of water is problematic.""

Garth Saunders, director of St. Vincent’s utilities company, said crews are still cleaning intakes of the island’s water and sewer system and expected water to reach more communities later Thursday, adding that ashfall has been very heavy. Neighboring islands and organizations also have shipped water to St. Vincent, where officials have distributed water bottles and dispatched water trucks.

Long lines formed at those trucks and at money transfer companies, with some standing for hours to retrieve cash from loved ones.

""I’ve been here since 4:30 this morning,"" said Joseph King, a 67-year-old plumber, adding that he was tired and hungry.

La Soufriere is expected to keep erupting for days or even weeks, with a scientific team expected on Thursday to estimate the amount of gases expelled by the volcano and gather samples of pyroclastic flow material. Those analysis will tell scientists how the volcano is behaving and help them guess what it’s likely to do in the future, said Richard Robertson, who is leading the team for the University of the West Indies’ Seismic Research Center.

The volcano had a minor eruption in December, and prior to that erupted in 1979. A previous eruption in 1902 killed some 1,600 people.",711,4323,12,82
0,Italy: Former Interior Minister Salvini to Stand Trial Over Migrant Crysis in 2019,https://www.novinite.com/articles/209002/Italy%3A+Former+Interior+Minister+Salvini+to+Stand+Trial+Over+Migrant+Crysis+in+2019,"A judge in Sicily on Saturday ordered former interior minister Matteo Salvini to stand trial for having refused to let a Spanish migrant rescue ship dock in an Italian port in 2019, keeping the people at sea for days.

Judge Lorenzo Iannelli set September 15 as the trial date during a hearing in the Palermo bunker courtroom, the LaPresse news agency reported.

Mr Salvini, who attended the hearing, confirmed the outcome and insisted he was only doing his job and his duty by refusing entry to the Open Arms rescue ship and the 147 people it had rescued in the Mediterranean.

Citing the Italian constitution, Mr Salvini tweeted that defending the country was the “sacred duty” of every Italian.

Palermo prosecutors have accused Mr Salvini of dereliction of duty and kidnapping, for having kept the migrants at sea off the coast of Lampedusa for days in August 2019.

During the standoff, some of the migrants threw themselves overboard in desperation as the captain pleaded for a safe, close port.

Eventually after a 19-day ordeal, the remaining 83 migrants still on board were allowed to disembark in Lampedusa.

Mr Salvini had maintained a hard line on migration as interior minister during the first government of premier Giuseppe Conte, from 2018-2019.

While demanding European Union nations do more to take in migrants arriving in Italy, Mr Salvini argued that humanitarian rescue ships were only encouraging Libya-based traffickers and that his policy actually saved lives by discouraging the risky trips across the Mediterranean.

His lawyer, Giulia Bongiorno, said she was certain the court would eventually determine that there was no kidnapping involved.

Open Arms, for its part, hailed the decision to put Mr Salvini on trial.

“We are happy for all the people we have rescued … in all these years,” the group tweeted.

The group’s founder, Oscar Camps, said the decision to prosecute was “historic”, showing that European political leaders can be held accountable for failing to respect the human rights of migrants.

“This trial is a reminder to Europe and the world that there are principles of individual responsibility in politics,” Mr Camps told a press conference Saturday.

The decision to prosecute shows “it’s possible to identify the responsibility of the protagonists of this tragedy at sea”.

Mr Salvini is also under investigation for another, similar migrant standoff involving the Italian coastguard ship Gregoretti that he refused to let dock in the summer of 2019.

The prosecutor in that case, Andrea Bonomo, recommended last week that Mr Salvini not be put on trial, arguing that he was carrying out government policy when he kept the 116 migrants at sea for five days.",441,2707,13,82

The social media company joins Facebook and other tech companies moving into Africa.

“Africa will define the future,” Twitter’s founder, Jack Dorsey, said in 2019 after a visit to Nigeria, Ghana, Ethiopia and South Africa.

Dorsey’s tweet announcing news of the hires on Monday said: “Twitter is now present on the continent.”

The jobs advertised in Ghana include positions for engineering, marketing and communications specialists.

“Today, in line with our growth strategy, we’re excited to announce that we are now actively building a team in Ghana,” the company said in a statement.

Twitter said its new team members would be working remotely under work-from-home policies while it explored “the opportunity to open an office in Ghana in the future”.

Ghana’s support for free speech and online freedoms made it the company’s choice for its first African location, Twitter said.

It added that the secretariat of the African Continental Free Trade Area base in the Ghanaian capital, Accra, had played a part in the decision.

Ghana’s President Nana Akufo-Addo said in a tweet that the country would be the location of Twitter’s headquarters on the continent, although this information was not included in the company’s statement.

Chile raises hopes vaccines, lockdowns are turning tide against COVID-19",https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/past-peak-chile-raises-hopes-vaccines-lockdowns-are-turning-tide-against-covid-2021-04-15/?taid=6078bc22c18bb900010d1765&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter,"A woman receives a vaccine as part of the seasonal flu vaccination campaign for children and elderly people, during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, in Santiago, Chile April 13, 2021.

Chile's health authorities said on Thursday they believed a dip in the record case numbers the Andean nation has seen over the past week represents a ""stabilization"" of a second COVID-19 wave thanks to strict lockdowns and a rapid vaccination program that has fully innoculated a third of the population.

Health minister Enrique Paris told reporters he hoped the 9,000 record daily cases reached last week represented the peak of the latest outbreak.

""Once we reach that peak, we expect not a reduction but a stabilization and then a return to smaller numbers of positive patients,"" he said.

Chile has now vaccinated 50% of its 15 million-strong target population with at least one dose of the Pfizer or Sinovac-developed drugs, and given 32.7% two doses, Paris said.

He said stricter lockdowns now covering more than 80% of the country, coupled with public awareness campaigns, should allow Chile to hold elections on May 15 to pick constituents to draft a new constitution as well as local government officials. The election was postponed from April.

Chile's experience of the pandemic is being watched anxiously by many beyond its borders to see how much its vaccination campaign - one of the world's fastest and most extensive to date - will mitigate successive waves of the virus.

On Friday, it will become one of the first countries in the world to release ""real world"" data showing how effective the vaccines have been in reducing contagion, serious illness and death.

Health experts remain divided on whether the lockdowns and vaccines will be enough to curb the second wave imminently or whether fresh strains of the virus, limited vaccine efficiency and citizen defiance of sanitary measures will continue to drive the numbers higher.

Paula Daza, the country's top public health official, said the vaccines were already reducing contagion rates and hospital admissions of older groups who were innoculated first.

""People under 50 represent 65% of confirmed (COVID-19) cases and 41% of those being hospitalized,"" she said.

Claudia Reyes, a 38-year-old ICU nurse at Santiago's Workers' Hospital, said they had seen an ""exponential"" increase in cases of largely younger patients.

She said fatigue or indifference to the lockdowns was evident among the general population, despite daily broadcasts about the severity of the second wave.

""There are so many people on the streets, on public transport,"" she said. ""It feels like last year the population was better contained but this time, regardless of the COVID situation, that there are fewer or no hospital beds left, people's awareness is not in keeping with the reality.""

0,India Covid: Thousands gather for dung-throwing festival as cases top 200k in a day,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9473727/India-Covid-Thousands-gather-dung-throwing-festival-cases-200k-day.html/,"India's two biggest cities have been shutdown amid spiralling Covid infections which saw a record 200,000 new cases on Thursday.

Patients have been packed two to a bed at one hospital in Delhi, where, along with Mumbai, stringent new lockdown rules have been imposed to curb the spread.

The soaring deaths and cases come just months after India thought it had seen the worst of the pandemic - and have forced the country to delay exports of vaccines abroad.

Despite the perilous situation, footage has emerged of villagers in Andhra Pradesh hurling cow dung at each other as part of religious celebrations.

Similar recent mass gatherings, including hundreds of thousands bathing in the Ganges, have been blamed for being 'super-spreader' events.

At Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital (LNJP) in Delhi, one of India's largest COVID-only facilities with more than 1,500 beds, a stream of ambulances ferried patients to the overflowing casualty ward on Thursday.

Thousands of villagers gathered in Kairuppala, a village in southern India, on Wednesday to take part in an annual festival where participants pelt each-other with cow dung (pictured)

The festival, which is supposed to guarantee peace, good health and prosperity, was allowed to go ahead despite India's soaring Covid second wave

India reported 200,739 new cases of Covid on Thursday amid a rapidly-spreading second wave of Covid that doctors fear is being driven by a new mutation

Deaths are also beginning to spike and have remained above 1,000 for two days in a row, with medics fearful that they are fighting a more-deadly version of the disease

Some also arrived in buses and three-wheeled autorickshaws.

The youngest patient was a new-born baby.

'We are definitely over-burdened. We are already working at full capacity,' said the hospital's medical director, Suresh Kumar.

From an initial 54 beds, the hospital now has over 300 for COVID-19 patients in critical condition. Even that is not enough.

Unrelated patients share beds, while bodies of the recently deceased lie outside the ward before being taken to the mortuary.

'Today we have 158 admissions in Lok Nayak alone,' Kumar said. Almost all were severe cases.

Delhi announced stay-at-home orders for the weekend, though essential workers will be able to move about if they have a pass from local authorities.

Restaurants, malls, gyms and spas will be shut down. Movie theaters will close on weekends, but can operate on weekdays at a third of their capacity.

Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi's top elected official, said that despite rise in infections, 5,000 hospital beds are still available in the capital and more capacity is being added.

But still, more than a dozen hotels and wedding banquet halls were ordered to be converted into COVID-19 centres where doctors from nearby hospitals will treat the moderately ill.

'The surge is alarming,' said S.K. Sarin, a government health expert in New Delhi.

The moves in the capital came after similar measures were imposed in the worst-hit state of Maharashtra, home to financial capital, Mumbai.

The bustle of India's biggest city ebbed after authorities closed most industries, businesses and public places Wednesday night and put limits on the movement of people for 15 days. Train and plane travel was still allowed, however.

In recent days, the city has seen an exodus of panic-stricken day laborers, hauling backpacks and flocking to overcrowded trains.

Dozens of other towns and cities have also imposed nighttime curfews.

The surge in cases was weighing on hospitals in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and several other states, where many reported a shortage of oxygen tanks. Imran Sheikh, a resident of the city of Pune in Maharashtra, said he was asked to supply his own oxygen tank for a relative undergoing COVID-19 treatment.

Cremation and burial grounds in the worst-hit areas were finding it difficult to cope with the increasing number of bodies arriving for last rites, according to Indian media reports.

Shahid Jamil, a virologist, said the recent local and state elections with massive political rallies and a major Hindu festival during which hundreds of thousands of devotees bathed in the Ganges river were super-spreader events.

Today new footage emerged of the dung-throwing event - known as pidakala samara - taking place in the village of Kairuppala, in Andhra Pradesh - the day after lunar new year celebrations.

It marks a mythological marriage dispute between two deities which was resolved by village elders, according to legend, and villagers believe that re-enacting the dispute and its peaceful conclusion each year will bring peace, health and prosperity.

The packed event was allowed to go ahead despite India's soaring Covid infection rate.

The 200,739 new infections recorded Thursday are about twice the number of daily cases that were recorded during the last peak, in September.

The Health Ministry also reported 1,038 deaths from COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, pushing the toll over 173,000.

Participants in the festival are split into 'teams' along caste and religious lines - representing two side in a mythical marriage dispute - before battling with dung

Police said 100 people were injured during the fight (pictured, men with bruised faces) though none of them was seriously hurt

Dr Shashank Joshi, who is leading India's Covid response in hardest-hit city of Mumbai, described the soaring infections as a 'tsunami' that has caught the government completely unawares.

The health system is already close to be overwhelmed, he said, with hospitals pleading for supplies of key medicines including oxygen to keep patients alive.

Dr Joshi told The Guardian that the second wave is affecting both young and old, with even children - previously spared the worst affects of Covid - now being brought into hospital with severe infections.

It comes just two months after the government was toasting its own success in fighting Covid as cases and deaths appeared to be in decline - though medics warned at the time that patchy testing meant many were being missed.

While the new surge has not been fully explained, medics theorise that it could be down to a new variant of the disease which is both more infectious and more deadly.

Similar virus mutations in the UK, Brazil and South Africa sent cases and deaths soaring in those countries and forced governments to take tougher measures to combat the infections.

India has been slow to respond to the spike, with Maharashtra state - the worst-hit - the only one so-far ordered into lockdown, which began yesterday.

For the next 15 days only essential services will be allowed to operate, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said, while gatherings have been limited to four people and non-essential use of public transport outlawed.

Indian medical workers in the city of Mumbai, which has been hardest-hit by the Covid second wave, prepare a body for cremation on Tuesday

Health authorities in Mumbai say hospitals are running short of key supplies including oxygen as the city is overwhelmed by a wave of Covid

But mass gatherings have continued elsewhere unabated, with thousands of Hindu devotees gathering to pray on the banks of the Ganges earlier this week during the festival of Kumbh Mela.

And in Andhra Pradesh, New Year celebrations such as pidakala samara have been allowed to go ahead with no sign of social distancing or mask wearing.

The festival traces its origins back to a mythological marriage between two deities of different castes who wished to marry, sparking a war between people of the village.

Village elders eventually resolved the dispute and the marriage was solemnised, restoring peace to Kairuppa.

Each year, the village is divided along religious and caste lines and each side lines up to hurl cow dung cakes - which are made a month ahead of time - at the other.

After the fight is over, processions are led out and village elders ritually bless the marriage of Lord Veerabhadra Swamy and Kalika Devi which is thought to bring peace, health and prosperity to the village.

Police said 100 people were injured in this year's celebrations, though none were seriously hurt.

Other traditional New Year celebrations in Andhra Pradesh state include leading donkeys through a pond of sludge that is poured around a temple, before washing and adorning the animals, which are then worshipped.

In total, India has reported more than 14million cases of Covid - the world's second-highest total after the US.

The country has also recorded 173,000 deaths, the fourth highest total in the world, though experts warn that is almost certainly a gross underestimate.

It is thought that just 20 per cent of deaths in India are medically registered with an official cause of death given, with experts saying the true death toll could be two or three times the official figure.",1444,8897,14,83
0,Nasa picks Elon Musk’s SpaceX to build spacecraft to return humans to moon | SpaceX,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/apr/17/nasa-spacex-moon-spacecraft-elon-musk,"Nasa has chosen SpaceX to build the next-generation spacecraft that will return humans to the moon, further strengthening Elon Musk’s grip on the burgeoning public-private space industry.

The $2.9bn contract to build the lunar lander that will spearhead the Artemis program, Nasa’s ambitious project to return to the moon for the first time since the final Apollo mission in 1972, was announced on Friday.

“The Artemis lunar landing is a key piece to our moon-to-Mars strategy,” Steve Jurczyk, acting Nasa administrator, told reporters. “Today is a big step forward. This is an incredible time to be involved in human exploration for all humanity.”

Musk’s company is currently the only operation with the capability of launching astronauts from US soil. But Nasa’s decision to go with a sole contractor for its human landing system (HLS) raised eyebrows.

Traditionally, the agency has preferred to stimulate competition and protect against setbacks by keeping at least two contractors on the payroll.

This time, partly for budgetary reasons, Nasa chose to reject proposals by the Amazon tycoon Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin, a partnership with Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper; and the defense contractor Dynetics.

All three bids were chosen for the preliminary stages of the HLS project in 2020.

“Congrats to SpaceX, but [I’m] honestly shocked Nasa is going with a single provider here,” Casey Dreier, senior space policy adviser, said in a tweet. “Of course, SpaceX always acts as if it’s a constant competition with itself. And it’s 100% delivered on its capability and price promise so far.”

Dreier calculated that “if SpaceX pulls this off, the US will get a human-capable lunar landing system for 13% the price of Apollo era hardware”.

The Artemis program also includes the Space Launch System, the most powerful rocket ever built, and the Orion spacecraft that will ferry crews. The SpaceX bid features its Starship landing system, currently under development.

Nasa has said the Artemis program will land the first woman and the first person of color on the moon. The Trump administration directed the agency to achieve the goal by 2024 but the timeline slipped because of budget cuts.

Joe Biden’s request to Congress, announced earlier this month, seeks $24.7bn for Nasa, an increase of 6.3% on the previous year, including $6.9bn for Artemis.

After the retirement of the space shuttle fleet in 2011, the US was unable to launch humans into space for nine years. Now, SpaceX continues to press ahead with its human spaceflight program. Since May 2020 it has sent two crews to the International Space Station. A third mission, Crew 2, is set for launch on 22 April.",455,2810,15,83
0,43 people sent by AKP municipality to Germany for workshop never returned to Turkey,https://www.duvarenglish.com/43-people-sent-by-akp-municipality-to-germany-for-workshop-have-not-returned-to-turkey-news-57112,"Duvar English

Some 43 out of 45 people from Turkey who attended a workshop in Germany have never returned back to the country.

The organization was part of an initiative launched by the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) municipality in the eastern Malatya province's Yeşilyurt district.

The workshop named “Project to Raise Environmentally Conscientious People” was held by Mega Kilit GMBH in the German city of Hannover.

The incident became public when Yeşilyurt councilors from the main opposition Republican Peoples' Party (CHP) have submitted a motion to Mayor Mehmet Çınar, demanding answers from him.

Online media outlet Artı Gerçek contacted two of the workshop attendees who never came back to Turkey.

The two people on April 15 said that Turkish authorities had provided them with service (gray) passports for their September 2020 trip to Germany.

“We came last year, but visits are still continuing. Two weeks ago, two buses [from Turkey] came to Hamburg,” they said, adding that they now hold temporary residence permits in Germany.

As Turkish authorities have launched an investigation into the incident, reports suggested that the case was not limited to the Yeşilyurt municipality.

Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) Muazzez Orhan filed a parliamentary question inquiring about rumors that a similar incident happened at an initiative launched by the trustee municipality of Van's Tuşba district.

Orhan said that the Tuşba municipality had similarly on Jan. 7 taken a decision to send 55 people to Germany “in a nonprocedural way.” He said that this decision was adopted at the city council despite the objections of HDP councilors.

The HDP lawmaker asked Vice President Fuat Oktay if the Tuşba municipality had sent personnel or councilors to Germany for the purposes of raising “environmentally conscientious people.”

“If they have been sent, have all of them returned back to the country? If not, who are the 'runaways'?” he asked.",309,1966,14,83
0,"Macron says France ""finalizing"" plans to ease restrictions for vaccinated travelers",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/emmanuel-macron-covid-restrictions-france-face-the-nation/,"Washington — France is finalizing plans to lift restrictions for Americans traveling to the country who have received their COVID-19 vaccines, French President Emmanuel Macron said, as the nation grapples with another surge in coronavirus cases.

""We will progressively lift the restrictions of the beginning of May, which means that we will organize in the summer time with our professionals in France for French European citizens, but as well for American citizens,"" Macron said in an interview with ""Face the Nation"" that aired Sunday. ""So we are working hard to propose a very concrete solution, especially for U.S. citizens who are vaccinated, so with a special pass, I would say.""

France is currently in its third national lockdown as it battles another wave of coronavirus infections, with schools closed through the end of April, travel limited and gatherings prohibited. In a televised national address late last month, Macron attributed the latest surge to new coronavirus variants, which are more contagious and have created ""an epidemic within an epidemic.""

France's death toll from the coronavirus surpassed 100,000, and there have been more than 5.3 million confirmed cases, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Macron said Sunday that France's ministers are ""finalizing the technical discussions"" over easing the restrictions, and officials are crafting a certificate to facilitate travel between European countries with testing and vaccinations.

""The idea indeed is altogether to offer that to the American citizen when they decide to vaccinate or with a PCR test being negative,"" he said. ""So the idea is indeed to always control the virus, to maximize the vaccination and to progressively lift the restrictions.""

The most recent surge in coronavirus cases in France come as vaccinations in the country lag. But Macron said Europe is catching up, with production accelerated, positioning France to meet its vaccine targets. Still, some members of the European Union are considering securing their own supplies of Russia's Sputnik vaccine, which hasn't been approved by the European Medicines Agency yet.

Asked whether he would buy Russia's vaccine, Macron noted European health authorities haven't allowed it yet, so the vaccine cannot be used on French soil.

""At this stage, the Russian vaccine is not recognized by our authorities,"" he said. ""So I don't think that the Russian vaccine today is a solution to an acceleration because it will take time to have the authorization of the European agency and it will take time to produce on our continent such a vaccine.""

In addition to facilitating the vaccinations of French citizens, Macron said it is ""not sufficient just to be focused on the rich countries.""

""I think between now and June, we have to send a maximum doses of vaccine, which is a tiny part of what we get for us, to vaccinate the workers of the healthcare system in Africa,"" he said. ""It's very limited, but these guys are working hard to preserve the health system and this is something we can do. And same in Latin America. After summer, we will accelerate these deliveries. We will accelerate this solidarity. And on top of that, what we have to provide is financing as well for these economies.""",524,3243,11,83
0,"Alabama - Yoga can leave you injured, psychotic and a Hindu, Christian groups claim",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/17/alabama-yoga-ban-public-schools-christian-groups,"Jeremy Gray, a state lawmaker in Alabama, has been practicing yoga for years, initially as a workout after college football matches and later as a means of instilling in himself the virtues of focus and patience.

Now the Democrat from Opelika needs all the patience he can get as he seeks to overturn a 28-year yoga ban in Alabama public schools. The ban, believed to be the only statewide prohibition of its sort in America, is proving to be tougher to scrub from the statute books than might be expected.

Gray is preparing to present a bill to the Alabama senate that would allow public schools and students to engage in yoga during gym classes for the first time in almost three decades. The lifting of the ban was approved by the state house of representatives in March, and last week Gray’s bill passed out of the senate judiciary committee and now awaits a full debate and vote on the senate floor.

But the closer Gray’s vision comes to fruition, the more it draws enemy fire. The main hurdle to reform lies with conservative Christian groups who argue that just the mere act of allowing yoga in the classroom will expose kids to the risk of converting to Hinduism.

“Yoga is a very big part of the Hindu religion, and if this bill passes then instructors will be able to come into classrooms as young as kindergarten and bring these children through guided imagery, which is a spiritual exercise,” Becky Gerritson, director of the conservative Alabama Eagle told state senators recently.

The idea that yoga is a gateway drug to Hinduism strikes Gray as palpably ridiculous. He has practiced yoga for 10 years, yet remains a committed Christian worshipping in a Baptist church.

“The promoting of Hinduism argument is the only talking point these conservative groups have, and it makes them look very misinformed and miseducated on the issue,” Gray told the Guardian.

The lawmaker said that he was struck by the contrast between the view of teachers who were strongly in favor of lifting the ban so that schoolchildren could benefit from yoga’s ability to reduce anxiety and depression, and the conservatives who had never tried yoga and who had no direct connection to public schools who were opposing it.

“To me you cannot be well versed on something you never experienced. We have individuals opposing a bill that really doesn’t affect them, but those individuals in education are 100% behind it,” Gray said.

The lawmaker points to official statistics that show that one in seven Americans have had some experience of yoga. The federal public health agency the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of yoga and meditation in schools to reduce “those stressful feelings and increase your ability to remember things more clearly”.

But conservative groups are not giving up without a fight. The National Center for Law & Policy, an organization of Christian lawyers who take on legal cases backing anti-abortion, anti-gay marriage and other causes that they call “civil liberties”, has produced a factsheet claiming to prove that yoga cannot be separated from its religious roots in Hinduism.

“Yoga can be dangerous, causing injuries, death from stroke, and psychotic episodes,” the document says.

Nikunj Trivedi, president of the Coalition of Hindus of North America, said that the latest claims were just a new iteration of age-old discrimination against America’s 2.5 million Hindus. “These arguments are a reminder of the Hindu-phobia that existed in the US in the 19th and early 20th century, when Hindus were portrayed as strange cult followers out to alter your mind and get you to do crazy things. It’s sad to see such Hindu-phobia still persisting.”

HAVANA — Raul Castro said Friday he is resigning as head of Cuba's Communist Party, ending an era of formal leadership by he and his brother Fidel Castro that began with the 1959 revolution.

The 89-year-old Castro made the announcement Friday in a speech at the opening of the Eighth congress of the ruling party, the only one allowed on the island.

He said he was retiring with the sense of having ""fulfilled his mission and confident in the future of the fatherland.""

Castro didn't say who he would endorse as his successor as first secretary of the Communist Party. But he previously indicated that he favors yielding control to 60-year-old Miguel Diaz-Canel, who succeeded him as president in 2018 and is the standard bearer of a younger generation of loyalists who have been pushing an economic opening without touching Cuba's one-party system.

His retirement means that for the first time in more than six decades Cubans won't have a Castro formally guilding their affairs, and it comes at a difficult time, with many on the island anxious about what lies ahead.

The coronavirus pandemic, painful financial reforms and restrictions imposed by the Trump administration have battered the economy, which shrank 11% last year as a result of a collapse in tourism and remittances. Long food lines and shortages have brought back echoes of the ""special period"" that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s.

Discontent has been fueled by the spread of the internet and growing inequality.

Much of the debate inside Cuba is focused on the pace of reform, with many complaining that the so-called ""historic generation"" represented by Castro has been too slow to open the economy.

In January, Diaz-Canel finally pulled the trigger on a plan approved two congresses ago to unify the island's dual currency system, giving rise to fears of inflation. He also threw the doors open to a broader range of private enterprise — a category long banned or tightly restricted — permitting Cubans to legally operate many sorts of self-run businesses from their homes.

This year's congress is expected to focus on unfinished reforms to overhaul state-run enterprises, attract foreign investment and provide more legal protection to private business activities.

The Communist Party is made up of 700,000 activists and is tasked in Cuba's constitution with directing the affairs of the nation and society.

Fidel Castro, who led the revolution that drove dictator Fulgencio Batista from power in 1959, formally became head of the party in 1965, about four years after officially embracing socialism.

He quickly absorbed the old party under his control and was the country's unquestioned leader until falling ill inh 2006 and in 2008 handing over the presidency to his younger brother Raul, who had fought alongside him during the revolution.

Raul succeeded him as head of the party in 2011. Fidel Castro died in 2016.",483,2949,13,83

Tensions between the two nations have risen after Ukrainian diplomats called Russia’s growing army “the largest troop movement since the Second World War”. US President Joe Biden issued a warning on Thursday, urging Russian President Vladimir Putin to de-escalate tensions and “refrain from military action.”

In a statement, Mr Biden said: “If Russia continues to interfere with our democracy, I’m prepared to take further actions to respond. “Now is the time to de-escalate.” The US cancelled deployment of two warships to the Black Sea on April 14 in order to avoid an unnecessary escalation of the situation. The Kremlin had previously warned US warships to steer clear of Crimea “for their own good” and has closed part of the Kerch Strait in an attempt to block foreign warships from reaching Ukraine.

Sergeant Sasha Iovenko, a Ukrainian soldier on the front line of the Eastern border, told The Telegraph: “I can’t tell you what’s going through the heads of the political leaders in the Kremlin. “We can see the increase in the number of troops and equipment on our border but we cannot say for certain. We cannot make any kind of forecast.

General Tod Wolters, the top US military chief in Europe, warned on Thursday that there is a “low to medium” risk that Russia will invade Ukraine over the next few weeks. Three Ukrainian gunboats were almost forced to fire on Russian vessels on Thursday in the Azov sea after enemy ships performed “provocative manoeuvres.” Andrii Klymenko, a Ukrainian commentator, said: “Our sailors had to warn they were ready to use weapons.” The Ukrainian Government forecasts that around 40,000 troops and a plethora of advanced military-grade equipment has been amassed in Crimea and another 40,000 close to the Eastern Border.

The minister also regretted that the local handicraft industry could not be developed as a result. The government is taking steps to revive the batik industry, he added.

Among the plans to revive the local handicrafts industry is a proposal to provide incentives of SLR 5,000 to individuals. Local manufacturers will also be given the opportunity to supply fabrics for school and security uniforms. “We now have a great opportunity to take handloom textile and batik products manufactured in Sri Lanka to a great height,” the minister said.

Sri Lanka’s batik, handloom and apparel industry has set an export target of $6 billion for 2021. Exports in 2020 had dropped from $5.6 billion in 2019 to $4.4 billion for the year.

0,Man fined for farting in front of police argues it’s ‘freedom of expression’—reports,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1420010/man-fined-for-farting-in-front-of-police-argues-its-freedom-of-expression-reports,"A man who was fined €500 (around $600 or P29,000) last year for farting in front of police in Vienna, Austria, recently argued that it was a form of “freedom of expression.”

The man, whose identity was withheld, was able to lower his fine to €100 (around $120 or P5,800), as per Austrian newspaper Der Standard earlier this month as cited by The Local on April 9.

In challenging the fine, the man argued in court that farting is a “biological process” that even if intentional, it would amount to freedom of expression.

The Vienna Regional Administrative Court did not remove his fine, although it was lowered as the court acknowledged the man’s clean record and financial status. He was described to have only had “average” culpability of the offense, according to the report.

In the ruling, the court recalled that the farting incident occurred in June last year while he was sitting on a bench at a park, hanging out with friends.

The man, who was referred to only as Mr. AB in court documents, and his group were approached by police officers for a routine identity check, Vice reported in detail on April 14, also citing Der Standard.

“When he released the intestinal gas, the complainant was sitting on a park bench,” the document was quoted as stating. “He then lifted his buttocks and tensed up a little before letting the intestinal gas escape.”

“The complainant’s friends laughed at the intestinal gas and witness F made a joke. Due to the resulting entertainment from the intestinal gas, the defendant grinned at the officers,” it added.

While the judge did not approve of his argument and just lowered the fine to €100, Mr. AB’s lawyer, Matej Zenz, told local Viennese newspaper Kurier that they would appeal the decision before the country’s constitutional court.

Zenz maintained that it is “a matter of principle” to them, stressing that it is “petty to get a punishment for a fart.”

The court argues, however, that this specific farting incident is not a case of “pure body stimuli” as it was done so in a “form of expression that transcends the boundaries of decency,” The Local reported, citing Der Standard. Ian Biong /ra

0,No Clear Option For Montenegro As It Tries To Repay $1 Billion Highway Debt To China,https://www.rferl.org/a/montenegro-china-billion-debt-highway/31203309.html,"PODGORICA -- Montenegro says it needs help from the European Union to pay off a whopping $1 billion Chinese loan for a controversial road project that has left the Balkan country in a dire financial situation.

But EU spokeswoman Ana Pisonero told RFE/RL that the bloc ""does not repay loans from third parties,"" though she added that Brussels did have concerns over ""the socioeconomic and financial effects some of China's investments can have,"" as well as the risks of economic imbalances and ""debt dependency.""

She did say, however, that the EU was willing to offer support through its $10 billion Economic and Investment Plan for the Western Balkans. ""The Economic and Investment plan will help leverage funding from other public and private investors, including from the European Investment Bank at very favorable conditions,"" Pisonero said.

The long-delayed and still-incomplete highway finds itself at the heart of a wider geopolitical contest on the EU's doorstep, where China's influence in the Balkans has expanded dramatically in recent years.

The rebuffed call to Brussels for assistance comes as Montenegro faces a looming repayment deadline for the highway -- which is being built by the China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) -- and is grappling with a host of political and financial challenges, including a tourism-dependent economy that has contracted significantly due to the pandemic and weakened its repayment ability.

China holds approximately one-quarter of Montenegro's total debt, which reached 103 percent of GDP last year, and if Podgorica defaults on its loan the contract for the road project gives China the possibility to access land and assets in the Balkan country as collateral.

According to the current contract with the Export-Import Bank of China, the first loan payments are due in July.

The stakes are now high for both Brussels and Podgorica.

Montenegro must now search for other options for its financial future, while the EU must look for a way to shore up its standing in the Western Balkans, a region where China continues to improve its ties amid the pandemic by strategically donating vaccines and providing aid in a time of crisis.

""It's not a surprise to see where the project ended up, it was trouble in the making from the start,"" Vuk Vuksanovic, a researcher at the Belgrade Center for Security Policy, told RFE/RL.

Debt Politics

With debt help from the EU not on the table, the new Montenegrin government that was narrowly voted into power in December must find a new solution. The loan was taken out by a previous government led by current President Milo Djukanovic, who continues to be a long-term force in the country's politics.

Montenegro, which became an independent country again when it broke away from Serbia in 2006, joined NATO in 2017 and is working to get the green light to join the EU. Like many countries in the Balkans, it also has strong ties to Russia and has increasingly looked to China -- under the guise of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative -- for infrastructure and investment.

The current government of Prime Minister Zdravko Krivokapic has tried to distance itself from the highway project, raising concerns over being able to meet its debt obligations and tying the loan to its predecessors, who signed the deal in 2014.

Deputy Prime Minister Dritan Abazovic first publicly raised concerns in March, when he told Montenegrin lawmakers that the EU should help refinance the loan to protect the country from becoming dependent on China.

Montenegrin Finance Minister Milojko Spajic also joined the public effort, telling the Financial Times on April 11 that the EU helping the country with the Chinese loan was an ""easy win"" and ""low-hanging fruit"" for the bloc.

A Winding Road

Accepting the loan from the Export-Import Bank of China and building the highway was controversial from the very start. The project was designed to link the port of Bar on Montenegro's Adriatic coast to landlocked neighbor Serbia. The highway itself is divided into three sections, with the Chinese loan only covering the first 41 kilometers.

That stretch, which passes through mountains north of the capital, has been the most demanding, with an estimated 60 percent of it made up of bridges and tunnels. The first section of the highway is not yet completed, having faced planning problems and delays due to the pandemic. The government recently said it intended for the first section to be complete this year.

When the current government was the opposition it criticized the government for agreeing to the loan, raising concerns over the cost, a lack of transparency in the tender process, potential corruption, and the long-term economic risk it brought to the small Balkan country of 620,000.

Doubts about the highway first surfaced after two feasibility studies, conducted in 2006 and 2012, showed it was not economically viable. Montenegro had tried and failed to secure funding from European sources before it turned to China.

""Some projects haven't been built for a reason,"" Jonathan Hillman, the director of the Reconnecting Asia Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told RFE/RL. ""Just because financing becomes available it doesn't mean that it should be accepted.""

MANS, an EU-financed anti-corruption watchdog, also pressed the government at the time to provide lawmakers with data to support its vision and how the project would generate revenue before a vote to approve the Chinese-funded highway in 2014. But the government refused to do so and many details around the contract for the loan remain hidden.

Even before the current problems posed by the debt repayment deadline, the Chinese loan caused economic pain to the country, forcing the government to raise taxes and partially freeze public-sector wages in order to get its finances in order.

Because the government did not hedge against currency swings and failed to include a turnpike in its original plans, the cost of the project continued to soar, pointing to a looming debt problem. The highway itself proved to be extremely expensive, with an average estimated cost of $23.8 million per kilometer.

In 2018, the Center for Global Development, a Washington-based think tank, listed Montenegro as one of eight countries at risk of a debt crisis after receiving a Chinese loan.

""The risks around this highway were clear at the beginning,"" Hillman said. ""This shows what can happen when there isn't proper accountability and effective oversight for these big infrastructure projects.""

China In The Balkans

In addition to the economic problems it poses to Montenegro, the current saga also puts the EU in a difficult position in regard to China in the region.

China continues to loom large in the Balkans, deepening its footprint through infrastructure and energy projects. Beijing has also begun to build up stronger political ties in the region, forging a comprehensive partnership with Serbia that has allowed it to expand out to neighboring countries.

Montenegro is potentially attractive to China for a number of reasons. It gives Beijing a European presence on the Adriatic coast and closer political ties and heightened influence within the country could prove useful if Podgorica joins the EU.

For Brussels, how it decides to navigate this situation will impact its credibility in the Balkans, which has been negatively affected during the pandemic over problematic episodes involving the supply of medical equipment and vaccines.

Still, the EU is the region's top investor and main market and is exploring other avenues to assist Podgorica.

On April 12, French European Affairs Minister Clement Beaune tweeted that Paris was working with the European Commission to find a solution to Montenegro's debt problem and ""reduce the dependence on China in the Balkans.""

""This is a rare opportunity for the EU to step up in its backyard and push back against China,"" Vuksanovic said.

""But it also wouldn't be the first strategic opportunity that the bloc has squandered in the Balkans,"" he added. ""Doing so would be a bad signal to the region and a green light to Beijing.""

Jason Walls is a political reporter for the New Zealand Herald

New Zealand will donate more than 1.6 million Covid-19 doses through an international vaccine sharing programme, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has revealed.

This is enough to vaccinate 800,000 people – many of whom will be health workers and vulnerable people in the Pacific.

She made the announcement at the Gavi Covax event this morning (NZ time), where she was the first world leader to make a pledge.

""In New Zealand, we have been tackling Covid-19 collectively, as the team of 5 million,"" she said in a pre-prepared video.

""Now we need to act globally as the team of 7.8 billion.""

There are few other details at this stage – media were given a link to her video and a number of key points just before 5pm today.

But in early March, Ardern and Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said any surplus vaccines New Zealand had would be donated ""across our wider portfolio to the Pacific and developing countries worldwide"".

""We are committed to ensuring that any doses not needed here are put to good use elsewhere,"" Hipkins said at the time.

In her video, Ardern said: ""We welcome efforts to provide more doses of the vaccine to developing countries.""

She said as an international community, ""we need to do all we can to increase the supply of vaccines"".

She said sharing doses was one way this could help.

New Zealand had already donated $17 million to Covax and the 1.6 million doses were fully funded, she confirmed.

A number of other world leaders also made vaccines pledges at the event.

The Netherlands' Minister for Foreign Trade Sigrid Kaag said vaccines were an essential investment to overcome the pandemic.

""We must upscale the availability of vaccines worldwide, ensure that they reach the most vulnerable and that health systems are strong enough.

0,Peru establishes 2.7 million acre rainforest reserve for isolated Indigenous peoples,https://news.mongabay.com/2021/04/peru-to-establish-rainforest-reserve-for-isolated-indigenous-peoples/,"After nearly twenty years of discussion, the Peruvian government has moved to establish a new Indigenous reserve for “uncontacted peoples” deep in the Amazon rainforest.

Yavarí Tapiche Indigenous Reserve, which covers 1.1 million hectares (2.7 million acres) in the department of Loreto on the Peru-Brazil border, is home to Matsés, Remo, and Marubo peoples, as well as other groups that have yet to be identified.

Yavarí Tapiche will be established under Peru’s law governing territories for peoples in isolation and initial contact (PIACI).

Yavarí Tapiche has been officially categorized as the first PIACI reserve in Loreto, but its protection plan still must be approved by the Ministry of Culture within 60 days.

After nearly twenty years of discussion, the Peruvian government has moved to establish a new Indigenous reserve for “uncontacted peoples” deep in the Amazon rainforest. Yavarí Tapiche Indigenous Reserve, which covers 1.1 million hectares (2.7 million acres) in the department of Loreto on the Peru-Brazil border, is home to Matsés, Remo, and Marubo peoples, as well as other groups that have yet to be identified.

Yavarí Tapiche will be established under Peru’s law governing territories for peoples in isolation and initial contact (PIACI). These peoples, sometimes popularly known as “uncontacted tribes”, have little or no contact with the outside world and live in some of the world’s most biologically diverse landscapes, including remote parts of the Amazon Basin.

Under its PIACI law, Peru has defined ten territories for isolated peoples, of which four — including Yavarí Tapiche — have been categorized as an Indigenous reserve by the state. Two others were categorized as territorial reserves before the Piaci Law was approved and must be adapted, while four others are still waiting for the formal creation process to advance.

Yavarí Tapiche has been officially categorized as the first PIACI reserve in Loreto, but its protection plan still must be approved by the Ministry of Culture within 60 days. This process involves resolving overlapping extractive concessions within the reserve, which means deadlines could slip according to Angela Arriola, a specialist in policies for Indigenous peoples and Piaci and external advisor to the Inter-ethnic Association for the Development of the Peruvian Jungle (Aidesep)

“The creation of Yavarí Tapiche is a great advance. However, the rest of the tools must be implemented as soon as possible to ensure their protection,” said Arriola. “It is a great step, a great advance, but management measures need to be implemented, only categorization is not a guarantee of protection.”

One challenge is protecting Indigenous peoples in Yavarí Tapiche from an array of threats, including drug traffickers, and illegal loggers who operate in the area. For that reason, the Ministry of Culture says it will implement early warning mechanisms and checkpoints.

Additional complication is the reserve overlaps with Sierra del Divisor National Park and the Matsés National Reserve, but Arriola says that shouldn’t be a significant obstacle since the proposed protection strategy for Yavarí Tapiche is consistent.

The history of the Indigenous reserves

The history of the creation of Yavarí Tapiche sheds light on the drawn-out nature of establishing Indigenous reserves in Peru.

Since the application for Yavarí Tapiche was submitted in 2004, there have been many delays and postponements, said Beatriz Huertas, an anthropologist at Aidesep. The first was the enactment of the PIACI law in 2006, which established new processes and conditions to set up reserves for isolated peoples. That law however wasn’t enacted until 2011 and the commission established to evaluate the applications didn’t start until a year later. Then there were objections from companies operating in the area.

“In 2013, Yavarí Tapiche obtained a favorable rating from the state, but received opposition from oil companies operating in that territory and there was a setback. They had to press hard for the Ministry of Culture to move forward,” said Huertas, adding that it was only in 2015 that the necessary studies were carried out to establish the reserve. “Orpio [Regional Organization of Indigenous Peoples of the East] presented solid evidence of the presence of Indigenous peoples in isolation.”

In March 2018, the supreme decree that recognized PIACI’s presence in this territory was issued. And three years later the categorization process was finished. The process took 17 years.

The Ministry of Culture says Yavarí Tapiche is the first to be established after the approval of the PIACI Law.

“It constitutes a historic milestone in the protection of the rights of Indigenous peoples in a situation of isolation and initial contact,” the ministry said in a statement sent to Mongabay Latam.

The ministry said the establishment process is continuing for other proposed and pending reserves for isolated peoples. But for efforts to secure the territory of Indigenous peoples in isolation in Yavarí Tapiche, the two decade wait is almost over.",794,5101,11,84

The move comes amid heightened tensions between the two foes amid a Russian troop build-up close to the Ukrainian border.

The Federal Security Service, or FSB, said in a statement Saturday that Alexander Sosonyuk, Ukraine's consul in St. Petersburg, was taken into custody a day earlier.

The intelligence agency added that Sosonyuk was caught ""red-handed"" during a meeting with a Russian in which he received ""information of a classified nature contained in the databases of law enforcement agencies and the FSB.""

""Such activity is not compatible with his diplomatic status and is of clearly hostile nature towards the Russian Federation.""

The statement, reported by Russian news agencies, didn't give further details.

Ukraine's foreign ministry said Sosonyuk was held for several hours, but was now back at the country's consulate in St. Petersburg.

Russia has detained a number of Ukrainian nationals on suspicion of spying in recent years but the detention of a diplomat is rare.

Neighbors move closer to the edge

The detention comes amid escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine amid a Russian military buildup along the border with the eastern Ukraine region, which is under the control of Russia-backed

rebels.

Kiev has been battling the separatists since 2014, and clashes have intensified since the start of the year, shredding a ceasefire that was agreed last July.

Concern has been mounting that the long-simmering conflict could spiral back into wider fighting, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has asked the West for help.

0,"China, Russia using their COVID-19 vaccines to gain political influence, experts say",https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/china-russia-using-their-covid-19-vaccines-to-gain-political-influence-experts-say-1.5391422,"OTTAWA -- China and Russia have been using their locally produced COVID-19 vaccines to grow their international soft power by giving doses to desperate countries in order to have more political influence over them, experts say.

Benjamin Gedan, deputy director of the Latin America program at the Wilson Center in Washington, called the practice ""vaccine diplomacy,"" noting that it happens when countries seek to grow their international prestige by distributing vaccines to nations that need them.

He said authoritarian governments, including those in China and Russia, have taken the lead in vaccine diplomacy in the last months.

""It's never encouraging to see the world's largest dictatorships taking most advantage of this diplomatic opportunity,"" Gedan said.

The China National Pharmaceutical Group Corp., Sinopharm, is producing two COVID-19 vaccines while Sinovac, a Beijing-based biopharmaceutical company, is making a third one.

Gedan said while China had offered bilateral loans of US$1 billion in Latin America, it refused to give COVID-19 vaccines to Paraguay, which recognizes Taiwan diplomatically.

""There have been reports from the foreign minister of Paraguay that intermediaries of the Chinese government explicitly said that Paraguay will not access the Chinese vaccine unless it changes its position on Taiwan,"" he said.

He added there have been reports that Brazil, which is suffering one of the world's worst COVID-19 outbreaks, could not access Chinese vaccines without committing to allow Chinese telecommunications company Huawei from accessing its 5G wireless network auction.

Lynette Ong, an associate political science professor at the University Of Toronto, said China has donated or sold its COVID-19 vaccine to almost all southeast Asian countries.

""It usually comes with some sort of strings attached,"" she said.

""There's definitely vaccine diplomacy going on quite aggressively by China.""

China's vaccine diplomacy is not as effective as its personal-protective equipment diplomacy was last year, Ong said.

She said China was the only major producer of personal protective equipment last year while it's competing now with many other countries that are producing different types of COVID-19 vaccines.

""China was not the first (country) to have the vaccine produced and manufactured,"" she said.

Ong said China has invested a lot in boosting its soft power in developing countries from Latin America, Africa and southeast Asia, but it has also received a lot of pushback.

""There is so much pushback against Huawei just because it is a Chinese brand, right, not because people have found evidence that we can squarely put Huawei in the category of espionage,"" she said.

Aurel Braun, a Russian foreign policy professor at the University of Toronto, said Russia has been pushing particular political agendas and integrating vaccine diplomacy as a much more significant element of its foreign policy than China.

""China is much wealthier, has a far larger economy than Russia. It is able to provide all kinds of other economic benefits. Providing the vaccine is one of many options that they have,"" he said.

""(For Russia,) The Sputnik V (vaccine) is a much more important tool, and they have been especially focusing in certain parts of Europe or where leaders have been more sympathetic to Mr. Putin's policy ... like Viktor Orban in Hungary or in Slovakia.""

Jillian Kohler, a pharmacy and public health professor at the University of Toronto, said China and Russia saw an opportunity in the lack of COVID-19 vaccine supply, and they are taking advantage of that to further their political goals.

""If ... Russia or China aren't actually asking for something explicitly, there's an implicit bargain happening here,"" she said.

""Countries are turning to Russia and China because they're desperate, so when you do that, I mean, you're in a position of weakness, and when you're in a position of weakness that might mean at some point that you're going to have to compensate for that.""

Gedan, the Washington-based Wilson Center expert, said the United States may soon share its supply of COVID-19 vaccines globally, which would limit China and Russia's ability to influence other countries using their supplies.

""I think we're rapidly approaching the moment where the United States will be able to play a major role in the global vaccination campaign,"" he said.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently named Gayle Smith, who headed the US Agency for International Development under former president Barack Obama, to a new position as the U.S. coordinator for global COVID-19 response to support a worldwide effort to inoculate against the novel coronavirus.

Gedan said the United States has made some efforts to be helpful by committing US$4 billion to COVAX, a World Health Organization program, and by sending Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine shipments to Mexico and Canada.

But these efforts are going to be more significant soon when the U.S begins exporting more of its Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, he said.

He said the United States is planning to do most of its vaccine distributions through COVAX, which means they will get distributed to both friendly governments and adversarial countries.

""(The U.S. approach is) to distribute vaccines in a way that reflects, you know, public health needs and not foreign policy goals,"" he said.

Most countries are not only struggling with a lack of capacity to produce vaccines locally but also with a lack of resources to procure vaccines from the companies that are making them, he said.

He said the lack of a local capacity to produce vaccines has slowed Canada's vaccination campaign, but Canada has been able to purchase an extraordinary number of doses.

""Eventually, Canada will likely be exporting some of these vaccines that it has purchased that are above and beyond its local need.""

0,Swipes at China as Biden and Japanese PM seek united front in Asia Pacific | US news,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/17/swipes-at-china-as-joe-biden-and-japanese-pm-seek-united-front-in-asia-pacific,"Joe Biden has sought to present a united front with Japan’s prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, to counter an increasingly assertive China as the US president held his first face-to-face White House summit since taking office.

Biden hosted Suga for talks on Friday that offered the Democratic president a chance to work further on his pledge to revitalise US alliances that frayed under his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump.

China topped the agenda, underscoring Japan’s central role in Washington’s efforts to face down Beijing. The two leaders addressed an array of geopolitical issues, including Taiwan, with Suga saying they reaffirmed “the importance of peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait”, a slap at Beijing’s increased military pressure on the Chinese-claimed, self-ruled island.

“Today prime minister Suga and I affirmed our ironclad support for the US-Japanese alliance and for our shared security,” Biden told a joint news conference in the White House Rose Garden, calling the discussions “productive”.

“We committed to working together to take on the challenges from China and on issues like the East China Sea, the South China Sea, as well as North Korea, to ensure a future of a free and open Indo-Pacific.”

Other pressing concerns at the talks included China’s increased military movements near Taiwan, its tightening grip on Hong Kong and its crackdown on Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang.

In another swipe at China, Biden said the US and Japan would invest together in areas such as 5G, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, genomics and semiconductor supply chains.

Suga said he and Biden agreed on the necessity of frank discussions with China in the context of Beijing’s activities in the Indo-Pacific region.

China said on Saturday that Taiwan, Hong Kong and Xinjiang were China’s internal affairs and should not be interfered with.

The summit - Biden’s first in-person meeting with a foreign leader as president - came just days after China sent 25 aircraft, including fighters and nuclear-capable bombers, near Taiwan, which Beijing considers a wayward province.

Suga said the talks acknowledged the “importance of peace and stability” in the Taiwan Strait as he continued Japan’s recent policy of trying to balance security concerns about China with economic ties.

A senior US official said earlier that the summit had been expected to produce a formal statement on Taiwan. After the talks, it was unclear whether this would happen. Any such joint statement would be the first on Taiwan – China’s most sensitive territorial issue – by US and Japanese leaders since 1969.

China’s foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, said China has expressed solemn concern about “collusion” between Japan and the US, and the countries should take China’s concerns seriously.

Speaking later to a Washington think tank, Suga said Japan would say what is needed to be said to China and speak up on human rights, but also stressed the need to establish a stable, constructive relationship with Beijing.

At the White House news conference, Suga said he told Biden that he was committed to moving forward with the summer Olympic Games in Japan and that Biden offered his support. Japan is grappling with rising coronavirus infections with fewer than 100 days until the planned start.

“I told the president about my determination to realise the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic games this summer as a symbol of global unity,” Suga said.

As they sat down for talks, Biden, Suga and their two delegations all wore masks, in keeping with protocols to protect against the spread of Covid-19.

Biden appeared determined to get off on the right foot with Suga after four years in which Trump sometimes chastised allies in Asia and elsewhere over what he saw as insufficient defence spending or funding for US troop presence and questioned the value of bedrock military alliances.

With the Suga meeting and another planned summit with South Korea in May, Biden hopes to energize joint efforts with Australia, India and Japan in a grouping known as the Quad, as well as with South Korea, to counter China and longtime US foe North Korea.",670,4152,17,84

""I have to be very clear in this: the Brazilian authorities' negligence is costing lives.""

—Dr. Christos Christou, MSF

""After accounting for over a quarter of global Covid-19 deaths last week, Brazil does not have an effective plan in place to deal with the pandemic,"" the international medical charity, known by its French acronym, MSF, charged in a blog post.

""The pandemic in the country has become politicized, and the government has not adopted science-based measures to try to bring it under control,"" the group said, referring to the administration of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro—who has dismissed Covid-19 as a ""little flu"" while refusing to follow or promote mask-wearing, quarantines, and social distancing despite having contracted the virus last year. Bolsonaro has also encouraged large gatherings and disparaged vaccines.

""The lack of political will to adequately respond to the pandemic is killing Brazilians in their thousands,"" said MSF. ""Last week, Brazilians accounted for 11% of the world's Covid-19 infections and 26.2% global Covid-19 deaths. On 8 April, 4,249 deaths from Covid-19 were recorded in a single 24-hour period, alongside 86,652 new Covid-19 infections.""

According to Johns Hopkins University's global coronavirus tracker, nearly 362,000 people have died of Covid-19 in Brazil, trailing only the United States and its more than 565,000 deaths.

""Last week, intensive care units were full in 21 out of 27 of Brazil's capitals,"" said MSF. ""In hospitals across the country there are ongoing shortages of both oxygen, needed to treat patients who are severely and critically ill, as well as sedatives, needed to intubate critically ill patients. As a result, our teams have seen patients, who may have otherwise had a chance at survival, being left without appropriate medical care.""

""Public health measures have become a political battlefield in Brazil. As a result, science-based policies are associated with political opinions, rather than the need to protect individuals and their communities from Covid-19.""

—Christou

Pierre Van Heddegem, emergency coordinator for MSF's Covid-19 response in Brazil, said that ""not only are patients dying without access to healthcare, but medical staff are exhausted and suffering from severe psychological and emotional trauma due to their working conditions.""

MSF international president Dr. Christos Christou said that ""public health measures have become a political battlefield in Brazil. As a result, science-based policies are associated with political opinions, rather than the need to protect individuals and their communities from Covid-19.""

""The Brazilian authorities have overseen the unmitigated spread of Covid-19,"" Christou continued. ""Their refusal to adapt evidence-based public health measures has sent too many to an early grave. The response in Brazil needs an urgent, science-based reset.""

Driving home his point once again during a Thursday press conference, Christou added: ""I have to be very clear in this: the Brazilian authorities' negligence is costing lives.""",557,3714,9,84

Britain stands in ""full support"" of the Czech Republic which foreign minister Dominic Raab said on Sunday had exposed the lengths Russian intelligence services will go to after Prague accused Moscow of involvement in an ammunition depot explosion.

Czech police said on Saturday they were searching for two men in connection with serious criminal activity carrying Russian passports in the names of Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, and that the men were in the country in days leading up to the blast at the Czech depot in 2014.

Those were the aliases used by two Russian military intelligence (GRU) officers who British prosecutors charged with the attempted poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia with the nerve agent Novichok in 2018. Moscow denied involvement in that incident.

""The UK stands in full support of our Czech allies, who have exposed the lengths that the GRU will go to in their attempts to conduct dangerous and malign operations – and highlights a disturbing pattern of behaviour following the attack in Salisbury,"" Raab said on Twitter.

Ties between Britain and Russia have plunged to post-Cold War lows, with London calling the country ""the most acute threat to our security"" in the Euro-Atlantic region in its foreign and defence policy statement last month.

In an interview conducted for the Andrew Marr Show on Friday, Russian Ambassador Andrei Kelin said he had not seen Raab for more than a year.

""In the recent year our relations have become worse..., even worse,"" Kelin said in the interview, which aired on Sunday.

The proposed Colombo Port City Economic Commission Bill will turn the Colombo Port City--a dream project of Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa--into a Chinese colony, an opposition party in Sri Lanka alleged.

Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the leader of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) party, said on Monday that the bill would allow the city to function beyond the existing laws of the country.

He further added that the proposed bill which was included in the Order Paper of Parliament would empower the president to appoint a Colombo Port City Economic Commission which includes five or seven members named by him.

Under the bill, the commission would be empowered with special financial power and judicial immunity, he claimed.

Local businesses, he said, would not be allowed to establish laws in the post-city areas. Another controversial clause is the payment of salary to the staff working in the port city zone. The rules will empower the commission to pay salaries to employees even in foreign currencies.

There was a threat of the Port City becoming a separate territory with independent powers devoid of common laws of the country, he said. He stressed the need to defeat it being enacted in Parliament.

The leader claimed he would challenge the bill legally in court.",214,1319,13,85
0,China Backs Away as Philippines and U.S. Send Impressive Fleet to West Philippine Sea,https://www.esquiremag.ph/politics/news/china-backs-down-a00293-20210416-lfrm,"In a surprising move, the Philippines sent its strongest response yet against China’s expansion into the West Philippine Sea. Not since 2012 has the Philippines moved its naval forces to the West Philippine Sea to challenge China’s militarization of the area. The move is a highly coordinated response with the United States.

In March, the Philippines reported the presence of 220 Chinese vessels at Julian Felipe Reef. That number has been reduced to fewer than 10 as of April 13.

“The Chinese have blinked,” retired U.S. Navy officer Jerry Hendrix told Forbes.

Below are photos taken by the Philippine Coast Guard on April 13 and 14 showing Philippine and Chinese vessels at Julian Felipe Reef.

The Philippines sent four of its most advanced warships to the West Philippine Sea to challenge China’s increasing activities at Julian Felipe Reef. Among the units it deployed are its two brand-new missile-guided frigates, the BRP Jose Rizal and the BRP Antonio Luna. It also deployed warplanes to monitor the area.

Meanwhile, the U.S. also sent its aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt to the area. But an American aircraft carrier never travels alone. With every sighting of a U.S. carrier, you can expect it brings along a large escort of submarines, destroyers, and cruisers protecting it from other vessels. This is on top of the dozens of aircraft it carries (it can carry up to 90 aircraft and can accommodate 4,500 personnel).

The U.S. also deployed the USS Makin Island, a formidable assault ship that can carry up to 20 attack aircraft or stealth strike-fighters. It also has its own escorts of submarines, destroyers, and cruisers.

In March 2021, the Philippine Coast Guard raised the alarm over the presence of 220 Chinese ships forming a phalanx at Julian Felipe Reef, which is within the country’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ). It was what prompted the coordinated military response from the Philippines and the United States.

ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW

By April, the Chinese vessels have dissipated to a couple of dozen, a clear sign of China backing down in response to the forceful reaction from the Philippines and the U.S.

China used the same strategy in the past whenever it wanted to militarize a Philippine reef: It would send a large flotilla of paramilitary “fishing boats” to the area to scare away other vessels, then its dredgers would follow, destroying precious corals to create artificial islands over the reef. Julian Felipe Reef would have ended up with the same fate.

An Unexpected Philippine Response

Ever since the 2012 standoff at Scarborough Shoal between China and the Philippines, the latter has opted not to send warships from the navy but relied on vessels from the Philippine Coast Guard instead to assert its presence in the West Philippine Sea. It was because of the ongoing international arbitration with China that the Philippines eventually won in 2016—the Philippines did not want to jeopardize its case and be construed as an aggressor.

But ever since then, the country had downplayed Chinese incursions into the West Philippine Sea.

The latest development proves significant, not only because the Philippines actually challenged China, but also because it is the first time it has sent a weapon of war to assert itself. To the Chinese generals, that is something to be very serious about. Historically, China respects force, no matter how seemingly small it is.

China Respects Force

According to professor and geopolitical analyst Richard Heydarian, China respects power.

“Chinese statecraft has contempt for the weak and the naive,” Heydarian told Esquire Philippines in 2020. “But China grudgingly respects those with strategic dignity and courage.”

For example, Indonesia, which has taken a very strong stance against China on its sea disputes and even sunk a number of confiscated Chinese vessels, has already received 1.2 million initial doses of the vaccine delivered from China in November. Another 1.8 million doses were delivered in January, and more are expected to come.

It also helps that the U.S. has specifically stated any attack on Philippine vessels would trigger its Mutual Defense Treaty obligations.

“An armed attack against the Philippines armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft in the Pacific, including in the South China Sea, will trigger our obligations under the Mutual Defense Treaty,"" the U.S. State Department warned.

In the past, the U.S. had been vague about the Mutual Defense Treaty and its scope, saying obligations would only be triggered if they happen within the Philippines’ territorial waters, not its EEZ. It looks like they are changing that position now.

In any case, it looks like China will not be militarizing Julian Felipe Reef anytime soon.

0,Brazilian health workers forced to intubate Covid patients without sedatives: Reports,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazilian-health-workers-forced-to-intubate-covid-patients-without-sedatives-reports-101618559004617.html,"Reports are emerging of Brazilian health workers forced to intubate patients without the aid of sedatives, after weeks of warnings that hospitals and state governments risked running out of critical medicines.

One doctor at the Albert Schweitzer municipal hospital in Rio de Janeiro told the Associated Press that for days health workers diluted sedatives to make their stock last longer. Once it ran out, nurses and doctors had to begin using neuromuscular blockers and tying patients to their beds, the doctor said.

“You relax the muscles and do the procedure easily, but we don’t have sedation,” said the doctor, who agreed to discuss the sensitive situation only if not quoted by name. “Some try to talk, resist. They’re conscious.”

Lack of required medicines is the latest pandemic problem to befall Brazil, which is experiencing a brutal COVID-19 outbreak that has flooded the nation’s intensive care units. The daily death count is averaging about 3,000, accounting for a quarter of deaths globally and making Brazil the epicenter of the pandemic.

“Intubation kits” include anesthetics, sedatives and other medications used to put severely ill patients on ventilators. The press office of Rio city's health secretariat said in an email that occasional shortages at the Albert Schweitzer facility are due to difficulties obtaining supplies on the global market and that “substitutions are made so that there is no damage to the assistance provided.” It didn't comment on the need to tie patients to beds.

The newspaper O Globo on Thursday reported similar ordeals in several other hospitals in the Rio metropolitan region, with people desperately calling other facilities seeking sedatives for their loved ones.

It’s unclear whether the problem seen in Rio remains an isolated case, but others are sounding the alarm about impending shortages.

Sao Paulo state's health secretary, Jean Carlo Gorinchteyn, said at a news conference Wednesday that the situation was dire in the hospitals of Brazil's most-populous state. On Thursday, more than 640 hospitals were on the verge of collapse, with shortages possible within days, officials said.

“We need the federal government's support,” Gorinchteyn said. “This is not a necessity for Sao Paulo; it is a necessity for the whole country.”

His state's health officials sent nine requests for intubation medication to the Health Ministry over the past 40 days, according to a statement Wednesday. Its last delivery was enough to cover just 6% of monthly needs in the state’s public health network, officials told AP.

Federal Health Minister Marcelo Queiroga, who took over the post last month, said Wednesday that a shipment of sedatives was expected to arrive in Brazil “in the next ten days.” It is the result of a contract signed with the Pan American Health Organization.

He said two separate efforts to acquire medications on the international market are underway “to end this day-to-day struggle.”

For many weeks, the ministry has also been facing logistical constraints on getting oxygen delivered to hospitals across the country. Queiroga said it remains ""a daily concern.″

A more contagious coronavirus variant, known as P.1, has been spreading across Brazil this year. It may also be more aggressive than the original strain, and health workers have reported patients requiring far more oxygen than last year.

The private sector has stepped up to help address some of the supply shortfall. A group of seven large companies donated 3.4 million doses of intubation drugs — enough for the management of 500 beds for six weeks — to the Health Ministry.

A first batch of 2.3 million was scheduled to arrive from China late Thursday at Sao Paulo's international airport and would be distributed to states with critical shortages, the ministry said in an emailed response to AP questions about supply bottlenecks.

Last month, the Health Ministry requisitioned intubation medications from laboratories, reportedly as a means to distribute to the neediest hospitals. That has caused others facilities’ stocks to dwindle, said Edson Rogatti, director of an association of more than 2,000 hospitals nationwide.

“If we run out, the health sector will be in chaos,” Rogatti said on Globo News TV.

Shortages aren’t limited to the public sector. Brazil’s private hospital association published a survey Thursday in which nine of 71 institutions reported having supplies for five days or less. About half said they had enough for a week.

Private facilities are looking to import medications from India, but still need regulatory approval, the association told AP.

The city of Itaiopolis in southern Santa Catarina state this week reported shortages of both sedatives and oxygen. Neighboring Rio Grande do Sul state also reported supplies running out.

“The situation is desperate,” Rio Grande do Sul’s health secretary, Arita Bergmann, said in a statement Thursday. “We urgently need the Health Ministry to replenish hospitals’ stocks, or else intubated patients can wake up without medication, and that would be terrible.”",802,5085,11,85

Thomas Peter | Reuters

BEIJING — China reported first-quarter gross domestic product a touch below expectations as industrial production disappointed but retail sales beat. GDP soared 18.3% in the first three months of the year from a year ago, China's National Bureau of Statistics said Friday. That's slightly below expectations of a 19% increase, according to analysts polled by Reuters. The surge in growth comes off a contraction in the first quarter of last year, when the economy shrank by 6.8% during the height of the domestic outbreak of Covid-19. China was the first country to deal with the disease, and the economy returned to growth by the second quarter of last year. GDP expanded 10.3% in the first quarter when compared with the same period in 2019, the statistics bureau said.

China also said retail sales rose 34.2% in March, topping expectations of 28% growth. Industrial production rose 14.1% in March, missing Reuters' prediction of 17.2% growth. The slower growth in industrial production came despite more workers staying put during the Spring Festival and not traveling home for what can be a month-long holiday. The statistics bureau cautioned in an English-language statement that the spread of Covid-19 globally and the ""international landscape is complicated with high uncertainties and instabilities."" ""The foundation for domestic recovery is yet to be consolidated and long-standing structural problems remain prominent with new situations and issues arising from development,"" the bureau said. The urban surveyed unemployment rate ticked lower in March to 5.3%, but that of China's youngest workers aged 16 to 24 remained a high 13.6%, the data showed. ""Young people's employment problem still needs a period of time to be absorbed,"" said Liu Aihua, spokesperson of the National Bureau of Statistics, according to a CNBC translation of her Mandarin-language remarks. ""The total pressure in this aspect does exist."" She added that other surveys have found a shortage in general workers and high-skilled talent. Liu said the bureau recently found in a survey of more than 90,000 industrial businesses that a historically high ratio of 44% said hiring was their biggest problem.

0,Israeli spies impersonated journalists to gather info from Emirati dissidents: Report,https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2021/04/17/649661/Israel-spies-Bluehawk-UAE-,"A private Israeli spy company has reportedly impersonated journalists in order to elicit information from opponents of the leadership of Ras Al Khaimah, one of the seven emirates of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

The Daily Beast reported last week that individuals pretending to be a Fox News researcher and a reporter for Italy’s La Stampa newspaper approached two men, who have fallen afoul of the Ras Al Khaimah regime, in early 2020.

The journalist impersonators, it added, tried to trick the two men into divulging information about their legal disputes with the Emirati authorities.

Facebook revealed that the accounts used by the two supposed journalists were associated with the private Israeli intelligence firm Bluehawk CI.

In one of the cases, a woman claiming to be named “Samantha,” a FOX News journalist, contacted Oussama el-Omari by email, trying to obtain information about his legal rifts with the Ras Al Khaimah regime.

Omari, former chief executive and director general of the Ras Al Khaimah Free Trade Zone Authority, was convicted in absentia in the UAE for “embezzlement and abuse of position” following a succession battle in the emirate.

Similarly, another Facebook user pretending to be a La Stampa reporter contacted Khater Massaad, another foe of the current Ras Al Khaimah leadership.

Massaad was convicted by an Emirati court in 2015 of embezzlement from Ras Al Khaimah’s sovereign wealth fund, RAKIA.

Both Omari and Massaad say the charges against them are politically motivated.

Meanwhile, a Times of Israel investigation found that Guy Klisman, a former major in the Israel Army who owns Bluehawk CI, has a history of prior fraud prosecutions in the occupied territories.

Established in June 2018, the company claims on its website that it offers cyber technologies and intelligence solutions, including “social engineering & PR campaign management” and “complex intelligence investigations.”

Last year’s normalization of ties between Israel and the UAE paved the way for lucrative deals by Israeli intelligence and cybersecurity firms in the Persian Gulf country.

Commenting on the Daily Beast report, Radha Stirling, CEO of Detained in Dubai, a company that represents clients in legal disputes with the UAE governments, said she believes the government of Ras Al Khaimah is responsible.

“This is monstrous,” Stirling emphasized in a press release. “By contracting the espionage out to a private firm, the government of Ras Al Khaimah is trying to avoid accountability for spying on foreign nationals outside their jurisdiction; but this is a major breach and the UAE and Israel must be called to account.”",418,2655,11,85
0,Over 70 airstrikes hit ISIS caves and bunkers in 24 hours carried out by Russian jets,https://www.syriahr.com/en/214107/,"SOHR sources have reported that Russian jets have executed new airstrikes on ISIS positions in the Syrian desert, as they carried out over 70 airstrikes in the past 24 hours, targeting positions in Itheriya and its surrounding areas in the eastern countryside of Hama, Al-Rasafah desert in Al-Raqqah countryside, positions in Hama-Aleppo-Al-Raqqah triangle and positions on the administrative border between Al-Raqqah and Deir Ezzor. The airstrikes hit caves and bunkers, which is very likely that ISIS members are holed up in, as well as the back lines in an attempt to put an end to ISIS activity in the region, amid reports of casualties.

Yesterday, SOHR sources have reported that Russian fighter jets executed intensive airstrikes since the early hours of Saturday morning, targeting ISIS caves and bunkers in Aleppo-Hama-Raqqa triangle, amid reports of casualties among ISIS members.

On Friday, SOHR activists documented over 35 Russian airstrikes since morning, which targeted ISIS positions in the Syrian desert, as the airstrikes were concentrated on Jabal Al-Bishri in southern Al-Raqqah and Hama desert.

Meanwhile, combing operations by regime forces and Russian-backed militias continued in several sectors of the Syrian desert.

On April 12, SOHR sources reported that regime forces and Russian-backed militias were deployed in areas of the Syrian desert and Aleppo-Hama-Al-Raqqah triangle, along with preparations for launching a combing operations in several areas of Al-Raqqah desert.

While on April 12, reliable sources informed the Syrian Observatory that a military delegation comprising officers of the Russian military police and others from the pro-Russian “Fifth Corps” visited the military airport of Al-Tabqa on Monday, where the delegation conducted an inspection tour in the posts of National Defense Forces and the Fifth Corps in al-Raqqa countryside.

This development coincides with new reinforcement brought in by regime forces and the Fifth Corps in order to launch a new military campaign in the Syrian desert, specifically in the deserts of Safian and Al-Rusafa in al-Raqqa countryside, against ISIS members and cells prevalent in the region, along with a similar campaign by the same forces, backed by Russian air support, in al-Mayadeen desert since the beginning of this month.",352,2318,16,85
0,Elon Musk’s SpaceX wins contract to develop spacecraft to land astronauts on the moon,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/16/nasa-lunar-lander-contract-spacex/,"In winning the $2.9 billion contract, SpaceX beat out Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin, which had formed what it called a “national team” by partnering with aerospace giants Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper. SpaceX also won over Dynetics, a defense contractor based in Huntsville, Ala. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

Story continues below advertisement

NASA had originally chosen all three companies for the initial phase of the contract, and was expected to choose two of them to build the lunar lander. In other major programs, NASA has chosen multiple providers to foster competition and to ensure it has redundancy in case one can’t deliver.

In a document explaining NASA’s rationale for picking SpaceX obtained by The Washington Post, NASA said it wanted “to preserve a competitive environment at this stage of the HLS Program.” But it added that “NASA’s current fiscal year budget did not support even a single [contract] award.” As a result, SpaceX updated its payment schedule so that it now fits “within NASA’s current budget.”

But in moving ahead with SpaceX alone, it sent a message that it fully trusts the growing company to fly its astronauts for its signature human exploration program — Artemis, a campaign to return astronauts to the moon for the first time since 1972.

“As the first human lunar lander in 50 years, this innovative human landing system will be a hallmark in space exploration history,” Lisa Watson-Morgan, NASA’s lunar lander program manager, said during a news briefing announcing the award. “NASA’s Apollo program captured the world’s attention, demonstrated the power of America’s vision and technology, and can-do spirit. And we expect Artemis will similarly inspire great achievements, innovation and scientific discoveries. We’re confident in NASA’s partnership with SpaceX to help us achieve the Artemis mission.”

Over the past several years, SpaceX, founded by Musk in 2002 with the goal of eventually flying humans to Mars, has completely upended the space industry, moving through fast, and at times fiery test campaigns that have unsettled traditional industry officials but also ignited new waves of enthusiasm not seen since the early days of the Space Age.

When Musk first started the company, even he didn’t think it would succeed. In 2008, after three test flights of its Falcon 1 rocket failed to reach orbit, he was nearly out of money. But the next test was successful, and NASA awarded the company a modest contract that kept it afloat.

Story continues below advertisement

In the years since, SpaceX has flown cargo and supplies to the International Space Station, and then, astronauts, overcoming skeptics who said human spaceflight should never be outsourced to the private sector, and certainly not to a company as green — and brash — as SpaceX.

In 2015, one of its Falcon 9 rockets exploded on a mission for NASA flying cargo to the station. Another exploded on the launchpad ahead of an engine test in 2016. And after Musk smoked pot on a podcast broadcast on the Internet, then-NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine ordered a safety review of the entire company.

But despite the setbacks, SpaceX has achieved enormous success — flying astronauts safely and dominating the launch market, while lowering the cost and dramatically increasing the number of flights.

Story continues below advertisement

For the Artemis program, SpaceX bid its reusable Starship spacecraft, which is being designed to fly large numbers of people into deep space and land on celestial bodies as well as back on Earth.

On Twitter, the company said it is “humbled to help @NASAArtemis usher in a new era of human space exploration.” In a statement, Blue Origin said its “National Team doesn’t have very much information yet. We are looking to learn more about the selection.” Dynetics did not respond to requests for comment.

The company has been putting its Starship spacecraft through a fast-paced test campaign at its facility in South Texas, launching prototypes without any people on board several miles up in the air, then flying them back to a landing site.

So far, all the test vehicles have crash-landed in a series of fireballs that triggered investigations overseen by the Federal Aviation Administration. But the company is expected to try again soon with a test vehicle that Musk has said is outfitted with several upgrades. And it hopes to be able to fly the spacecraft to orbit this year.

SpaceX was one of two providers hired by NASA to fly its astronauts to the International Space Station. It flew two missions with astronauts last year and its next mission scheduled to launch on Thursday. Boeing, the other company hired to ferry crews to the station and back, has stumbled badly and has yet to fly a test mission with astronauts.

That experience shows why NASA is best served by having at least two providers on major programs, officials said, and the pressure will be on SpaceX to perform. According to the document explaining the decision, SpaceX’s bid “was the lowest among the offerors by a wide margin.” NASA also liked Starship’s ability to ferry a lot of cargo to and from the surface of the moon as well, which it said “has the potential to greatly improve scientific operations.”

While the contract will cover the first human landing, Watson-Morgan said NASA “will also begin work immediately on a follow-up competition” to “provide regularly recurring services to the lunar surface that will enable these crewed missions on sustainable basis.”

The Artemis program began under the administration of former president Donald Trump but has been embraced by the Biden administration, though the White House is reconsidering the timeline. Trump had ordered that astronauts land on the moon by 2024, a schedule the White House now says is under review as NASA works to develop its rockets and spacecraft. It is also working with Congress to get the funding it needs.

For this fiscal year, Congress appropriated $850 million for the effort — well short of the $3.3 billion NASA said it needed to meet the 2024 timeline.

Earlier this month, the Biden administration proposed a $24.7 billion budget for NASA, a 6.3 percent increase that included an additional $325 million for the Artemis program.

Acting NASA Administrator Steve Jurczyk praised the request and said it “supports the development of capabilities for sustainable, long-duration human exploration beyond Earth, and eventually to Mars.”

Previously NASA vowed that it would land a woman on the moon as part of the first Artemis lunar landing. But in his statement, Jurczyk said the agency would also include the “first person of color” as part of the program.

The White House recently nominated former Florida Sen. Bill Nelson (D) to lead the agency. His confirmation hearing is scheduled for next week, and he is expected to win confirmation easily. During his time in Congress, Nelson was a strong advocate for space exploration, and he flew on the space shuttle in 1986 as a member of the House. If confirmed, he has said he would push to get the funding the Artemis program needs, as the agency reassesses the timeline for returning astronauts to the moon.

Also on Friday, the White House said it would nominate former NASA astronaut Pamela Melroy, a retired Air Force colonel, to be the space agency’s deputy administrator.

The contracts for the lunar landers come a year after NASA awarded three initial contracts to Blue Origin, Dynetics and SpaceX.

In awarding those contracts, NASA said Blue Origin and its team was furthest along and awarded it the largest contract, $579 million. Dynetics, which is partnering with the Sierra Nevada Corp., received $253 million, and SpaceX won $135 million.

The defeat is a huge blow Blue Origin, and to Bezos, who has long been fascinated by the moon and has for years wanted to be part of the effort to return there. He has said that watching Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walk on the moon when he was 5 years old was “a seminal moment” for him.",1375,8449,14,85

Witnesses told Amnesty International that Eritrean troops were passing through the town located in the Tigray region, when they suddenly opened fire at people on the main street close to the bus station.

“Three people lost their lives and at least 19 others are in hospital from yet another unlawful attack by Eritrean troops on civilians in Tigray. Deliberate attacks on civilians are prohibited by international humanitarian law and must stop,” said Sarah Jackson, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes.

“We are calling for an international investigation into this and other incidents and allegations of human rights violations, including war crimes and possible crimes against humanity, committed in the ongoing conflict in Tigray”.

Six witnesses told Amnesty International that the some of the injured were taken to Don Bosco hospital in Adwa town, and 19 of them were rushed to Axum referral hospital for advanced medical care.

Teklu*, who works in the bus station told Amnesty International: “The Eritrean soldiers on the back of one Ural military truck and another heavy truck started shooting. We scattered in different directions. I hid in the drainage. We knew that they are Eritreans soldiers because they were swearing in Tigrinya, the heavy trucks had Eritrean number plates and Eritrean defense force camouflages. They were shooting from the backs of the moving trucks”.

There must be justice and accountability for war crimes and human rights violations in Tigray. This attack and other allegations of violations must be independently and impartially investigated by an international inquiry Sarah Jackson, Amnesty International's Deputy Regional Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes

Sertse*, who was also near the bus station at the time of the incident, told Amnesty International: “I was walking from my shop which is near the PanAfric hotel towards the bus station. The shooting started immediately after the two trucks passed me. There were rickshaws on the road and the soldiers on the first truck were shouting in Tigrinya to the rickshaw drivers to clear off the road. Then the soldiers on the second truck started shooting. There were many people on the street”.

According to a member of the medical staff at Axum University Teaching and Referral Hospital, all of the people that were received at the hospital had either been shot in their chests, stomachs, legs, and hands, and six of them were in critical condition as of 13 April. The staffer said one girl was in shock due to blood loss, and that other patients had suffered broken hands and legs.

Solomon*, another witness, said: “The Eritrean soldiers came on two heavy trucks from the Adi Abun area. I was on the road just outside of my home when the shooting started at around 8 am. It was sudden and I thought there was a gunfight going on in the area. In fact, there was no fighting but just shooting at passersby. One of the deceased was killed just five metres from my home. He died instantly. I saw him”.

“There must be justice and accountability for war crimes and human rights violations in Tigray. This attack and other allegations of violations must be independently and impartially investigated by an international inquiry. Ethiopia and Eritrea must fully cooperate with such investigations and ensure full reparation for victims and their families”, said Sarah Jackson.",592,3623,14,86

Things have not worked out exactly according to Castro's plan.

As Castro announced he was stepping down on Friday, his country is deep in crisis. The tourism-dependent island has been battered by the pandemic; the economy shrunk at least 11% in 2020 according to government estimates. Cubans each day spend hours in long lines to find increasingly scarce food, medicine and other necessities.

While Cuban officials have made an all-out effort to thwart the spread of the coronavirus, cases are at an all-time high on the island. It will likely take many more months to know if Cuba's ambitious, ""Hail Mary"" plan to develop the island's own homegrown vaccines will prove successful.

With then-US President Barack Obama, Castro mended long fraught US-Cuban relations, only to see those ties blown up again under the Trump administration which enacted some of the toughest economic penalties on the island in decades.

But so far, current President Joe Biden has been reluctant to engage with the communist-run island despite the most significant change in leadership in Cuba in decades.

""Regardless of what administration we have, Republican or Democrat, it's a good time to engage,"" said former Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ), a rare member of the GOP to push for improved relations, who met with Raul Castro during frequent trips to Cuba. ""It benefits the Cuban people and puts pressure on the Cuban government that they don't have when we try to isolate them.""

It's difficult to imagine a more precarious time for the last members of the aging generation that transformed Cuba into a socialist state to finally relax their hold on power.

Despite deepening uncertainty, Cubans witnessed an historic changing of the guard at this week's 8th Congress for the Cuban Communist Party, ""the supreme body"" of the only political party permitted on the island.

The congress started Friday, timed to commemorate the 60th anniversary of Cuba's victory over CIA-trained exiles during the Bay of Pigs invasion.

Even if the outgoing head of the party's family continues to wield unquestionable power on the island, once the congress is over, no one with the last name Castro will occupy a senior position of leadership for the first time in over 62 years.

Since the early years of the revolution, Cuba's head of state has always led the party, making it nearly impossible to determine where the government ends and the party begins.

But in 2018, Castro stepped down as president, making way for his handpicked successor, Miguel Diaz-Canel, to take over running the day-to-day management of the government. Castro stayed as head of the party, which oversees long term planning, but said Diaz-Canel would likely assume that position too in 2021

""After that,"" Castro said in 2018, ""If my health permits it, I will be just one more soldier with the people, defending this revolution.""

His departure brings an end to the era of his famous clan occupying the top leadership on the island. None of the children of Castro's older brother, Fidel, who died in 2016, hold government posts.

Raul Castro's son, Alejandro, is a colonel in Cuba's Interior Ministry and his daughter, Mariela, runs a government center promoting LGBTQ rights. A son-in-law, Gen. Luis Alberto Rodríguez López-Callejas, heads a sprawling military company that controls state-owned hotels, marinas and infrastructure projects but he maintains a low public profile.

Cuba is one of the countries that has changed the least since the end of the Cold War, even as government officials acknowledge the island desperately needs to adapt. Finding the path to modernizing Cuba's economy will now fall squarely on the shoulders of Miguel Diaz-Canel, Castro's successor as president who is expected to take over as head of the communist party.

Trained as an electrical engineer, Diaz-Canel ran local governments in two provinces before becoming minister of higher education and then vice president and president.

Diaz-Canel is the first Cuban who was born after the 1959 revolution to become president. Gaining the leadership of the party will further establish the tall, grey-haired technocrat as the political heir to the Castros. But it remains unclear how he differs from his predecessors.

""I believe in continuity,"" Díaz-Canel told reporters in 2018 when asked about his vision for Cuba's future. ""I think there always will be continuity.""

Diaz-Canel has tried to project a more active image to the Cuban public, posting on Twitter regularly. He immediately visited the still-smoldering scene of a passenger plane crash in 2018 in Havana that killed 112 people, and he holds cabinet meetings across the island as Fidel Castro used to.

JUST WATCHED CNN granted rare access to Cuban presidential tour Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN granted rare access to Cuban presidential tour 03:19

The optics may have changed somewhat but Diaz-Canel is a vocal adherent to the ideology that rigid state control of the economy remains the best way forward for Cuba, despite decades of stagnant economic growth. And any public opposition to the party line, he has said, is the work of Cubans who are ""mal nacidos"" or born in the wrong country.

Even with all the official talk of maintaining the course, Cuba is changing. Many in Cuba's nascent private sector complain openly about the slow pace of reforms. Artists fed up with official censorship and activists pushing for legislation protecting animal rights have used increased internet access to organize and publicize small protests that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.

As Cuba's government faces increased challenges and threats, some hardliners may be wary of Raul Castro's exit. But former Senator Jeff Flake told CNN that Castro is likely resist any last-minute appeals to remain.

""He seems a lot more willing to walk into the sunset certainly than his brother did. He would always talk about his grandkids and his family,"" Flake said.

""But really to move on, to enact the reforms that Cuba needs, they will need to move well beyond the Castros.""

Japan's Nissan Motor (7201.T) will furlough around 800 workers at its production plant in Britain, as output slows there because of a semiconductor shortage, the Nikkei newspaper reported.

The people, who represent about a tenth of the workforce at the facility in Sunderland, will be asked to stay away until the chip shortage eases and production can increase, the Nikkei said, without saying where it got the information.

A Nissan spokeswoman was not able to immediately comment.

Carmakers around the world are struggling with a chip shortage caused by strong demand from makers of smartphones and other consumer electronics amid the COVID pandemic. A fire at a Japanese auto chip plant last month has further squeezed supplies.

Nissan plans to slash production at several factories in Japan next month, sources earlier told Reuters. read more

New U.S. sanctions on Russia are ""mostly symbolic"" and will have minimal impact on markets and the macroeconomic outlook, economists have suggested.

President Biden's administration on Thursday announced a raft of new sanctions against Moscow over 2020 election interference, a huge cyberattack on U.S. government and corporate networks, illegal annexation and occupation of Ukraine's Crimea, and human rights abuses.

Sanctions targeted 16 entities and 16 individuals accused of attempting to influence the 2020 U.S. presidential election, along with five individuals and three entities linked to the Crimea annexation, and expelled 10 Russian diplomats from the U.S.

Washington also imposed sanctions on newly-issued Russian sovereign debt, which caused a slight sell-off in the Russian ruble and sovereign bonds on Thursday.

The move prevents U.S. financial institutions from participating in the primary market for ruble and non-ruble denominated debt after June 14.

'Symbolic exercise'

However, economists do not foresee any tangible fallout from the sanctions in their current form.

""The latest round of U.S. sanctions was a mostly symbolic exercise,"" Agathe Demarais, global forecasting director at The Economist Intelligence Unit, told CNBC on Friday.

""Sanctions on Russian individuals and companies are irrelevant, as these people and firms have no ties to the US and probably no intention to ever use the U.S. dollar or to have bank accounts in the U.S.""

Demarais added that the sanctions on sovereign debt are less stringent than the initial market reaction would suggest, since they only target the primary debt market and can therefore ""easily be circumvented via the secondary market.""",323,2106,13,86
0,U.S. Has Only ‘Low To Medium’ Confidence That Russians Put Bounties On American Troops,https://www.tampafp.com/u-s-has-only-low-to-medium-confidence-that-russians-put-bounties-on-american-troops/,"Chuck Ross

The Biden administration has only “low to medium” confidence that Russia put bounties on American troops in Afghanistan, U.S. officials said Thursday.

“The United States intelligence community assesses with low to moderate confidence that Russian intelligence officers sought to encourage Taliban attacks U.S. and coalition personnel in Afghanistan in 2019 and perhaps earlier,” a U.S. official told reporters Thursday.

According to reporters who attended a briefing about the intelligence, officials attach a low confidence level to the allegation because it came from “detainee reporting,” meaning that a captured Taliban fighter likely provided the information.

Officials said that sources for the assessment are “information and evidence of connections to criminal agents in Afghanistan and elements of the Russian government.”

Democrats last year seized on news reports about alleged bounty payments to Taliban fighters to accuse President Donald Trump of being too soft on the Kremlin.

The New York Times reported last June that U.S. officials believed that Russian intelligence was paying Taliban fighters to target U.S. military personnel. The Times also initially reported that Trump was briefed on the situation, but did nothing in response to the Russian aggression.

Subsequent reports showed that U.S. officials were divided on whether Russia paid the bounties. The Times also softened its language about the level of confidence that officials had regarding payments. Trump himself questioned the accuracy of the report, while insisting that he had not been briefed about bounties.

Despite questions about the reporting, Democrats, including now-President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, blasted Trump for not retaliating against Russia, either through sanctions or other measures.

Hejazi died due to a “heart condition,” the IRGC statement said, without elaborating further.

For all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app.

Hejazi was appointed as the deputy commander of the Quds Force – the overseas arm of the IRGC – in January 2020 following the US killing of Iran’s top commander Qassem Soleimani.

Born in the 1950s in the city of Isfahan, Hejazi joined the IRGC soon after it was established in 1979. Over the years, he occupied several key positions within the force, including commander of the IRGC’s Basij militia and deputy commander-in-chief of the IRGC.

Hejazi also commanded the IRGC’s Tharallah base in the capital Tehran in 2009, which oversaw the suppression of protests in the city that followed Iran’s controversial presidential elections that year.

The Council of the European Union added Hejazi to its sanctions list in October 2011 for playing a “central role in the post-election crackdown.”

Hejazi also commanded IRGC forces in Lebanon for some time, according to the IRGC statement.

In recent years, Hejazi assisted Iranian and Iranian-backed forces in Syria using his “valuable experience,” the statement said.",217,1365,13,86

Moscow has repeatedly dismissed these allegations as lacking any proof and harmful for bilateral relations.

The United States sees Russia's announcement of response actions as ""escalatory"" and reserves the right to retaliate, a State Department spokesperson told Sputnik.

""Today's announcement by the Russian government was escalatory and regrettable,"" the spokesperson said on Friday. ""It is not in our interest to get into an escalatory cycle, but we reserve the right to respond to any Russian retaliation against the United States.""

On Friday, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced a response, which included barring eight current and former US officials from entering the country in retaliation for the new US sanctions and expulsions of Russian diplomats. Moscow noted that now is the time for the United States to demonstrate prudence by abandoning its confrontational stance toward Russia.

A new batch of sanctions was introduced by Washington over already long-standing allegations of interference in the US election and Moscow's alleged role in the SolarWinds cyberattack. Biden claimed on Thursday that he ""could have gone further"" with the sanctions, but ""chose to be proportionate"".

The Russian Foreign Ministry said the US government's actions were contrary to its declared intention to build pragmatic relations with Russia, and notified US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan that Moscow's retaliatory measures would be announced soon.

US-Russia relations suffered a downturn following Joe Biden's controversial remarks in an interview with ABC News in March. In particular, the US president threatened that his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin would ""pay a price"" for alleged election meddling and answered in the affirmative when asked whether he considered Putin a ""killer.""

0,(Canada) B.C. to officially request federal exemption to decriminalize drug possession,https://globalnews.ca/news/7757705/bc-official-request-federal-exemption-health-canada-decriminalize-drug-possession/,"Send this page to someone via email

On the fifth anniversary of declaring B.C.’s public health emergency for overdose deaths, B.C. will officially request a federal exemption from Health Canada to decriminalize personal possession of drugs.

Since April 14, 2016, the BC Coroners Service reports illicit drugs have claimed the lives of at least 7,072 British Columbians.

“Stigma drives people to hide their drug use, avoid health care and use alone,” Mental Health and Addictions Minister Sheila Malcolmson said.

“Through province-wide decriminalization, we can reduce the fear and shame that keep people silent about their drug use, and support people to reach out for help, life-saving supports and treatment.”

Officials with the B.C. Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions and Health Canada have been working on an agreement that outlines how the Province of B.C. will work with Health Canada to apply for a province-wide exemption to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, which governs simple drug possession.

Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, Chief Coroner Lisa Lapointe, Premier John Horgan and police chiefs across B.C. have been calling on the federal government to decriminalize simple possession of illicit drugs.

A new record high was set in 2020, with 1,724 lives lost in B.C. An additional 329 deaths took place in the first two months of 2021.

“Today, we remember and grieve the thousands of people who have lost their lives in B.C. due to a toxic illicit drug supply,” Lapointe said.

“I extend my heartfelt condolences to all of those who have lost a beloved family member or friend as a result of the unscrupulous and profit-driven illicit drug market. The tragic loss of these thousands of individuals underlines the urgent need for a substantial shift in our provincial and national response to problematic substance use.”

Lapointe and Henry have been pushing for access to a safer drug supply. This would also include additional addiction support for those seeking safe supply.

The province has put in temporary measures during the COVID-19 pandemic to allow better access to opioids through prescription. British Columbia has seen a spike in illicit drug deaths during the pandemic due to an increase in people using alone and disruption to the international supply of illicit drugs.

“The opposite of addiction is connection. More than ever before we need to connect with those using drugs with compassion and love. We need to be bold with addressing these complex issues” Henry said.

“We need to put the same resources in dealing with this crisis as we have with the pandemic.”

The province says since 2018, more than 6,000 deaths have been averted because of expanded access to overdose prevention services including wide availability and naloxone.

Currently, more than 23,000 people are receiving some form of opioid agonist treatment in B.C. – more than at any other time.

First Nations communities have been particularly impacted by the overdose crisis. The First Nations Health Authority (FNHA) reports between January and May 2020, 89 First Nations individuals died in B.C. due to illicit drug toxicity – a 93 per cent increase compared to the same period in 2019.

During that period, 16 per cent of all drug toxicity deaths in B.C. were Indigenous people, who account for just 3.3 per cent of the province’s population.

“The data underscores the immense toll that illicit drug toxicity is having on the lives of Indigenous people and their communities in B.C.,” acting FNHA chief medical officer Dr. Shannon McDonald said.

“That the opioid crisis continues to wreak havoc on Indigenous people five years after the B.C. government’s declaration of a public health emergency on opioid use is a clear indication that there is still much more to be done to resolve this tragic public health issue.”",712,4433,11,86

The number of lives lost, as compiled by Johns Hopkins University, is about equal to the population of Kyiv, Ukraine; Caracas, Venezuela; or metropolitan Lisbon, Portugal. It is bigger than Chicago (2.7 million) and equivalent to Philadelphia and Dallas combined.

And the true number is believed to be significantly higher because of possible government concealment and the many cases overlooked in the early stages of the outbreak that began in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019.

When the world back in January passed the bleak threshold of 2 million deaths, immunization drives had just started in Europe and the United States. Today, they are underway in more than 190 countries, though progress in bringing the virus under control varies widely.

While the campaigns in the U.S. and Britain have hit their stride and people and businesses there are beginning to contemplate life after the pandemic, other places, mostly poorer countries but some rich ones as well, are lagging behind in putting shots in arms and have imposed new lockdowns and other restrictions as virus cases soar.

Worldwide, deaths are on the rise again, running at around 12,000 per day on average, and new cases are climbing too, eclipsing 700,000 a day.

“This is not the situation we want to be in 16 months into a pandemic, where we have proven control measures,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, one of the World Health Organization’s leaders on Covid-19.

In Brazil, where deaths are running at about 3,000 per day, accounting for one-quarter of the lives lost worldwide in recent weeks, the crisis has been likened to a “raging inferno” by one WHO official. A more contagious variant of the virus has been rampaging across the country.

As cases surge, hospitals are running out of critical sedatives. As a result, there have been reports of some doctors diluting what supplies remain and even tying patients to their beds while breathing tubes are pushed down their throats.

The slow vaccine rollout has crushed Brazilians’ pride in their own history of carrying out huge immunization campaigns that were the envy of the developing world.

Taking cues from President Jair Bolsonaro, who has likened the virus to little more than a flu, his Health Ministry for months bet big on a single vaccine, ignoring other producers. When bottlenecks emerged, it was too late to get large quantities in time.

This situation is similarly dire in India, where cases spiked in February after weeks of steady decline, taking authorities by surprise. In a surge driven by variants of the virus, India saw over 180,000 new infections in one 24-hour span during the past week, bringing the total number of cases to over 13.9 million.

The challenges facing India reverberate beyond its borders since the country is the biggest supplier of shots to COVAX, the U.N.-sponsored program to distribute vaccines to poorer parts of the world. Last month, India said it would suspend vaccine exports until the virus’s spread inside the country slows.

Globally, about 87 percent of the 700 million doses dispensed have been given out in rich countries. While 1 in 4 people in wealthy nations have received a vaccine, in poor countries the figure is 1 in more than 500.

In recent days, the U.S. and some European countries put the use of Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine on hold while authorities investigate extremely rare but dangerous blood clots. AstraZeneca’s vaccine has likewise been hit with delays and restrictions because of a clotting scare.

In the U.S., where over 560,000 lives have been lost, accounting for more than 1 in 6 of the world’s Covid-19 deaths, hospitalizations and deaths have dropped, businesses are reopening, and life is beginning to return to something approaching normalcy in several states.

But progress has been patchy, and new hot spots — most notably Michigan — have flared up in recent weeks. Still, deaths in the U.S. are down to about 700 per day on average, plummeting from a mid-January peak of about 3,400.",737,4461,14,87
0,Canadian Parliament backs Halifax Security Forum's decision to honor Taiwan's president,https://news.yahoo.com/canadian-parliament-backs-halifax-security-184813329.html,"OTTAWA — Canada’s House of Commons unanimously passed a motion Wednesday in support of the Halifax International Security Forum’s decision to honor the president of Taiwan with a prestigious award.

“President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan is a well-respected international leader, female president of Taiwan and a strong global advocate for democracy,” Conservative MP Michael Chong said as he introduced the motion, which he said was created in consultation with all political parties. “She would certainly be an ideal fit for this award.”

The symbolic, nonbinding motion also calls on the Canadian government to maintain its funding of the international defense forum at current levels, even if its flagship John McCain Prize for Leadership in Public Service is presented to President Tsai Ing-wen.

The motion comes a few days after POLITICO reported that Canadian officials told HFX organizers that the government would pull its support from the event if the John McCain Prize went to Tsai. Canada is a top sponsor of the forum.

Canadian Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan has since denied that the Trudeau government threatened to withhold funding over the organizers’ plan for the award.

Sajjan, however, declined to answer Monday when pressed by Conservative lawmakers to say if he would endorse Tsai for such a prize. The minister told a committee hearing that HFX is independent and was free to make its own decisions when it comes to awards.

He was also asked whether he would commit to continuing to fund the forum regardless of whom the HFX chose to receive its prizes. Sajjan said he would take a look at the funding request as he does every year.

For several days, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government has also faced questions about the story in the House of Commons.

Earlier Wednesday, Trudeau was pressed by Chong during question period to commit to maintaining HFX funding, even if organizers awarded the John McCain Prize to Tsai.

Trudeau replied, “the government has supported and provided funding to the Halifax Security Forum throughout our time in office, and the minister has participated every year and will continue to.”

Story continues

The prime minister continued by saying that he has always supported Taiwan's “meaningful participation in multilateral international forums.”

“Canada continues to have strong and growing trade and people-to-people relations with Taiwan,” he said.

Trudeau ignored the preamble to Chong’s question in which he referenced details from POLITICO’s story. “The government’s attempt to silence those critical of China is shameful and it plays right into China's desire to silence its critics abroad,” Chong said.

Ottawa has avoided provoking Beijing after bilateral relations plunged over two years ago. In December 2018, Canadian authorities arrested Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on behalf of the U.S.

Beijing, angered by her arrest, has demanded her release. Meng, accused of breaking U.S. international sanctions against Iran, has denied any wrongdoing and is fighting extradition.

In an apparent retaliation, China arrested two Canadians — Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor — just days later and has since charged them with spying.

Multiple sources familiar with the matter told POLITICO that HFX organizers decided to give the 2020 award to Tsai. Cindy McCain, a member of the forum’s board of directors, approved the decision to honor Tsai with the prize named after her late husband.

When Canadian officials learned of the plans, they made it clear if organizers gave the award to Tsai, the Canadian government would yank its support — and funding — from HFX.

During Monday's committee hearing, a testy exchange suggested that Sajjan has concerns about the organization behind the forum.

The back-and-forth started when Conservative MP John Williamson asked Sajjan what he thought about HFX.

“I want to make sure you’re talking about the Halifax International Security Forum, not their office that they have in Washington. Is that correct?” Sajjan asked before getting an affirmative answer from Williamson. “Good, so just the event itself, not the office and not the employees that are former Conservative staffers that actually work in that office? Is that correct?”",669,4254,11,87

But Putin is racing to catch up.,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/russia-e2-80-99s-surveillance-state-still-doesn-e2-80-99t-match-china-but-putin-is-racing-to-catch-up/ar-BB1fKvTz,"© Natalia Kolesnikova/AFP/Getty Images A woman walks past a surveillance camera and a mosaic depicting the Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin at a Metro station in Moscow on March 10.

MOSCOW —Russian authorities are ramping up the use of facial recognition technology to track opposition protesters to their homes and arrest them — a powerful new Kremlin tool to crush opposition.

But when state security agents are suspected of murders or attacks on journalists and opposition activists, surveillance cameras have at times been switched off or “malfunction.”

And the system is so leaky that surveillance data on individuals can be bought for a small sum on Russia’s notorious black market in data, along with all kinds of other personal information. There is even a name for the clandestine cyber bazaar: probiv.

China leads the world in rolling out a vast network of facial recognition technology, including a system to track and repress its Uyghur minority. But Putin’s Russia is racing to catch up.

Russian firms such as NtechLab produce some of the world’s most sophisticated facial recognition software as authorities grapple with counterpunches by the opposition, including using social media to expose Russia’s kleptocracy, such as extravagances by Russian President Vladimir Putin’s political allies.

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said the facial recognition system — rolled out in Moscow en masse in January 2020 and expanded to at least 10 other Russian cities — is now used in 70 percent of crime investigations. Moscow has more than 189,000 cameras with facial recognition capabilities, as well as more than 12,300 on subway cars in Moscow’s Metro.

© KIRILL KUDRYAVTSEV/AFP via Getty Images Nikolai Grunin, an employee at NtechLab, the company that won Moscow’s tender to supply facial recognition technology, demonstrates the technology during an interview with AFP on Feb. 5, 2020.

“It is being used more and more against protesters and activists,” said Sarkis Darbinyan, a lawyer with Roskomsvoboda, a Moscow-based digital rights organization. “All these cameras scoop up the faces of people who go to a protest and then the information stays in the system.”

During protests in January and February over the jailing of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, Roskomsvoboda received more than a dozen reports of protesters arrested at home or in the subway, suggesting tracking by surveillance systems, Darbinyan said.

'Digital concentration camp'

Surveillance and facial recognition is increasingly used globally for law enforcement, raising alarm among civil liberties groups about privacy rights.

The FBI used facial recognition, surveillance video and other means to investigate the Jan. 6 attacks on the U.S. Capitol. In Britain, South Wales police lost a landmark case last year when an appeals court ruled that the technology violated a right to privacy and laws on equality.

But it’s a very different story in authoritarian states.

“Instead of the system being used for the benefit of the city, it is being used as a tool of total surveillance and total control of citizens,” said Sergei Abanichev, a protester who was jailed after being arrested using facial recognition.

He threw an empty paper cup in the direction of police at a protest in the summer of 2019, although he says he had no intention of causing harm. A week later, nine special forces police banged on the door of his apartment. He was charged with rioting and mass disorder. He served a month before the charges were dropped.

The ordeal was enough to deter him from taking part in this year’s protests, he said. Yet on Jan. 31, when more than 4,500 people were arrested during protests, police pounced on him in the Metro. They told him the Metro facial recognition system had activated a “high alert,” he said. He was interrogated for hours but eventually freed.

Spreading fear and deterring activism may be just the point for authorities, Darbinyan said.

“If somebody knows that he or she can be tracked down, they may change their behavior,” he said. “They may decide not to go to a rally, not to participate in a protest or maybe even not to go to the mosque for prayer, because they know that they can be tracked down.”

On Jan. 31, activist Kamil Galeyev was detained at his home three hours before a major protest started. The detention, he said, was based on photos of him through facial recognition from a Jan. 23 demonstration. He was jailed for 10 days.

Another activist, Mikhail Shulman, was picked up inside the Metro on Jan. 31 through facial recognition. It made him feel as if he lived in a “digital concentration camp,” he wrote in an article on Roskomsvoboda’s website.

Black market data

The facial recognition surveillance data goes into a central database, the Integrated Center for Data Processing and Storage, accessible by law enforcement and some bureaucrats. But corrupt officials sell data on Russia’s thriving “probiv” black market: flight records, cellphone records and other data.

It is used by Russian investigative journalists researching alleged abuses by officials, as well as criminals tracking potential targets and snoops checking up on rivals, spouses, employees or business partners.

“Often, it’s not the government or the authorities who have the access to the data, but criminals,” said Mikhail Klimarev, executive director of the Internet Protection Society, a nongovernmental organization exposing abuses of the Internet by Russian authorities.

© Mikhail Shulman Mikhail Shulman, a Moscow activist, in the city’s Metro. He was arrested in the subway system Jan. 31 through facial recognition, which is being increasingly used to track protesters to their homes and arrest them.

Authorities have begun to crack down on the probiv market, arresting a police officer for trading in data and investigating another.

Anna Kuznetsova, of Roskomsvoboda, saw several ads for facial recognition data on Telegram last year and paid $200 for access to data from 79 Moscow cameras, providing information on her daily routine, work and home addresses and her routes.

Journalist Andrei Kaganskih, of MBKh Media, bought five days’ access to data about himself from a number of cameras and an 80-page report tracking his face over one month. He reported that 30,000 rubles (about $400) could buy sweeping live access to all system cameras.

But the cameras are not pointed at everyone.

Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation analyzed an online Moscow city map of facial recognition cameras on buildings and found none on blocks where senior officials lived. The U.S. State Department sanctioned Russian officials and organizations last month over Russia’s near-fatal poisoning of Navalny last August.

The poisoning exposed how the state security services constantly surveil journalists and opposition figures — but switch off CCTV cameras when moving in for the attack.

Konstantin Kudryavtsev, a member of a clandestine biological and chemical weapons unit in Russia’s FSB security agency, confirmed the poisoning in a December phone call to Navalny, who posed as a senior security aide. When Navalny asked whether there was any chance someone on the poisoning team could have been caught on video, Kudryavtsev told him surveillance cameras were switched off in such operations.

He said: “Now cameras are everywhere, but even so when there are cameras we turn them off, you understand, right?” He added that “we always cut off any possibility of being captured. Maximum conspiracy — this is of utmost importance. No one should be seen.”

In another case, the Britain-based investigative online media outlet Bellingcat used flight and phone records from Russia’s data black market to find that Kudryavtsev and two members of the same FSB unit were in southern Russia around the time of the suspicious death of Timur Kuashev, a 26-year-old journalist and anti-torture activist in Nalchik in July 2014. Bellingcat published a letter from local traffic police to investigators stating that all the video cameras near the theater malfunctioned that night.

Kuashev’s body, with bruises on his face and the marks of an injection in his armpit, was found on a road to a forest nine miles from his home. The death was ruled to be heart failure.

The Internet Protection Society reported “a worrying new trend” after public access to real-time CCTV footage was switched off in six major Russian cities during the January protests. Klimarev said it seemed police wanted to prevent oversight of their actions to control the protests.

Human rights lawyer Kirill Koroteyev said there were no effective checks on how law enforcement used facial recognition and surveillance cameras.

“The system,” he said, “is designed so that there is no way to question how the system operates.”

REUTERS/Stringer

Opponents of Myanmar's junta announced a National Unity Government on Friday including ousted members of parliament and leaders of anti-coup protests and ethnic minorities, saying their aim was to end military rule and restore democracy.

Myanmar has been in turmoil since the Feb. 1 coup that ousted a civilian government led by democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi which had held power for five years and was starting its second term after a landslide election victory in November.

People have taken to the streets day after day to demand the restoration of democracy, defying crackdowns by the security forces in which more than 700 people have been killed, according to a monitoring group.

At the same time, political leaders, including ousted members of parliament from Suu Kyi's party, have been trying to organise to show the country and the outside world that they and not the generals are the legitimate political authority.

""Please welcome the people's government,"" veteran democracy activist Min Ko Naing said in a 10-minute video address announcing the formation of the National Unity Government (NUG).

While setting out few positions, Min Ko Naing said the will of the people was the unity government's priority, while acknowledging the scale of the task at hand.

""We're trying to get this out from the roots so we have to sacrifice a lot,"" he said, referring to the junta.

A spokesman for the junta could not be reached for comment.

The generals justified their takeover with accusations of fraud in the November election won by Suu Kyi's party, though the election commission dismissed the objections.

One of the unity government's primary objectives will be to win international support and recognition.

""We are the democratically elected leaders of Myanmar,"" said the unity government's minister of international cooperation, Dr Sasa, who goes by one name.

""So if the free and democratic world rejects us that means they reject democracy.""

International pressure has been building on the Myanmar military, particularly from Western governments that have imposed limited sanctions, though the generals have a long record of dismissing what they see as outside interference. read more

The unity government released a list of office holders including members of ethnic minorities and protest leaders, underlining the unity of purpose between the pro-democracy movement and autonomy-seeking minority communities, some of whom have battled the central government for decades.

CLAPPING IN THE DARK

Suu Kyi, who has been in detention since the coup, was listed as state counsellor, the post she held in government.

The only known communication she has had with the outside world since the coup has been monitored video calls with her lawyers.

A spokesman for the democratic politicians said while they could not inform her about their new government, he was sure she was aware of what was happening.

Sasa told Reuters the objective was to end violence, restore democracy and build a ""federal democratic union"". The military, while playing lip service to the idea of federalism, has long seen itself as the core power holding the country together.

Unity government leaders said they intended to form a federal army and were in talks with ethnic minority forces.

The Special Advisory Council for Myanmar, a group of international experts including former United Nations officials, hailed the creation of the NUG as historic and said it was the legitimate government.

After darkness fell over Myanmar's biggest city Yangon, people clapped at their windows and chanted ""our government"", video posted by activists on Twitter showed. Some community groups reported the sound of explosions and gunfire shortly afterwards.

While the politicians were announcing the unity government, other opponents of military rule observed a ""silent strike"" staying home to mourn those killed or wearing black in small marches in half a dozen cities and towns, media reported.

Yangon's streets were largely deserted, residents said.

There were no immediate reports of violence at Friday's rallies.

The military has also been rounding up critics and state media announced arrest warrants for 20 doctors on charges of encouraging dissent in the armed forces. The junta is seeking more than 200 people, including several internet celebrities, actors and singers, on the same change.

The turmoil has alarmed Myanmar's neighbours in Southeast Asia who have been trying to encourage talks between the rival sides.

Leaders of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which includes Myanmar, will meet in Indonesia on April 24 to discuss the situation, Thai and Indonesian media reported.

Junta leader Senior General Min Aung Hlaing was due to attend, a Thai broadcaster said, but the Jakarta Post said it had not been confirmed whether the summit would include representatives of the junta or the former government.

Sasa said ASEAN should not invite ""murderer-in-chief"" Min Aung Hlaing.

0,The Saudi Royal Family May Have Paid $450 Million For A Fake Leonardo da Vinci Painting,https://www.celebritynetworth.com/articles/billionaire-news/the-saudi-royal-family-may-have-paid-450-million-for-a-fake-leonardo-da-vinci-painting-a-painting/,"In November 2017, Christie's auction house offered a 500-year-old painting to the highest bidder. Officially titled ""Salvator Mundi"", but nicknamed the ""male Mona Lisa"", a 20-minute bidding war waged between a half dozen buyers from all over the world. Bids, which went up in $10 million increments, were made by billionaires and museum curators in China, the US, Qatar, Russia and Saudi Arabia.

Before the auction opened, the 500-year-old Leonardo da Vinci painting was estimated to sell for $100 million.

The final winning bid?

$450 million

That price more than doubled the previously-held record for most-expensive piece of art sold at public auction.

The previous record for a public art auction was $179 million paid in 2015 for Pablo Picasso's 1955 piece ""Women of Algiers (Version O)"". The buyer was former Qatari prime minister, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani.

The $450 million purchase also significantly topped the previously-held record for a private art sale. The previous known record for a private sale was $300 million paid in 2015 for a Paul Gauguin. The buyer in that case was a museum in Qatar.

After the smoke cleared, the winner of the $450 million da Vinci auction was revealed to be the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, AKA ""MBS"".

There's now a teeny tiny problem with MBS' $450 million ""Salvator Mundi"".

Upon closer investigation, it may not actually be a 100% authentic da Vinci.

This claim is according to a new documentary called ""The Savior for Sale"".

In the documentary, art analysts allege that although the painting was produced in one of da Vinci's workshops, the legendary genius might have, at most, only ""contributed"" to the painting.

$1,175

That's how much ""Salvator Mundi"" would have cost you in 2005.

""Salvator Mundi"" was sold for just $1,175 in 2005 by an art dealer in New York. That's not a typo. You could have bought this $450 million painting for a little more than half a ""stimmy"" check just 16 years ago. After undergoing a restoration, it was authenticated by several British art experts as a long-lost da Vinci.

It was then displayed at London's National Gallery as such. It sold in 2013 to a Russian oligarch for $127.5 million.

The oligarch was the seller in 2017 when MBS scooped it up for $450 million.

The painting has not been seen publicly since the sale. Most people assumed it was hanging on the wall of some Saudi castle or being stored at a highly-secure art warehouse in Switzerland.

In reality, it was indeed hanging on a wall. But not in a castle… on MBS' $500 million yacht ""Serene"":

And while Serene does have two helipads, a climbing wall, a dozen luxury cabins and three swimming pools, the art world was shocked to learn this is where a da Vinci was being stored. A yacht, even one that cost $500 million, likely does not have the required temperature controls or protection from salty air needed to store a 500-year-old painting.

After winning the auction in 2017, the original plan was to display the painting at the Louvre Abu Dhabi in neighboring United Arab Emirates for around two years. Then in late 2019 the painting was to be moved to the Louvre in Paris which was unveiling a massive exhibit to mark the 500th anniversary of Leonardo da Vinci's death.

A curator at the Louvre planned to display a history of the painting that included research which his team showed da Vinci at least painted the Christ figure in the painting.

That news was very well-received back in Saudi Arabia. It would essentially be a permanent stamp of approval proving they did not pay $450 million for a fake painting.

The documentary, ""The Savior for Sale"" claims that some members of the French government lobbied on behalf of Bin Salman, due to a concern over the strategic and economic relationship between France and Saudi Arabia.

In the end, President Macron denied Salman's request to give the painting an official stamp of approval from his government.

This left it to the Louvre to negotiate with the Saudi royal family.

Then a second major bone of contention popped up between the Louvre and MBS.

This bone of contention was related to the actual placement of the painting at the Louvre.

MBS insisted his painting be displayed nearly side-by-side with da Vinci's most-famous masterpiece, the ""Mona Lisa"". The Louvre refused, arguing that the Mona Lisa is held in a custom-constructed room that can barely accommodate the 30,000 daily visitors she sees today.

A compromise was not reached and MBS' da Vinci was shuttled back to an undisclosed location in Saudi Arabia where it will ultimately be displayed in a yet-to-built local museum.

As of this writing there has not been a 100% conclusion on the painting's authenticity.",803,4739,16,87

The development came a few days after POLITICO reported that Canadian officials told organizers of the forum that Canada would withdraw its support for the event if its flagship John McCain Prize for Leadership in Public Service went to Tsai. Canada is a top sponsor of the forum.

The parliamentary motion also directed the Canadian government to maintain its funding for the defense forum at current levels, even if Tsai were to receive the John McCain Prize.

Trudeau's challenge: The timing is complicated for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has been trying for more than two years to secure the release of two Canadians he says are arbitrarily imprisoned in China on “trumped-up” charges.

Canada-China diplomatic relations nose-dived after the arrest of Huawei senior executive Meng Wanzhou at Vancouver’s airport in December 2018 on a U.S. extradition warrant. Beijing has called the move political and demanded her release.

Meng, whose father founded the Chinese telecom giant, is accused of breaking U.S. international sanctions against Iran. She has denied any wrongdoing and is fighting extradition.

Days after Meng’s arrest, Chinese authorities seized Canadians Michael Kovrig, a diplomat on leave, and Michael Spavor, an entrepreneur. The men were tried separately last month on espionage charges and are awaiting their verdicts and, very likely, their sentences.

The global context: Much like the U.S., Canada’s “One China” policy means Ottawa doesn’t recognize Taiwan as a sovereign state, nor does it maintain official relations with Taiwanese government.

In recent months, Beijing has targeted Taiwan with a hybrid warfare campaign, including election interference, cyberattacks and drone intrusions into its airspace. The offensive has hurt the Taiwanese economy and fed fears of a full-blown invasion.

The HFX controversy: The Trudeau government, which has shied away from provoking Beijing since the Kovrig and Spavor arrests, appeared uncomfortable with such an award being given to Tsai at an Ottawa-sponsored conference in Canada.

Multiple sources familiar with the matter told POLITICO that HFX organizers decided to give the 2020 award to Tsai. Cindy McCain, a member of the forum’s board of directors, backed the decision to honor Tsai with the prize named after her late husband.

The forum’s website says the John McCain Prize is bestowed annually to individuals from any country “who have demonstrated uncommon leadership in the pursuit of human justice.”

When Canadian officials were told of the plan, sources say they made it clear if the award went to Tsai, the Canadian government would pull its support — and funding — from the forum.

Committee crossfire: Canadian Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan’s office initially declined to deny or confirm POLITICO’s report.

But on Monday, while under questioning by a parliamentary committee, Sajjan denied that the Trudeau government threatened to withhold funding over the organizers’ plan for the award.

Sajjan also declined to answer when pressed by his Conservative opponents to say if he would endorse Tsai for such a prize. The minister said that HFX is independent and free to make its own decisions when it comes to awards.

When asked whether he would commit to maintaining financial support for the forum regardless of who received its prizes, Sajjan would only say that he would take a look at the funding request as he does every year.

The PM's reponse: Each day this week, Trudeau’s Liberal government has been questioned about the HFX story in the House of Commons.

Before the vote on the motion, Trudeau himself was pressed Wednesday by Chong to commit to maintaining HFX funding, even if organizers awarded the John McCain Prize to Tsai.

“The government has supported and provided funding to the Halifax Security Forum throughout our time in office, and the minister has participated every year and will continue to,” Trudeau said.

The prime minister continued by saying that he has always supported Taiwan's “meaningful participation in multilateral international forums.”

“Canada continues to have strong and growing trade and people-to-people relations with Taiwan,” he said.",776,4965,13,87

Top intelligence officers from India and Pakistan held secret talks in Dubai in January in a new effort to calm military tension over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, people with close knowledge of the matter have told the Reuters news agency in New Delhi.

Ties between the nuclear-armed rivals have been on ice since a suicide bombing of an Indian military convoy in Kashmir in 2019 was traced to Pakistan-based fighters that led to India sending warplanes to Pakistan.

Later that year, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi withdrew Indian-ruled Kashmir’s autonomy in order to tighten his grip over the Muslim-majority territory, provoking outrage in Pakistan and the downgrading of diplomatic ties and suspension of bilateral trade.

But the two governments have reopened a back channel of diplomacy aimed at a modest road map to normalising ties over the next several months, the sources told Reuters.

Kashmir has long been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan, both of which claim all of the region but rule only in part.

Officials from India’s Research and Analysis Wing, the external spy agency and Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) travelled to Dubai for a meeting facilitated by the United Arab Emirates government, two people said.

The Indian foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Pakistan’s military, which controls the ISI, also did not respond.

But Ayesha Siddiqa, a noted Pakistani defence analyst, said she believed Indian and Pakistan intelligence officials had been meeting for several months in other countries.

“I think there have been meetings in Thailand, in Dubai, in London between the highest-level people,” she said.

Such meetings have taken place in the past as well, especially during times of crises but never been publicly acknowledged.

“There is a lot that can still go wrong, it is fraught,” said one of the people in New Delhi. “That is why nobody is talking it up in public, we don’t even have a name for this, it’s not a peace process. You can call it a re-engagement,” one of them said.

Both countries have reasons to seek a rapprochement.

India has been locked in a border confrontation with China since last year and does not want the military stretched on the Pakistan front.

China’s ally, Pakistan, mired in economic difficulties and on an International Monetary Fund (IMF) rescue programme, can ill-afford heightened tensions on the Kashmir border for a prolonged period, experts say. It also has to stabilise the Afghan border on its west as the United States withdraws.

“It’s better for India and Pakistan to talk than not talk, and even better that it should be done quietly than in a glare of publicity,” said Myra MacDonald, a former Reuters journalist who has just published a book on India, Pakistan and war on the frontiers of Kashmir.

“… But I don’t see it going very far beyond a basic management of tensions, possibly to tide both countries over a difficult period – Pakistan needs to address the fallout of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, while India has to confront a far more volatile situation on its disputed frontier with China.”

Following the January meeting, India and Pakistan announced they would stop cross-border shooting along the Line of Control (LoC) dividing Kashmir which has left dozens of civilians dead and many others maimed. That ceasefire is holding, military officials in both countries said.

Both sides have also signalled plans to hold elections on their sides of Kashmir this year as part of efforts to bring normality to a region riven by decades of bloodshed.

The two have also agreed to dial down their rhetoric, the people Reuters spoke to said.

This would include Pakistan dropping its loud objections to Modi abrogating Kashmir’s autonomy in August 2019, while New Delhi in turn would refrain from blaming Pakistan for all violence on its side of the LoC.

These details have not been previously reported. India has long blamed Pakistan for the revolt in Indian-administered Kashmir, an allegation denied by Pakistan.

“There is a recognition there will be attacks inside Kashmir, there has been discussions as to how to deal with it and not let this effort derailed by the next attack,” one of the people Reuters talked to said.

There is as yet, however, no grand plan to resolve the 74-year-old Kashmir dispute. Rather both sides are trying to reduce tensions to pave the way for a broad engagement, all the people Reuters spoke to said.

“Pakistan is transiting from a geostrategic domain to a geo-economic domain,” Raoof Hasan, a special assistant to Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, told Reuters.

“Peace, both within and around with its neighbours, is a key constituent to facilitate that.”",804,4896,14,87

The team of scientists who collaborated on the study stated the embryos were created as research for new ways to produce organs for organ transplants. However, the research has been controversial within the science community, with some bioethicists debating the ethics behind the creation.

""My first question is: Why?” Kirstin Matthews, a fellow for science and technology at Rice University's Baker Institute, told NPR. ""I think the public is going to be concerned, and I am as well, that we're just kind of pushing forward with science without having a proper conversation about what we should or should not do.""

The ethical concerns vary. One is that the research could go further and result in someone trying to create a fetus, in which the brain that develops would also be part human, part animal. Such entities are known as chimeras, stemming from Greek mythology.

""Should it be regulated as human because it has a significant proportion of human cells in it? Or should it be regulated just as an animal? Or something else?"" Matthews said. ""At what point are you taking something and using it for organs when it actually is starting to think and have logic?""

Another leading worry is the possibility it produces animals that then carry human sperm or eggs.

""Nobody really wants monkeys walking around with human eggs and human sperm inside them. Because if a monkey with human sperm meets a monkey with human eggs, nobody wants a human embryo inside a monkey's uterus,"" said Hank Greely, a Stanford University bioethicist. Greely co-wrote an article in the same issue of Cell critiquing this line of research, though he noted that the specific study in question was carried out ethically.

However, the scientists involved in the study stand behind their research and say it could be instrumental in solving one of medicine’s biggest issues.

""This is one of the major problems in medicine — organ transplantation,"" Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, a professor in the Gene Expression Laboratory of the Salk Institute for Biological Sciences and a co-author of the study, told NPR. ""The demand for that is much higher than the supply.""

In the research, Belmonte and a team of scientists injected 25 human induced pluripotent stem cells into the embryos of macaque monkeys, which share close genetic similarities to humans.

On the first day, researchers detected human cells growing within 132 of the embryos. The team studied the embryos for 19 days to gain insight into how human and animal cells communicate, with the aim of one day discovering how to grow organs in animals that can be used for human transplantation.

""This knowledge will allow us to go back now and try to re-engineer these pathways that are successful for allowing appropriate development of human cells in these other animals,"" Belmonte said. ""We are very, very excited.""

Organ transplantation is a cause for concern in the United States, with the need consistently outpacing the availability. According to the U.S. Government Information on Organ Donation and Transplantation, 39,000 organ transplants were conducted in 2020. As of February 2021, more than 107,000 were on the waiting list for an organ transplant, and 17 people die every day while waiting for one.

The coronavirus pandemic has caused heightened concern about the availability of organs for transplantation. The damage COVID-19 does on the organs, especially the lungs, combined with that of the long-term use of a ventilator in some patients has sparked a new wave of transplant patients.

New data released by the United Network for Organ Sharing found that 59 transplants due to COVID-19-related organ disease occurred in the United States through March 31. Of these transplants, 54 were lung transplants, four were heart transplants, and one was a combination lung-heart transplant.

“I think this is just the beginning,” said Tae Song, surgical director of the lung transplant program at the University of Chicago Medical Center. “I expect this to be a completely new category of transplant patients.”

That Russia placed ""bounties” on the heads of U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan was one of the most-discussed and consequential news stories of 2020. It was also, as it turns out, one of the most baseless — as the intelligence agencies who spread it through their media spokespeople now admit, largely because the tale has fulfilled and outlived its purpose.

The saga began on June 26, 2020, when The New York Times announced that unnamed “American intelligence officials” have concluded that “a Russian military intelligence unit secretly offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants for killing coalition forces in Afghanistan — including targeting American troops.” The paper called it “a significant and provocative escalation” by Russia. Though no evidence was ever presented to support the CIA's claims — neither in that original story nor in any reporting since — most U.S. media outlets blindly believed it and spent weeks if not longer treating it as proven, highly significant truth. Leading politicians from both parties similarly used this emotional storyline to advance multiple agendas.

The story appeared — coincidentally or otherwise — just weeks after President Trump announced his plan to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2020. Pro-war members of Congress from both parties and liberal hawks in corporate media spent weeks weaponizing this story to accuse Trump of appeasing Putin by leaving Afghanistan and being too scared to punish the Kremlin. Cable outlets and the op-ed pages of The New York Times and Washington Post endlessly discussed the grave implications of this Russian treachery and debated which severe retaliation was needed. “This is as bad as it gets,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Then-candidate Joe Biden said Trump's refusal to punish Russia and his casting doubt on the truth of the story was more proof that Trump's “entire presidency has been a gift to Putin,” while Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) demanded that, in response, the U.S. put Russians and Afghans “in body bags.”

What was missing from this media orgy of indignation and militaristic demands for retaliation was an iota of questioning of whether the story was, in fact, true. All they had was an anonymous leak from “intelligence officials” — which The New York Times on Thursday admitted came from the CIA — but that was all they needed. That is because the vast majority of the corporate sector of the press lives under one overarching rule:

When the CIA or related security state agencies tell American journalists to believe something, we obey unquestioningly, and as a result, whatever assertions are spread by these agencies, no matter how bereft of evidence or shielded by accountability-free anonymity, they instantly transform, in our government-worshipping worldview, into a proven fact — gospel — never to be questioned but only affirmed and then repeated and spread as far and wide as possible.

That has been the dynamic driving the relationship between the corporate press and the CIA for decades, throughout the Cold War and then into the post-9/11 War on Terror and invasion of Iraq. But it has become so much more extreme in the Trump era. As the CIA became one of the leading anti-Trump #Resistance factions — a key player in domestic politics to subvert the presidency of the 45th President regarded by media figures as a Hitler-type menace — the bond between the corporate press and the intelligence community deepened more than ever. It is not an exaggeration to call it a merger: so much so that a parade of former security state officials from the CIA, NSA, FBI, DHS and others was hired by these news outlets to deliver the news. The partnership was no longer clandestine but official, out in the open, and proud.

The first goal this story served was to weaponize it in the battle waged by pro-war House Democrats and their neocon GOP allies to stop Trump's withdrawal plan from Afghanistan. How, they began demanding upon publication of the CIA/NYT story, can we possibly leave Afghanistan when the Russians are trying to kill our troops? Would that not be a reckless abdication to the Kremlin of this country that we own, and would withdrawal not be a reward to Putin after we learned he was engaged in such dastardly plotting to kill our sons and daughters?

In late June, this alliance of pro-war House Democrats — funded overwhelmingly by military contractors — and the Liz-Cheney-led neocon wing announced amendments to the military budget authorization process that would defund Trump's efforts to withdraw troops from either Afghanistan or Germany (where they had been stationed for decades to defend Western Europe against a country, the Soviet Union, that ceased to exist decades ago). They instantly weaponized the NYT/CIA story as their primary argument.

The record-breaking $740 billion military budget was scheduled to be approved by the House Armed Services Committee in early July. In a joint statement with Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-TX) on June 29 — the day the NYT story appeared — Liz Cheney proclaimed that “we remain concerned about Russian activity in Afghanistan, including reports that they have targeted U.S. forces.” One of the Democrats’ most pro-war House members, Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), announced on July 1 (three days after the NYT story) his own amendment to block any troop withdrawal from Germany, citing “increasing Russian aggression.”

On July 1 and 2, the House Armed Services Committee held its hearings and votes — I watched all fourteen hours and reported on it in a series of articles and a 90-minute video report — and it not only approved this massive military budget but also both amendments to bar troop withdrawal. Over and over, the union of pro-war Democrats and Cheney-led neocon Republicans steamrolled the anti-war faction of left-wing and right-wing war opponents (led by Congressmembers Ro Khanna (D-CA), Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) and Matt Gaetz (R-FL)), and repeatedly used the Russia bounty story to justify continuation of the longest war in America's history. This little speech from Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA) was illustrative of how this CIA story was used all day:

The U.S. media was somehow more militaristic and blindly trusting about this CIA story than even this pro-war union of lawmakers. That the CIA’s leaked claim to The New York Times should even be questioned at all — given that it was leaked anonymously and was accompanied by exactly zero evidence — is not something that even crossed their journalistic minds.

These people who call themselves “journalists” do not view pronouncements from the U.S. security state as something that prompts skepticism let alone requires evidence before believing. The officials who run those agencies are their friends, partners and colleagues — those they most revere — and their every utterance is treated as Gospel. If — after watching them behave this way the last five years without pause — you think that is an exaggeration, watch this short video compilation produced by The Daily Caller to see for yourself how they instantly converted this CIA ""Russia bounty” leak into proven fact that nobody, least of all them, should question:

As usual, the media figure most loudly and dramatically enshrining the CIA leak about Russia as Proven Truth was the undisputed Queen of demented conspiracy theories, jingoistic rhetoric, and CIA propaganda: MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow.

Over and over, she devoted melodramatic segments to denouncing the unparalleled evil of Russian treachery in Afghanistan (because the U.S. would never pay bounties to kill Russian soldiers in Afghanistan), at no point pausing her histrionics for even a second or two to wonder whether evidence ought to be presented before telling the millions of #Resistance liberals who watch her show that she is vouching for the truth of this story.

Predictably, now that this CIA tale has served its purpose (namely, preventing Trump from leaving Afghanistan), and now that its enduring effects are impeding the Biden administration (which wants to leave Afghanistan and so needs to get rid of this story), the U.S. Government is now admitting that — surprise! — they had no convincing evidence for this story all along.

The Daily Beast on Thursday was the first to notice that “the Biden administration announced that U.S. intelligence only had ‘low to moderate’ confidence in the story after all.” The outlet added: “that means the intelligence agencies have found the story is, at best, unproven—and possibly untrue.” The Guardian also reported that “US intelligence agencies have only ‘low to moderate confidence’ in reports last year that Russian spies were offering Taliban militants in Afghanistan bounties for killing US soldiers.” NBC News went even further, citing Biden’s campaign attacks on Trump for failing to punish Putin for these bounties, and noting: “Such a definitive statement was questionable even then….They still have not found any evidence, a senior defense official said Thursday.”

The Daily Beast and NBC News, Apr. 16, 2021

What made this admission particularly bizarre — aside from rendering weeks of decrees from media figures and politicians humiliatingly reckless and baseless — is that the Biden administration continued to assert this claim as truth as recently as Thursday. When announcing new sanctions aimed at Moscow and diplomatic expulsions of Russian diplomats — primarily in response to allegations of Russian hacking — the White House said “it was responding to reports that Russia encouraged Taliban fighters to injure or kill coalition forces in Afghanistan.” The official White House announcement of the retaliation said explicitly that “the Administration is responding to the reports that Russia encouraged Taliban attacks against U.S. and coalition personnel in Afghanistan based on the best assessments from the Intelligence Community (IC)” — a claim for which the IC itself admits it has only “low to moderate confidence” is even true.

When asked about this glaring contradiction yesterday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki gave an answer that barely rose to the level of cogency, yet she clearly admitted the lack of evidentiary basis for this long-standing CIA/media tale:

That there is no evidence for this media-laundered CIA story is not something we learned only yesterday. It has been obvious for many months. In September, NBC News — as Maddow was in the midst of her performative sadness and indignation over the story on its cable network — noted:

Two months after top Pentagon officials vowed to get to the bottom of whether the Russian government bribed the Taliban to kill American service members, the commander of troops in the region says a detailed review of all available intelligence has not been able to corroborate the existence of such a program. ""It just has not been proved to a level of certainty that satisfies me,"" Gen. Frank McKenzie, commander of the U.S. Central Command, told NBC News. McKenzie oversees U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The U.S. continues to hunt for new information on the matter, he said. ""We continue to look for that evidence,"" the general said. ""I just haven't seen it yet.

That was what made the refusal to question this story all along so maddening. Not only was no evidence presented to support the CIA’s assertions — something that, by itself, should have prevented every real journalist from endorsing its truth — but commanders in Afghanistan were saying months ago they could not find convincing evidence for it. That is what The Daily Beast meant in Thursday’s report when it said “there were reasons to doubt the story from the start” — not just the lack of evidence but also that “the initial stories emphasize[d] its basis on detainee reporting” and “the bounties represented a qualitative shift in recent Russian engagements with Afghan insurgents.” NBC News on Thursday also said that “such a definitive statement was questionable even then.”

But these doubts were virtually non-existent in most media reports. Indeed, one of the New York Times reporters who broke the story publicly attacked me as a conspiracy theorist back in September when I cited that NBC News story about the lack of evidence while pointing out what a crucial role this uncorroborated story played in stopping troop withdrawal from Afghanistan and claiming Trump was beholden to Putin. And while The Daily Beast on Thursday said there were reasons to doubt the story from the start, that same outlet was one of the most vocal and aggressive in pushing the story as true:

Even worse, other media outlets — led by The Washington Post — purported to have “independently confirmed” the NYT/CIA tale of Russian bounties. Twice in the last year, I have written about this bizarre practice where media outlets purport to “independently confirm” one another's false stories by doing nothing more than going to the same anonymous sources who whisper to them the same things while providing no evidence. Yet they use this phrase “independent confirmation” to purposely imply that they obtained separate evidence corroborating the truth of the original story:

For months, pro-war members of both parties and leading members of the NYT/CNN/MSNBC media axis pushed a story — an inflammatory, dangerous one — based on nothing more than the say-so of anonymous CIA operatives. How can anyone do this who knows even the bare minimum about what this agency does and what its function is: to spread disinformation not just to foreign countries but the domestic population as well? It is both mystifying and toxic. But for people who call themselves “journalists” to repeat, over and over, evidence-free CIA claims, telling those who trust them to believe it, is nothing short of repulsive.

If you think that, upon learning yesterday's news, there was any self-reflection on the part of the media figures who spread this, or that they felt chastened about it in any way, you would be very, very wrong. In fact, not only did few if any admit error, but they did exactly the same thing on Thursday about a brand new evidence-free assertion from the U.S. Government concerning Russia: they mindlessly assumed it true and then stated it to millions of people as fact. They are not embarrassed to get caught spreading false CIA propaganda. They see their role, correctly, as doing exactly that.

On Thursday, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, run by Biden’s Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, issued a short Press Release about its targeting of Russian-Ukrainian political consultant, Konstantin Kilimnik, with new sanctions. One sentence of this press release asserted a claim that the Mueller investigation, after searching for eighteen months, never found: namely, that “Kilimnik provided the Russia intelligence services with sensitive information on polling and campaign strategy” that he received from then-Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort.

Is it true that Kilimnik passed this polling data to the Kremlin? Maybe. But there is no way for a rational person — let alone someone calling themselves a “journalist” — to conclude that it is true. Why? Because, like the CIA tale about Russian bounties — a claim they learned yesterday had no evidence — this is nothing more than a U.S. Government assertion that lacks any evidence.

Do you think journalists learned the lesson that they just had rubbed in their faces hours before about the foolishness of assuming official statements to be true with no evidence? Of course that is a rhetorical question: too many to count instantly proclaimed that this story was true without spending an ounce of mental energy to question if it was or apply any skepticism. Here’s Maddow’s MSNBC comrade showing how this is done:

Do you see what Hayes just did there? It is vital not to lose sight of how irresponsible and destructive this behavior is just because it is now so common. He saw a Press Release from a U.S. Government agency, read an assertion that it contained in one sentence, had no evidence that this assertion was true, but nonetheless “reported” it as if it were proven fact to millions of people in a predictably viral tweet.

Hayes was far from alone. I cannot count how many employees of corporate media outlets did the same: read the Treasury Department's Press Release and, without pausing for a second, proclaimed it to be true. Indeed, the two MSNBC hosts who follow Hayes's nightly news program explicitly described this evidence-free Press Release as ""confirmation”— confirmation!

MSNBC's Rachel Maddow and Lawrence O'Donnell celebrating an evidence-free Treasury Department Press Release as ""confirmation,” Apr. 15, 2021

Let's set aside the absurdity of treating this as some shocking revelation even if it were true. Just like the oozing historical ignorance of pretending that there would be something astonishing about Russians paying for the killing of U.S. troops in Afghanistan when the CIA just last week explicitly boasted of having done the same to Russian soldiers in Afghanistan, what is this Treasury Press Release supposed to prove that is so breathtaking and scandalous: that the Kremlin could not possibly have obtained polling data about the U.S. electorate had Manafort not provided it to them? That they never would have known that Wisconsin and Pennsylvania were swing states without an elaborate plot of collusion to learn this from the Trump campaign?

But the far more important point is the U.S. media's willingness — their subservient eagerness — to obediently treat U.S. government pronouncements as Truth. Just like with the Russia bounty story, where there were ample reasons to doubt it from the start, the same is true of this Treasury Press Release. To begin with, if this were such a smoking gun ""confirming” collusion, why did the Mueller investigation after eighteen months of highly aggressive subpoena-driven investigative activity not discover it?

Let's express this as clearly as it can be expressed. Any journalist who treats unverified stories from the CIA or other government agencies as true, without needing any evidence or applying any skepticism, is worthless. Actually, they are worse than worthless: they are toxic influences who deserve pure contempt. Every journalist knows that governments lie constantly and that it is a betrayal of their profession to serve as mindless mouthpieces for these security agencies: that is why they will vehemently deny they do this if you confront them with this accusation. They know it is a shameful thing to do.

But just look at what they are doing: exactly this. These are not journalists. They are obsequious spokespeople for the CIA and other official authorities. Even when they learn that they deceived millions of people by uncritically repeating a story that the CIA told them was true, they will — on the very same day that they learn they did this — do exactly the same thing, this time with a one-paragraph Treasury Department Press Release. These are agents of disinformation: state media. And when they speak, you should listen to them with the knowledge of what they really are, and treat them accordingly.",3125,19213,14,87
0,India reports another record daily rise in COVID infections | Coronavirus pandemic News,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/16/india-reports-another-record-daily-rise-in-covid-infections,"India reports 217,353 cases in the last 24 hours – the eighth record daily increase in nine days.

India has reported a record daily increase of 217,353 COVID-19 infections over the last 24 hours, health ministry data showed – the eighth record daily increase in the last nine days.

Deaths from COVID-19 rose by 1,185 – the highest single-day rise in seven months – to reach a total of 174,308, the health ministry’s data showed on Friday.

With a total tally of nearly 14.3 million, India this week overtook Brazil to become the country with the second-highest number of cases worldwide after the United States.

India’s daily coronavirus caseload has doubled in 10 days, as authorities grapple with shortages of vaccines, treatments and hospital beds.

The Indian government said on Friday it will supply 17,092 MT of medical oxygen in a dozen states where the virus is surging, including Maharashtra and capital city of Delhi.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked state to source medical oxygen from industrial plants, as supplies across the country have fallen short of meeting a demand surge due to a record-increase in COVID-19 infections.

Vicious second wave

Having let its guard down with mass religious festivals, political rallies and crowds at cricket matches, India is experiencing a vicious second wave, recording almost two million fresh infections this month alone and forcing new restrictions in Mumbai, New Delhi and other cities.

Experts have raised concerns about the spread of more contagious and deadlier variants of the disease, particularly given widespread participation in religious festivals and political rallies.

A Lancet study this month estimated that India’s fatalities could double by June.

“The biggest fight we have is in the society … Over a period of time, people have adopted a casual approach,” Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said at New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences on Friday.

People bury the bodies of victims who died due to the coronavirus disease at a graveyard in New Delhi [Danish Siddiqui/Reuters] Several senior leaders and opposition lawmakers, including Modi and Congress’s Rahul Gandhi, have been holding large rallies for supporters amid elections in five regions, including West Bengal.

Visuals from the rallies have shown thousands of mask-less people crowded together and chanting slogans as they listen to speeches from politicians, in clear violation of social distancing and other COVID-19 norms.

Home Minister Amit Shah was scheduled to hold public meetings and roadshows in West Bengal on Friday.

Meanwhile, hundreds of people at a religious gathering in Haridwar in the north of the country tested positive for COVID-19 as tens of thousands of devout pilgrims jostled to take a holy dip in the Ganges.

The weeks-long Kumbh Mela festival, where ascetics bathe to wash away their sins, began earlier this month and officials have warned they expect cases to rise significantly. One local official called it a “super-spreader” event.

Vaccination drive

There are also growing calls for officials to speed up the country’s vaccination programme as hospitals are swamped with patients.

India has so far injected 115 million vaccine doses, the highest globally after the US and China, but that covers only a small fraction of its 1.4 billion people.

In the heat of the latest wave of infections, India has shifted from being a mass vaccine exporter to a major importer.

Officials abruptly changed the rules to allow vaccine imports to be fast-tracked, having earlier rebuffed foreign drugmakers like Pfizer. It will import Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine starting this month to cover as many as 125 million people.

India is also seeking to inoculate more of its population using domestically produced shots.

India on Thursday gave approval to the Haffkine Institute in the western Maharashtra state to begin producing Bharat Biotech’s COVAXIN shot, a move that is expected to help ease supply bottlenecks.

The country is currently administering COVAXIN and AstraZeneca’s vaccine, which is manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and branded as Covishield.

Disturbing trend

Indian hospitals are now struggling to cope, running short of beds, oxygen and coronavirus medicines like remdesivir.

In a new disturbing trend, doctors across the most-affected cities told AFP news agency they had seen an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients aged below 45 and suffering from more severe symptoms compared with last year.

“We are also seeing children under the ages of 12 and 15 being admitted with symptoms in the second wave. Last year there were practically no children presenting symptoms,” said Khusrav Bajan, a consultant at Mumbai’s PD Hinduja National Hospital.

Many crematoriums are also struggling, according to press reports.

“Since 9am, we have been waiting outside. Now it is 1pm and still, we need another two-three hours for our turn,” said one relative outside a Bengaluru crematorium.

“There are hundreds of people like us waiting here.”",798,5047,13,87

India's tally of total infections is second only to the United States, with experts blaming everything from official complacency to aggressive variants . The government has blamed failure to practice physical distancing.

The country has been producing oxygen at full capacity for each of the last two days but will have to turn to imports, with the health ministry saying it was planning to import 50,000 metric tons.

""The situation is horrible,"" said Avinash Gawande, an official at a government hospital in the industrial city of Nagpur that was battling a flood of patients, as were hospitals in neighboring Gujarat state and New Delhi in the north.

""We are a 900-bed hospital, but there are about 60 patients waiting and we don't have space for them.""

Maharashtra, home to the financial capital of Mumbai, began a lockdown at midnight on Wednesday, a move that spurred a rush to stockpile essential items in advance. The state, the country's most industrial, has been the worst affected by the pandemic.

At Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan (LNJP) Hospital in New Delhi, the country's largest facility treating COVID-19 patients, two or three patients were seen sharing single beds in some wards, a Reuters witness said.

COVID-positive patients - from a one-and-a-half-year-old toddler to many elderly - and their relatives kept streaming in to the emergency ward at LNJP, arriving by ambulance, car or auto-rickshaw throughout the day.

""Last year also we have not seen such a bad situation. This time the number is very high and increasing very rapidly, going (at a) very fast speed, so the situation is really alarming,"" said LNJP Medical Director Suresh Kumar.

""We are definitely overburdened... Today we have 158 admissions in Lok Nayak alone. All sick patients, all severe patients,"" Kumar added.

India has added 200,739 infections over the last 24 hours, health ministry data showed, for a seventh daily record surge in the last eight days, while 1,038 deaths took its toll to 173,123.

Despite injecting the third highest number of vaccines doses worldwide, India has covered only a small part of its 1.4 billion people.

India said on Thursday regulators would decide on emergency-use applications for foreign COVID-19 vaccines within three working days. India's ambassador to Moscow said deliveries of Russia's Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine to India were expected to begin before the end of April, the TASS news agency reported.

CURBS ORDERED IN NEW DELHI

In New Delhi, authorities ordered a weekend curfew, placing curbs on shopping malls, gyms, restaurants and some weekly markets.

Outside a major city mortuary, weeping relatives gathered in the hot sun, waiting for the bodies of loved ones to be released.

Forty-year-old Prashant Mehra said he had to pay a broker for preferential treatment before he could get his 90-year-old grandfather admitted to an overstretched government hospital.

""He died after six or seven hours,"" he said.

Supplies of oxygen ran short in places such as Gujarat, the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

""If such conditions persist, the death toll will rise,"" the head of a medical body in the industrial city of Ahmedabad told its chief minister in a letter.

Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries will supply 100 metric tonnes of additional oxygen to Maharashtra, a state minister said.

Between new variants and vaccine risks, now is not a good time to be expecting.

“If it’s possible, delay pregnancy a little until a better moment,” Health Ministry official Raphael Parente said during a news conference on Friday, warning that the P1 variant of the coronavirus prevalent in Brazil “acts more aggressively in pregnant women.”

Brazil has become one of the world’s coronavirus epicenters lately, with 13.7 million cases of Covid-19 recorded and 365,000 fatalities, a death toll second only to the United States.

Doubly alarming is the high number of babies dying of Covid-19 in Brazil. Between 518 and 1,032 infants under a year old have died with the virus since last February, according to varying estimates collected by the BBC. The country’s overall high rate of infection has been blamed for these infant deaths.

The so-called P1 variant of the virus is believed to be responsible for the country’s surge in infections, which, public health institute Fiocruz states, has brought the country’s healthcare system closer to collapse than at any time in the country’s history. First identified in the Amazon city of Manaus, the variant is highly transmissible and more likely to affect younger people. Moreover, scientists claim that the variant is more resistant to vaccines and antibodies.

While the virus itself may put pregnant women at risk, so too may vaccines. Britain’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advised on Friday that pregnant women should choose vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna if possible, as more real-world safety data on these shots exists.

“There is no evidence to suggest that other vaccines are unsafe for pregnant women, but more research is needed,” the JCVI added. Previously, expectant mothers were advised to err on the side of caution and delay vaccination.

Citing a report by the National Task Force for West Philippine Sea (NTF-WPS), the Homonhon Environmental Rescue Organization (Hero) said the Chinese ships found around the Union Banks and Pag-asa Islands were at least 60 meters in length and each capable of catching at least 1 ton of fish every day.

“The Chinese fishermen have been overfishing, depleting our marine resources,” said Villardo Abuene, Hero president, in a statement.

“They even sell their catch to our fishermen at a higher price,” Abuerne said.

Even some fishermen in Zambales province have reportedly stopped going to the Scarborough Shoal, a known rich traditional fishing ground of Filipinos in the West Philippine Sea, due to depleting fish catch in the area.

In the past years, fishermen in the province had been driven away from the contested shoal by Chinese coast guards and some Chinese fishing vessels.

“This is actually worse than invasion,” Abuerne said.

“Our fishermen are starving. They face hunger because of the Chinese,” he added.

Abueme has called on the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources to investigate China’s overfishing in the West Philippine Sea.

On Wednesday, the NTF-WPS said an estimated 240 Chinese vessels were seen spread throughout the West Philippine Sea during its latest sovereignty patrols last April 11.

Some 1,700 people braved the icy temperatures to take part in the sexy descent at the popular Sheregesh ski resort on Saturday, according to the organizers.

Despite the numbers being impressive, they fell short of a Guinness world record for the most crowded semi-naked downhill event, which was set at the same location a few years ago.

The reason for that is the Covid-19 pandemic, which prevented foreign guests from making it to the Siberian slopes this time.

Nonetheless, the Russian daredevils still had a lot of fun, while also getting a ton of cool content for their social media pages.

REUTERS/Jason Reed

Australia’s federal government and the state of South Australia have signed a A$1.1 billion ($851 million) deal to finance measures aimed at making energy more affordable and helping to curb carbon emissions.

Australia said in December it could beat its target for cutting carbon emissions under the Paris climate agreement by 2030 without counting credits from overachieving on its targets in previous climate pacts, marking a shift in policy for one of the world's biggest emitters per capita.

Under the agreement, South Australia will provide A$422 million and the federal government will spend A$660 million, A$400 million of which will be spent on ""priority areas"" such as carbon storage, electric vehicles, hydrogen and other projects aiming at reducing emissions.

""Families and businesses need affordable, reliable power. That is what reduces prices and creates jobs,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison said during a televised briefing while announcing the agreement.

""Australians also want to ensure we are doing everything we responsibly can to combat climate change.""

Premier of South Australia Steven Marshall said the deal will also help to deliver the infrastructure needed for electric cars and to generate new revenue for farmers from carbon reductions.

""This agreement is going to lower power bills for South Australians and create jobs in the fast-growing renewables industry,"" Marshall said.

But the agreement was criticised Mark Butler, who worked as minister for climate change under a previous Labor government.

""What we get is, bit by bit, little bits of announcements in particular states instead of a comprehensive national policy that will underpin investor certainty to transition Australia's energy future,"" said Butler, currently the shadow minister of health.

China poses the single biggest geopolitical test for the United States in the 21st century, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director William Burns has said, stressing that this threat is more serious than those from Russia during the Cold War.

Also read: In signal to China, U.S. raised India ties during Alaska talks

Mr. Burns made the remarks to members of the House Select Committee on Intelligence during a Congressional hearing on worldwide threats on Thursday.

“I think China poses the single biggest geopolitical test for the United States as far out into the 21st century as I can see,” Burns said.

“What distinguishes that challenge from an increasingly adversarial Chinese Communist Party from, for example, the challenge we faced with the Soviet Union during the Cold War, is that this challenge unfolds across a whole range of areas from military to ideological in terms of our values, economic and especially at its core competition and technology as well,” Burns said.

The U.S. and China are at odds over a range of issues from trade to human rights in Tibet, Hong Kong and China's western Xinjiang region, as well as over Taiwan, Beijing's assertiveness in the South China Sea and the coronavirus pandemic.

Responding to a question from Senator Peter Welch, Burns said that certainly, there are going to be some areas where it's in their mutual self-interest to work together. Climate change and nuclear nonproliferation are a few of those areas.

But there are an increasing and growing number of areas in which China poses a real challenge, he said.

During the hearing Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, the only Indian-American in the House Intelligence Committee, said China possesses substantial cyber-attack capabilities that have been identified with localised infrastructure disruptions in different countries, for instance, following the clashes between China and India on the Line of Actual Control.

“Recently, in the fall, there was a temporary blackout in Mumbai that folks may have associated with Chinese-based entities. Can you guarantee to us that the Chinese government cannot do to any city here what they may have done in other places on the earth?” he asked.

Congressman Adam Schiff, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee said that China and Russia have different capabilities and intentions, but both seek to challenge and disrupt and supplant the liberal democratic order built by the United States.

“We face challenges from these two nations across all domains, some of them very immediate, with Russia mobilising its forces along the border with Ukraine and China taking aggressive actions towards Taiwan. And we must confront persistent threats from nations like North Korea and Iran,” he said.

An executive order issued by President Joe Biden this morning makes clear that the United States will no longer sit on its hands in the face of Russian aggression, Schiff said.",491,3083,14,88

In them the 31-year-old father relives the spine-chilling scenes he witnessed as his Covid-hit body battled for survival in a Rio ICU. The six-month-old baby who appeared to be suffocating right next to him. The man urinating blood after his kidneys failed. The unnerving bleep-bleep-bleep of machines warning doctors that yet another life was on the line.

“It was agony. When you closed your eyes – God forgive me – but it was as if you were in hell,” said Castro, a systems analyst and devout Christian who fell ill in early March as Brazil was thrust into the deadliest month of a coronavirus disaster that has killed more than 365,000 people.

“I saw everything in there. Children, adults, young people, bodybuilders – the lot. All of them going through the same thing,” Castro recalled, rubbishing the idea that only elderly people were in danger. “If you’re a human being you’re at risk,” he said. “This disease is a total game of Russian roulette.”

When Covid first hit Brazil last February it was, as elsewhere, considered mainly a threat to the ageing or infirm. A year later, as Brazil grapples with by far the most traumatic phase of its epidemic, a troubling trend has emerged, as intensive care units fill with younger patients such as Castro, some seemingly battling more severe forms of the disease. An unusually high number of infant fatalities has also been reported with more than 1,000 Brazilian babies dying last year compared with 43 in the US.

Brazilians have been particularly shocked by the case of Paulo Gustavo, a 42-year-old television star who has spent the past month fighting for his life in a Rio ICU despite being previously fit and healthy. Last week, the Brazilian Association of Intensive Care Medicine said that for the first time, most Covid patients in ICU were under 40 – a finding echoed by frontline doctors.

“We’re seeing a really big increase in young patients,” said Pedro Carvalho, a critical care doctor from the country’s northeast whose hospital’s ICUs have admitted Covid victims aged 27, 28, 29, 32, 33 and 34 in recent days. Two were women who had just given birth. The wife of the 33-year-old patient is expecting their fourth child but he is on dialysis and his chances of survival slim. “It really feels like we’re at the eye of the hurricane and things are just getting worse and more intense,” Carvalho said.

Clarisse Bressan, a tropical medicine specialist working at Rio’s Fiocruz Covid hospital, said she had detected a similar shift in the last three weeks, including a disturbing rise in the number of pregnant women being admitted. “The average age really has gone down. One Friday we had more patients in their 40s than over-80s.”

“The patients seem to be suffering a more drawn-out illness. They deteriorate later – after 12 or 14 days rather than 10 – and I’ve seen young people with more symptoms,” Bressan added. “They don’t necessarily end up with more serious conditions but I’m seeing fewer completely asymptomatic young people than I did at the start of the pandemic.”

The explanation for the generational shift remains unclear, although some suspect a highly transmissible new variant linked to the Brazilian Amazon may be partly to blame. “It’s clearly connected to the P1 variant,” said Marcos Boulos, a infectious disease specialist from the University of São Paulo who believes the virus is now both spreading faster and hitting young people harder.

Boulos said the vaccination of older Brazilians partly explained the increasing proportion of younger patients in ICU. “But there’s no doubt young people are being [physically] more affected by this new variant. It’s unquestionable.”

“Sometimes … these young people will die after just a few hours or days with very acute, severe illnesses – and you won’t find any comorbidity or factor to explain why. It’s dramatic,” added Boulos, pointing to similar suspicions that the South African variant might be affecting the young more.

Bressan suspected behavioural factors were also at play, with younger Brazilians more likely to be frequenting places where they might be exposed to greater doses of the virus, more often. “It’s younger people who are going out to work, to parties, restaurants and nightclubs,” said Bressan, adding that many of the patients she was now seeing in their 40s were domestic workers, cleaners, retail workers and waiters. “People who absolutely have to leave home to work.”

Castro has no idea which variant brought him to the casualty of a hospital on Rio’s northern outskirts last month, with a raging temperature and a respiratory system on the verge of collapse. “My lungs were totally black,” he said, recalling how one doctor told him it was a miracle he had made it there at all. “You should be drowning on dry land,” the doctor said as Castro was rushed into an improvised ICU.

“It’s terrifying,” he said of what he saw inside. “It’s like those war films where you see a warehouse full of wounded people and say, ‘No this is just a scene from a movie – The Walking Dead.’ Only it’s for real. This is what’s happening.”

After a sleepless night, Castro was moved to a specialist Covid unit where he came within a whisker of death. His oxygen levels plummeted and he suffered a series of cardiac arrests, with his heart rate shooting up to 140 beats per minute, then back down to 40.

“I remember feeling something so strange that I’d never felt before. I felt so cold, so much pain. My chest hurt so much. I was coughing so much. Everything hurt. And then suddenly everything just stopped. The feeling I had was that I was going to die. I didn’t feel afraid any more. I didn’t feel pain. I didn’t feel the cold. I stopped feeling everything … it was as if my body had switched off … I felt I was dead.”

More than 66,000 Brazilians lost their lives last month and as many as 100,000 are expected to die in April with their country now the global epicentre of the pandemic. But somehow Castro survived, the inflammation and infection suddenly clearing over the next four days before he was allowed to return to his home in the Chatuba favela.

“Dude, this is a miracle,” Castro remembered his doctor telling him as he was discharged into the arms of his overjoyed wife and 20-month-old son, Arthur. “Your lungs are really badly damaged but you’ve beaten the disease.”

A month later, Castro said he still suffered occasional panic attacks and fatigue and was relearning how to breathe, walk and eat. A childhood friend was also struggling to recover after being taken off a ventilator. She was so weak she was using a walking frame to get around. “We’re talking about someone in her 20s, who exercises, eats well … and doesn’t have any major health problems and now she’s debilitated like a 90-year-old woman.”

Castro, who believes he was infected at a small family gathering, said he hoped telling his story would convince other young Brazilians to take fewer risks.

“Contrary to what they say, this disease is extremely aggressive. It does attack young people,” he said. “Maybe with you it won’t be so aggressive – maybe you’ll feel nothing. But the person next to you – your friend, your dad, your mum, your uncle, your aunt – they might never make it home.”",1317,7740,14,88

It comes a day after Denmark became the first country in Europe to abandon the jab over links with very rare blood clots.

Both the World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency have said the benefits of the vaccine outweigh its risks.

""There is now significantly more knowledge about the connection between the AstraZeneca vaccine and the rare and serious incidents of low platelets, blood clots and bleeding than when Norway chose to put further use of the AstraZeneca vaccine on pause in March,"" said Geir Bukholm, director of infection control at Norway's National Institute of Public Health.

""Based on this knowledge, we have arrived at a recommendation that the AstraZeneca vaccine be removed from the coronary vaccination programme in Norway.""

On March 11, authorities had suspended the rollout of the vaccine after a small number of people who had received the jab were hospitalised with a combination of blood clots and a low count of platelets, with three cases proving fatal.

Bukholm said that now, with ""significantly more knowledge"" about the connection between the AstraZeneca vaccine and rare incidents of blood clotting and low platelets, Norway should cease use of the vaccine.

The institute estimated that pulling distribution of the AstraZeneca jab would likely bring about a delay in overall vaccine rollout by two weeks.

Bukholm said that it had not been easy to come to that recommendation. However, he suggested he believe it was a necessary step.

Those who have already received the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine are expected to be offered another coronavirus jab as their second dose.

However, the country's public health institute said it would be offering more information on the specifics of the programme in the coming days.",300,1882,12,88

“This is the best news the South American football family could receive,” he added. “It’s a big step forward in beating the COVID-19 pandemic but it doesn’t mean we are going to let our guard down.”

Dominguez said the deal was brokered by Uruguayan president Luis Lacalle Pou and other Uruguayan officials.

He gave no details of how and when the doses would arrive or be administered but thanked Sinovac for “understanding that football is a key activity for the economy, culture and mental and physical health of South Americans.”

The agreement comes at a key moment for football in the region. The two main club competitions, the Copa Libertadores and Copa Sudamericana are underway and involve significant travel across a massive continent.

The Copa America is also due to kick off in two months’ time, with the tournament being co-hosted for the first time as both Argentina and Colombia are staging matches.

Collective decisions on genocide are uncommon but not unheard of in the U.K. parliament, which in 2016 declared that the Yazidis, an ethnic group in northern Iraq, had suffered genocide at the hands of the Islamic State.

But because next week’s motion involves potentially accusing a fellow member of the U.N. Security Council, rather than a non-state terrorist group, the political and diplomatic stakes are considerably higher.

The government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson has already expressed that only international courts should adjudicate such an issue, meaning the vote will be dismissed as non-binding and ministers are likely to abstain.

But if at least two-thirds of MPs vote to back the motion, as its organizers hope, the vote could nonetheless have a significant international impact and strengthen the global movement against forced labor in the Uyghur Region.

The Guardian reports:

The motion due to be included on the order paper on Thursday reads: “This house believes the Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minorities in the Xinjiang region are suffering crimes against humanity and genocide.” It also calls on the government to fulfil its obligations under the convention on the prevention of genocide and other instruments of international law to bring it to an end. The motion points out that two of the UK’s closest allies – the US and Canada – have declared it a genocide.

Over one million Uyghurs and other Turkic and Muslim people have been detained in the Uyghur Region since 2017, with many forced to work in camps and factories across China.

The campaign of oppression—which has also involved forced sterilization, separation of families, and cultural indoctrination—has been described as constituting genocide and crimes against humanity by numerous experts and observers.

International condemnation of the events in the Uyghur Region has been met with fierce backlash this year from China, which has boycotted brands and sanctioned politicians critical of its treatment of its Turkic minority.

But next week’s vote, which is scheduled for April 22, could further strengthen the U.K.’s resolve against the Chinese government.

The foreign affairs select committee, which is conducting an official investigation into the Uyghur Region’s detention camps, is also poised to recommend updating the 2015 Modern Slavery Act to include mandatory human rights due diligence.

Freedom United has been a vocal opponent of forced labor in the Uyghur Region for over a year and, since last summer, has campaigned as part of the steering committee of the Coalition to End Forced Labor in the Uyghur Region.

After a meeting of Australia’s vaccine safety investigation group on Friday, the Therapeutic Goods Administration said experts had concluded the case of the New South Wales woman, who died this week, “was consistent with causal association to immunisation”.

“In the absence of an alternative cause for the clinical syndrome, VSIG believed that a causative link to vaccination should be assumed at this time,” the TGA said in a statement.

The case is the third instance of the rare blood clotting disease linked to the vaccine in Australia but the first death. The TGA said the case had been “complicated by the patient’s underlying medical conditions, including diabetes, some other medical conditions as well as some atypical features”.

“In relation to this case, VSIG agreed that the case was consistent with causal association to immunisation although for this patient, anti-PF4 antibodies were absent,” the TGA said.

Anti-PF4 antibodies which activate platelets have been found in almost all other cases reported internationally of blood clots with thrombocytopenia associated with the AstraZeneca vaccine.

The TGA said despite the atypical clinical features and the negative antibody test a causative link to vaccination should be assumed.

Authorities said the woman had received the AstraZeneca vaccine on 8 April, before the government’s announcement that the Pfizer vaccine was preferred for patients under 50. She was admitted to hospital four days later and, according to local media reports, died on Wednesday.

Authorities including the prime minister, Scott Morrison, had earlier on Friday called for people not to jump to conclusions about the case, stressing that clotting events associated with the vaccine remained extremely rare and that the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risks.

In its Friday night statement, the TGA said there had been at least 885,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine administered in Australia, meaning the three cases of rare blood clotting equated to a frequency of one in 295,000 cases.

The UK regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, has concluded from its review of cases in the UK that the overall risk of the rare blood clots was approximately one in 250,000.

“The TGA is carefully reviewing all Australian reports of blood clots following the AstraZeneca vaccine and are requesting further information from reporters, where needed, to identify any further possible cases of [the clotting disease],” the regulator said.

“The overall number of reports received for blood clots following vaccination so far has been no higher than the expected background rate for the more common type of blood clots in Australia. These can occur in around 50 Australians every day separate to vaccination and are not related to the very rare TTS clotting disorder.”

Earlier this week, the TGA said a second case of a rare blood clot syndrome in Australia was “likely” to be linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine. The case came after a 44-year old Melbourne man also developed the syndrome earlier in April.

The TGA said those first two cases remained in hospital but were recovering well.",527,3351,13,89

Steve Jurvetson on flickr

Elon Musk's SpaceX beat out teams led by Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin and Leidos subsidiary Dynetics to win a nearly $3 billion contract to build NASA's next crewed lunar lander. ""It is one more step, in an exciting group of steps, that will get us to a sustainable human landing system to the moon,"" Kathy Lueders, the leader of NASA's human spaceflight program, said in the agency's announcement. SpaceX's contract is worth $2.89 billion. The Washington Post first reported SpaceX's win on Friday.

NASA last year awarded the three teams with $967 million and 10-month contracts to begin work on the lunar lander concepts under its Human Landing Systems, or HLS, program. SpaceX was awarded the least amount of those three, with $135 million. Meanwhile, Dynetics received $253 million and Blue Origin had won $579 million. NASA was expected to choose two of the three teams, making the sole selection of SpaceX a surprise given the agency's prior goals for the program to continue to be a competition.

Ms Clinton on Wednesday retweeted a post showing that Carlson’s anti-vaccine monologue had become the most popular post on Facebook, according to data from the tool CrowdTangle .

“In December, @facebook banned claims about #covid19 vaccines ‘that have been debunked by public health experts. And yet…” Ms Clinton wrote .

“Especially troubling given Republican men are currently most likely to say they’re not interested in being vaccinated,” she added.

On his Tuesday night show, Carlson speculated that if vaccinated people are still required to wear masks and practise social distancing, the vaccine must not work.

“If vaccines work, why are vaccinated people still banned from living normal lives?” the host complained. “So maybe it doesn’t work, and they’re simply not telling you that. Well, you hate to think that, especially if you’ve gotten two shots, but what’s the other potential explanation? We can’t think of one.”

Carlson has already faced intense criticism for his remarks, which public health experts say undermine confidence in the vaccines.

“That’s just a typical crazy conspiracy theory,” Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, told CNN . “It’s certainly not helpful to the public health of this nation or even globally.”

The three vaccines that have been approved for use in the United States are in fact overwhelmingly effective. In clinical trials, the Pfizer-BioNTech shot was found to be 95 per cent effective at preventing Covid-19, while that number was 94.1 per cent for Moderna and 72 per cent for Johnson & Johnson (but 86 per cent for preventing severe disease), according to Yale Medicine .

“Look at the data,” Dr Fauci said in response to Carlson’s comments. “The data are overwhelming in the three vaccines that have been approved for use in an emergency use authorisation: The J&J, the Pfizer, and the Moderna – you had 30,000, 44,000, and 40,000 people in the clinical trial with an overwhelming signal of efficacy. So I don’t have any idea what he’s talking about.”

Nevertheless, Carlson’s diatribe has proven extremely popular online. At the moment Ms Clinton posted her tweet, a Facebook post featuring his comments had clocked almost 600,000 views.

The Clinton Foundation , at which Chelsea Clinton is a vice chair, has worked actively to dispel misinformation about Covid-19 vaccines. Earlier this month, the Foundation released a booklet to help community and religious leaders educate their constituents about the shots. Vice Chair Clinton wrote the introduction.

“Some Americans still have questions and doubts about the COVID-19 vaccines, and are in search of guidance,” she wrote . “The Clinton Foundation has put together this toolkit to help facilitate conversations with members of your community, give people the facts around COVID-19 vaccines, and dispel any myths that might be discouraging them from getting their shot.”

0,Fierce Beijing critic Jimmy Lai jailed for 14 months over Hong Kong pro-democracy protests,https://abcnews.go.com/International/fierce-beijing-critic-jimmy-lai-jailed-14-months/story?id=77112720&amp;cid=clicksource_4380645_14_comic_strip_sq_hed,"Hong Kong's rebel media tycoon Jimmy Lai was sentenced to 14 months in prison in Hong Kong District Court Friday after being found guilty of charges related to pro-democracy protests in 2019.

Lai, a 73-year-old billionaire and founder of pro-democracy paper Apple Daily, has been remanded in jail since December.

In addition, Hong Kong's ""father of democracy"" Martin Lee, 83, was given suspended sentences for the Aug. 18 and Aug. 31 protests, which were sparked by a widely unpopular extradition bill, which would have allowed suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial. Anger over the proposed legislation grew into a broader call for democracy in the Chinese-ruled territory. The mass protests lasted for more than six months, plunging Asia's financial hub into crisis.

It represented the biggest form of resistance to the Chinese Communist Party in a generation.

The two are among a handful of other prominent activists and lawmakers charged with organizing and taking part in what authorities called unauthorized assemblies. At least four of the other defendants were jailed up to 18 months.

""The sentences handed down are incompatible with the non-violent nature of their actions,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. ""We will continue to stand with Hong Kongers as they respond to Beijing’s assault on these freedoms and autonomy, and we will not stop calling for the release of those detained or imprisoned for exercising their fundamental freedoms.""

It's the first sentencing for Lai, who has been denied bail in a separate national security trial. On Friday, prosecutors also added two more charges to Lai's national security case, related to his alleged assistance of fugitive Andy Li. Li was among 12 Hong Kong activists intercepted at sea by the Chinese coast guard during a failed escape bid last year. That case is adjourned until June 15, while another fraud case leveled against Lai will be heard in May.

Lai was arrested on Aug. 10 under the controversial national security law, which Beijing imposed on Hong Kong at the end of June to clamp down on the pro-democracy movement after last year's unrest.

The national security law targets succession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, but critics say it breaches the ""One Country, Two Systems"" framework, which is meant to guarantee Hong Kong people a degree of autonomy and freedom not afforded to the mainland.

There have been a wave of arrests and prosecutions of activists since the law came into effect, with many of the territory's most well-known pro-democracy figures either behind bars or in self-imposed exile.

Speaking with ABC News at his home while he was out on bail in September, Lai said that Apple Daily will push on, despite the odds.

Last week, Lai sent a handwritten letter to his colleagues, published in Apple Daily, from prison: ""It is our responsibility as journalists to seek justice. As long as we are not blinded by unjust temptations, as long as we do not let evil get its way through us, we are fulfilling our responsibility.""",507,3084,14,90

The EU agreed in July to tap financial markets in search of 750 billion euros ($898 billion) to distribute across the 27 nations and prop up their economies after the coronavirus shock. However, in order to receive these funds, countries have had to detail how they will be using them — a process that has not yet concluded. In addition, the German constitutional court threw a curveball at the process. Last month, it raised doubts about it and effectively halted the necessary legislative steps in Germany, before the funds could be released. ""We of course have followed quite closely the developments by the court ruling in Germany. To a certain extent they are stipulating what many critics say that there is a danger to implementing temporary measures in a permanent way,"" Gernot BlümeI, the finance minister of Austria, told CNBC on Friday.

I am convinced there will be no delay to be able to also emit those European bonds. Gernot BlümeI finance minister of Austria

The German court acted after a group called the Citizens' Will Alliance complained that the EU treaties did not allow the bloc to take on debt jointly. The German judges said that the federal government should ensure that borrowing at the EU level ""does not become a permanent solution"" — an opinion shared by Austria. ""I can understand what the German court said and in some parts I agree,"" he said, adding that Austria is ""a little bit more skeptical when it comes to a permanent mutualization of debts within the European Union"" in comparison with France and Germany. ""That's not what the Union was designed for. And we have now taken crisis combatting measures. But per (its) definition a crisis is a temporary situation, so the measures that we have put up to fight this crisis have also a temporary motive,"" BlümeI told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" Friday. There is another element needed before the funds can be released: All EU member states need to conclude the ratification process in their national parliaments. Austria is among the 10 EU nations that is yet to do that and without this, the EU cannot tap the debt markets. ""I am convinced there will be no delay to be able to also emit those European bonds because it is an important measure to re-boost the European economy,"" Austria's finance chief said when asked why his country had not taken this step yet.

""We have agreed on those measures, Austria is paying a big share of 12 billion euros into this pot and we do this because we think it is the right way to increase growth within the European market because all citizens of Europe will benefit from it,"" he added.

Nothing wrong with negotiating vaccines with Russia

Austria, just like other EU nations, has struggled to rapidly roll out Covid-19 vaccines to its citizens. But Chancellor Sebastian Kurz confirmed last weekend that negotiations to buy the Russian Sputnik V vaccine had concluded, even though this shot has not yet been approved by the European Medicines Agency. BlümeI said that Austria had followed the rules and ""tried to get more doses for vaccination, just to be quicker in recovering the economy and giving the people back their freedom."" ""I can't see anything wrong in doing so,"" he said. A few eastern EU nations, such as Hungary, have decided to go beyond the deals negotiated by the European Commission to purchase more vaccines themselves, even if these haven't received medical approval across the bloc. Speaking to CNBC, BlümeI said he is optimistic that in the next two to three months, Austria will have vaccinated all of its adult population who wish to receive a vaccine.",647,3794,15,90

At an extraordinary news conference on Saturday evening the minister of the interior, Jan Hamáček, said that the Prague government was expelling 18 members of staff at the Russian Embassy in the city who had been identified as working for the country’s secret services. The spies have 48 hours to leave the Czech Republic.

The Czech police on Saturday evening released images of two men wanted for serious offences. The two are Anatoly Chepig and Alexander Mishkin, the same Russian GRU agents believed to have carried out a failed assassination attempt using the poison Novichok in Salisbury in the UK in 2018.

The news outlet Respekt reported that the Czech police's organised crime unit had worked on the case for several years in cooperation with the BIS counterintelligence service and the Brno Regional Public Prosecutor's Office.

The Biden administration imposed a raft of new sanctions against Moscow on Thursday over alleged interference in the 2020 election, a colossal cyberattack against U.S. government and corporate networks, illegal annexation and occupation of Crimea, and human rights abuses. ""Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) took sweeping action against 16 entities and 16 individuals who attempted to influence the 2020 U.S. presidential election at the direction of the leadership of the Russian Government,"" the Treasury said in a statement. It also announced sanctions on five individuals and three entities linked to Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula and human rights abuses. In addition to the broad sanctions issued by the Treasury, the State Department announced it will expel 10 officials from Russia's diplomatic mission in the United States. The sanctions come following President Joe Biden's phone call this week with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, and as Russian force amass near the Ukraine border. Washington formally accused Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR — its top spy agency — of being behind the SolarWinds cyberattack publicized late last year, described by Microsoft President Brad Smith as ""the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen."" ""The U.S. Intelligence Community has high confidence in its assessment of attribution,"" the Treasury release said. The attack saw hackers gain access to the software used by thousands of government bureaus and companies. The penalties are also in response to a March report by the U.S. director of national intelligence that concluded Putin authorized attempts to interfere in the 2020 election in former President Donald Trump's favor. The Russian government denies all of the allegations.

Biden also signed an executive order Thursday that allows Washington to sanction any sector of Moscow's economy, significantly broadening the scope of sanctions authority. Under this new authorization, U.S. financial institutions are prohibited from conducting transactions in the primary market for new ruble or non-ruble-denominated bonds issued after June 14. ""When you remove U.S. investors from the primary market, it causes a broader chilling effect,"" said a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ""What you see is that Russia's borrowing costs rise, you see that there's capital flight and you see the currency weakens in tandem. And you know, that has an impact on Russia's growth rate and it has an impact on Russia's inflation rate,"" the official added. ""The President signed this sweeping new authority to confront Russia's continued and growing malign behavior,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement applauding the measure. ""Treasury is leveraging this new authority to impose costs on the Russian government for its unacceptable conduct, including by limiting Russia's ability to finance its activities and by targeting Russia's malicious and disruptive cyber capabilities,"" she added. One of those named in the new actions is Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian agent with ties to former Trump campaign boss Paul Manafort, who was convicted in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election. The FBI is offering $250,000 for information leading to Kilimnik's arrest, who is believed to be in Russia. Moscow prohibits the extradition of a Russian national to any country. Another senior administration official, who declined to be named, said that the White House was still hopeful for a ""stable and predictable relationship"" with Russia. ""We also want to be clear that we have no desire to be in an escalatory cycle with Russia, we intend these responses to be proportionate and tailored to the specific past activities, paths, actions that Russia has taken,"" the official said. The administration officials declined to speculate on possible retaliatory actions Moscow would take on the heels of the sweeping sanctions.

Worsening U.S.-Russia relations

Taking a tougher stance on Russia was one of Biden's foreign policy campaign pledges. The measures announced Thursday join a series of past moves: the Obama administration's debt financing restrictions for major Russian companies like Rosneft, and the Trump administration's ban on U.S. entities buying Russia's foreign currency government loans. ""Today's U.S. sanctions continue the general trend of worsening relations witnessed ever since the annexation of Crimea,"" Maximilian Hess, head of political risk at London-based advisory firm Hawthorn Advisors, told CNBC. ""The key portion"" of these sanctions, he said, ""is the barring of U.S. entities from the primary market for ruble-denominated debts by the Russian government."" However, Hess noted, this ""will not have a major impact, particularly given Russia's manageable debt load."" For Timothy Ash, senior emerging markets strategist at Bluebay Asset Management, the measures are far from harsh. ""It's like guys, come on, you need to do better than this,"" Ash wrote in a note following the announcement. ""Sovereign primary still allows U.S. entities to hold this debt. So U.S. institutions cannot buy Russian sovereign debt in primary issuance, but can get their Russian bank friends to buy it for them in primary, give them a fee, and then buy it in the secondary."" The ruble pared some of its losses Thursday against the greenback shortly after the sanctions news, trading at 76.3025 to the dollar at 4 p.m. local time compared with 77.0718 just before the details of the sanctions were announced.

REUTERS/David W Cerny/File Photo

The Czech Republic is expelling 18 Russian diplomats over suspicions that Russian intelligence services were involved in an ammunition depot explosion in 2014, its government said on Saturday.

The central European country is a NATO and EU member state, and the expulsions and allegations have triggered its biggest row with Russia since the end of the communist era in 1989.

Its actions could prompt Russia to consider closing the Czech Republic’s embassy in Moscow, a diplomatic source cited by Russian news agency Interfax suggested.

Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said in a briefing shown live on television that there was “well-grounded suspicion about the involvement of officers of the Russian intelligence service GRU... in the explosion of an ammunitions depot in the Vrbetice area.”

Several explosions shook the Vrbetice depot, 330 km (205 miles) southeast of Prague, in October 2014, killing two employees of a private company that was renting the site from a state military organisation.

Babis called the circumstances “unprecedented and scandalous”, while a Russian lawmaker cited by Interfax described his allegation as absurd.

The U.S. embassy in Prague said on Twitter that Washington “stands with its steadfast ally, the Czech Republic. We appreciate their significant action to impose costs on Russia for its dangerous actions on Czech soil.”

Acting Czech Foreign Minister Jan Hamacek said the 18 Russian embassy staff, identified as secret service personnel, would be ordered to leave within 48 hours.

LINK TO SKRIPAL POISONING?

Hamacek drew a parallel with the poisoning of Russian spy Sergei Skripal in Britain in 2018, and Czech police said separately they were searching for two men carrying Russian passports in connection with serious criminal activity in the names of Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov.

Those were the aliases used by two Russian military intelligence officers who British prosecutors charged with Skripal’s attempted murder. They and Moscow both denied involvement. [nL8N2MA0FD]

Hamacek said he had “decided to expel all personnel at the Russian embassy in Prague who were clearly identified by our secret services as officers of Russia’s secret services, SVR and GRU.”

The Interfax news agency cited Vladimir Dzhabarov, first deputy head of the upper house’s international affairs committee, as saying Prague’s claims were absurd and Russia’s response should be proportionate.

Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with a nerve agent in the English city of Salisbury in March 2018.

The attack prompted the biggest wave of diplomatic expulsions between Moscow and the West since the Cold War.

Czech police said Petrov and Boshirov, whose whose birth names British government documents have given as Alexander Mishkin and Anatoly Chepigas, had also used a Moldovan passport in the name of Nicolai Popa and a Tajik one issued in the name of Ruslan Tabarov.

Police said both men were believed to have been in the Czech Republic from Oct. 11 until Oct. 16, 2014, the day of the explosion. They were first in Prague and later in the eastern regions, which is where the depot is based.

Russia would not extradite them, Interfax said, citing an unnamed source.

“Russia’s main law prohibits the extradition to a foreign state of Russian citizens accused of committing a crime on the territory of a foreign state,” the source was quoted as saying.

Babis said the Czech investigation linked the suspects to a Russian military intelligence GRU unit 29155.

The New York Times reported in 2019 that 29155 was an elite unit inside the Russian intelligence system skilled in subversion, sabotage and assassination.

0,Why comparing blood clot risks from COVID-19 vaccines and birth control pills doesn’t work,https://on.mktw.net/3syug6B,"In the days since the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) called for a temporary pause in administering the Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +1.15% COVID-19 vaccine over several severe cases of rare blood clots, many people have attempted to soothe fears and offer context by listing other common habits that can increase the risk of blood clots even more.

Among the most popular comparisons has been the heightened risk of clots that women taking hormonal birth control pills face. And this, in turn, has led some people to question how much the medical community cares about women. The most common complaint: that the J&J jab was paused over a one in a million risk of severe blood clots for the general population, yet women have been encouraged to use oral contraceptives for decades even though 1 in 1,000 develop blood clots — which, it should be noted, is still rare.

But women’s health experts told MarketWatch that this isn’t a fair comparison for a couple of reasons. First, we’re talking about different types of clots here.

Dr. Jen Villavicencio, a fellow with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), told MarketWatch in a statement that it is “not appropriate” to compare the risk of clotting associated with the Johnson & Johnson COVID vaccine with the risk of clotting among some hormonal birth control methods. “The clotting syndrome that is currently being investigated by the FDA and the CDC is likely different from the type of blood clotting experienced with birth control,” she said.

Don’t miss: Johnson & Johnson vaccine pause: What to know if you got or scheduled the shot

Indeed, government health officials are investigating a type of blood clot called a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) among the J&J recipients. These clots formed in the draining veins of the brain, combined with a low platelet count, essentially causing a stroke. Hormonal birth control pills, on the other hand, raise the risk of blood clots in the leg that can break off and travel to the lung, causing a pulmonary embolism that blocks blood flow to part of the lung. The latter clots can be treated with anticoagulants, while the J&J clots cannot.

What’s more, there are many different personal factors that can raise or reduce the risk of developing a blood clot, such as: a family history of clots; high blood pressure; obesity; pregnancy; recent surgery; or recently suffering a fracture.

“Each one of us has different risk factors for the same medical intervention, whether it’s the Johnson & Johnson vaccine or whether it’s taking a birth control pill,” Dr. Gloria Bachmann, an OB-GYN and director of the Women’s Health Institute at Rutgers, told MarketWatch. “And there are benefits for both, and there are risks for both, and that’s where one has to evaluate the risk of this intervention, and what would be the risks of getting COVID.”

“ “The biggest risk at the moment is the COVID virus, not the COVID vaccine.” ” — Dr. Arthur Caplan

Plus, women on the pill are made aware of the risks beforehand, notes Dr. Arthur Caplan, director of NYU Langone’s Division of Medical Ethics. “Some women have suggested maybe people are indifferent to women’s health. I don’t see it that way,” he said. “Women I’ve known on birth control pills are well aware of the risk of clots. People assume the risk, and then decide they’re gonna do it.”

So while it may be helpful to get people to stop panicking about the J&J pause, or reports of rare blood clots among AstraZeneca AZN, -0.18% vaccine recipients, by showing just how many other medications and personal behaviors could be more likely to cause clots, directly comparing the rate of blood clots from birth control with the rate among recipients of COVID vaccines doesn’t really work. “Plus, different birth control pills have different amounts of estrogen and progesterone, and carry different risks of blood clots, so it’s not as simple as making a global statement,” said Bachmann.

Related: The expectation of perfection: Risk of blood clot from Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is 0.00009%

But it does resurface the important subject of what’s considered an acceptable risk in medicine — or in anything, really — and the risk-benefit analysis each one of us makes when we decide to take a medication to treat an ailment despite the possible side effects. And the science shows that the benefits of getting vaccinated against COVID outweigh the small risk of blood clots for most people. And that is similar to taking hormonal birth control pills. Bachmann notes that women on birth control enjoy a reduced risk of ovarian cancer, fewer anemia problems, more regular periods, as well as the prevention of unwanted pregnancies. (Pregnancy actually poses an even greater risk of blood clots than birth control pills, she added.)

In the case of COVID-19, the virus has infected more than 31.5 million Americans and killed more 565,695. Health officials are investigating six cases of severe blood clotting, all women, who received the J&J vaccine, including one who died.

What’s more, some 30% of COVID-19 survivors have reported persistent symptoms like fatigue, brain fog and difficulty breathing still plaguing them nine months later. Plus, a new study from researchers at Oxford University has found that people who contract COVID-19 are at far higher risk of developing blood clots than people who receive COVID vaccines. In fact, the risk of cerebral venous thrombosis after a COVID-19 infection is about 100 times greater than normal, and several times higher than after coronavirus vaccination or after the flu.

Meanwhile, 99.992% of fully vaccinated people have avoided getting COVID, CDC data shows.

The bottom line is that the fallout from catching COVID right now far outweighs the small risk of possible side effects from any of the vaccines that have been approved for emergency use authorization in the U.S. Problem is, people aren’t great at “translating risk into action,” as Dr. Andrew Pavia, the George and Esther Gross Presidential Professor at the University of Utah, recently told MarketWatch. Which could explain some conflicting behavior.

“I had someone come up to me today who said, ‘I won’t take that vaccine because it’s dangerous’ — and they smoke two packs [of cigarettes] a day!” Caplan said. Meanwhile, smoking cigarettes can increase the risk of both developing blood clots and suffering severe COVID-19 illness.

He’s among the doctors who fear that pausing J&J will increase vaccine hesitancy in the U.S. In fact, a recent poll conducted by The Economist and YouGov found that only 37% of respondents think that J&J’s vaccine is safe after the pause, compared with 52% who believed it was safe before the pause.

“I think the messaging should have been, ‘While we examine a possible association [with blood clots] that is serious but rare, keep vaccinating,’” he said. “I wouldn’t stop vaccinating myself or anybody in my family because of this possible association. I would not pull away from the Johnson & Johnson vaccine due to a less than one in a million risk of death.”

“The biggest risk at the moment is the COVID virus, not the COVID vaccine,” Caplan added.",1220,7347,14,90

A Spanish court has provoked outrage by acquitting a man of sexually abusing his 14-year-old stepdaughter despite the fact she gave birth to his child.

The Pamplona court accepted the defendant’s claim that the teenager had sat astride him while he was asleep on the sofa and engaged in penetrative sex. The man said he had no recollection of the supposed encounter as he had been very drunk that night.

Close to nine months later, in December 2018, the girl was admitted to hospital and gave birth to a child, something the accused claimed had been a complete surprise to him and the girl’s mother. Social services ordered a paternity test, which confirmed that the stepfather was the father of the baby.

The girl’s mother reported the father for alleged sexual abuse of her daughter, who initially said she had been raped in the street before changing her story to corroborate her stepfather’s claim that he had not been conscious when they had sex.

The judges, sitting in the same Pamplona court that in 2018 sparked massive feminist protests when acquitting the “wolf pack” gang rapists who were later found guilty on appeal, said that there was insufficient evidence to convict the stepfather.

However, the sentence also noted that the girl had “kept her head and eyes facing down” during the trial, “answering questions very briefly in a barely audible voice”.

Altamira Gonzalo, vice-president of the Themis women jurists’ association, said the verdict “takes us back to the kind of sentences we used to see in Spain in the 1950s or 60s, when there was complete impunity for men in the family environment”.

“The sentence beggars belief. The only thing the court valued is the accused’s right to the presumption of innocence. It has ignored its duty to protect a minor and the fact that the age of consent in Spain is 16,” Ms Gonzalo told The Telegraph.

Spain’s parliament this week passed a new child protection law backed by NGOs such as Save the Children, which estimates that only 15 per cent of family abuse cases in Spain are reported.

Cira García, a judge from one of Spain’s gender violence courts, said the sentence does not even consider the possibility that the girl may have changed her version of events in order to protect her stepfather.

“We are sick of criticising that children’s testimony is often not given credibility and they are accused of lying in court, but here the girl’s word is accepted without question to absolve the accused, even though her account of events is absolutely implausible,” Ms García told the online newspaper Público.",478,2824,14,90
0,One and done? Study suggests recovered Covid-19 patients may only need single vaccine dose,https://www.rt.com/news/521207-single-vaccine-dose-covid-survivors/,"Recovered Covid-19 patients showed significant antibody responses after just a single mRNA vaccine dose but apparently received little additional benefit following their second dose, promising new research has found.

Researchers led by E. John Wherry, PhD at the Penn Institute of Immunology took blood samples from 44 healthy individuals who received either the BioNTech/Pfizer or Moderna mRNA Covid-19 vaccine, both of which employ mRNA technology, 11 of whom had a prior Covid-19 infections.

Blood samples were taken at four stages both before and after receipt of the vaccines and the researchers noted something peculiar in the results; the Covid-free vaccine recipients, called Covid naïve, did not boast a full immune response until after their second dose but curiously, those previously-infected showed nearly full immune response after just one dose.

“These results are encouraging for both short- and long-term vaccine efficacy, and this adds to our understanding of the mRNA vaccine immune response through the analysis of memory B cells,” said senior author Wherry.

Response to vaccines in humans is twofold: rapid response in the form of antibodies, and longer-term immunity, courtesy of memory B cells, which profile intruders so the immune system knows to fight them off if they ever show up again in the future.

This latest study highlights differences in memory B cell responses in recovered Covid-19 patients as compared to the Covid naive.

“Memory B cells are a strong predictor of future antibody responses,” Wherry explained, adding that proper monitoring of memory B cell responses will play an important role in longer-term pandemic response and management, especially in the face of new mutations and variants.

The results suggest that only a single dose of the mRNA vaccines may be required to give recovered patients the necessary protection by triggering a maximal immune response from both antibodies and memory B cells, potentially freeing up supplies at some point in the future, amid a worldwide crunch.

The researchers noted that two doses were required to achieve full immune response among the covid-naive patients and this held true in analysis of antibodies against different variants of the coronavirus.

“Everyone has good responses to the vaccines. They work to protect people against Covid-19. But for those who may be worried about side effects, they are not necessarily a bad thing–they may actually be an indicator of an even better immune response,” Wherry said.

Larger-scale studies are continuing with a view to determining the best course of action in terms of dosage numbers, overall immune response and lasting efficacy over time.

0,Expect more deaths due to scant COVID-19 vaccine supply — Duterte says after Putin meeting,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1419915/expect-more-deaths-due-to-scant-covid-19-vaccine-supply-duterte,"MANILA, Philippines — President Rodrigo Duterte warned the public Thursday night to expect more coronavirus-related deaths due to the continuing unavailability of COVID-19 vaccine supply.

In his second ‘Talk to the People’ address this week following his video call with Russia Pres. Vladimir Putin, Duterte bared he did not know when the Philippines would get enough COVID-19 vaccines to inoculate all Filipinos.

“Itong vaccine na itong pinag-usapan natin ganito, wala sana ito kung mayroong vaccine available. Eh wala. Hanggang ngayon the word ‘unavailable’ is nandiyan. Unavailable because there are not — there’s no sufficient supply to inoculate the world,” Duterte said in a pre-recorded speech aired Thursday.

(We won’t be talking about vaccines if supply is readily available. But there is none. Until now, the word is ‘unavailable’. Unavailable because there’s not sufficient supply to inoculate the world.)

“Matagal pa ito. Sabihin ko sa iyo marami pang mamamatay dito. Hindi ko lang maturo kung sino,” he added.

(This will take long. I tell you, many more will die because of this. I just can’t say who.)

So far, the Philippines has recorded 15,594 deaths due to COVID-19.

In order to achieve herd immunity, the Philippines has targeted to vaccinate 70 percent of its population or 70 million people. But the country has only so far vaccinated over 1 million individuals.

Of this number, more than 162,000 individuals already received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.

The Myanmar military has reportedly suffered heavy casualties following attacks launched by the ethnic armed group the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) on a military base and convoy in Kachin State on Thursday.

On the morning of April 15 the KIA attacked a Tatmadaw (Myanmar military) base in the area of Nam Byu in Tanai Township. The base had been captured by the Tatmadaw from the KIA in 2018. Immediately after the attack, two military fighter jets launched airstrikes in the area.

A resident said, “There was heavy fighting in the area from 6 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. We saw the dead bodies of Myanmar soldiers being taken away by the Tatmadaw after the attack”.

“We were not able to count [dead bodies] because there were many soldiers guarding the area,” he added.

The military-controlled MRTV said that at least 100 KIA soldiers had launched an attack on the Nam Byu base at 6 am, and claimed that the Tatmadaw suffered no casualties.

KIA information officer Colonel. Naw Bu refused to give casualty details as he was unable to reach the area.

However, a KIA officer on the ground told The Irrawaddy that “We could not retake our base yesterday. We had to retreat because of the airstrikes. But I am sure that they lost many soldiers [during the attack]”.

At around 4am on Thursday the KIA also attacked a Tatmadaw convoy in Bhamo Township. The convoy was on its way to reinforce troops attempting to retake a strategically-located KIA base in Alaw Bum near the border with China.

The KIA said that that it used mines against 16 military trucks near Sihub village. One truck went up in flames and the Tatmadaw took casualties during the attack, according to the KIA.

KIA soldiers captured the Alaw Bum base on March 25. Since April 10, there has been heavy fighting between the Tatmadaw and the KIA as the regime’s forces have attempted to retake the base. The Tatmadaw has lost at least 100 soldiers during the fighting, including a battalion commander, despite using airstrikes on the KIA forces.

“There was no fighting this morning. But the Tatmadaw keep reinforcing their troops, so there will be heavy fighting in the coming days,” a KIA officer said.

On Friday morning nearly 300 people from Myothit, Konlaw and Num Laung villages fled their homes for a Kachin Baptist Convention centre in Momauk Township, after the Tatmadaw launched airstrikes and artillery attacks near the villages.

Clashes were also reported in at least two places in Putao Township. Fighting has intensified across Kachin State and northern Shan State since March 11, following the KIA’s refusal to recognize the military regime.

The KIA has attacked military and police outposts and has threatened to step up its attacks if the junta continues to shoot peaceful protesters across the country.

You don’t imagine women in lycra hotpants, crop tops and red berets twerking in front of veterans.

That is, not unless you were in Sydney on Saturday.

Footage has gone viral of the 101 Doll Squadron dance troupe performing at the launch of the navy’s $2billion warship the HMAS Supply.

But all is not quite as it appeared in national news coverage, Australian broadcaster ABC has been forced to admit.

It has apologised over its editing of the event, which suggested that the group shook their backsides in front of the navy’s top brass and other VIPs.

An ABC TV clip widely shared on social media appeared to show the chief of the defence force and governor general reacting to the dancers as they performed their energetic routine at the Garden Island naval base.

The defence force was criticised for sanctioning what was largely considered inappropriate entertainment, but it has since insisted that the dance was not part of the official naval ceremony.

And although governor general David Hurley was present at the event, he arrived after the dance show had ended, a spokesperson confirmed to 7News.com.au and other news outlets.

101 Doll Squadron has since hit out at the “deceptive editing” of the news clip, saying they felt “exploited” by the misleading coverage.

“We are very disappointed at the ABC’s deceptive editing of their video piece which cut to guests and dignitaries who were not in attendance, and shot from angles which could not be seen by the audience,” they said in a statement.

“We found this very creepy.”

The statement also condemned what they believed was the broadcaster’s “need to sexualise these women and their dance piece”.

“These are the images appearing in the media and the ABC have a lot to answer for in making us feel threatened and exploited,” they said.

The dancers said they found ABC’s coverage of their performance “very creepy” (ABC News)

Contesting the timeline presented in the news clip, the troupe clarified that they had performed before the formal event, and before the dignitaries arrived.

“A short piece taken out of context in what was a very long day performed before the official ceremony and before the arrival of dignitaries, and not part of it,” they confirmed.

“It was in no way meant to be disrespectful and we are hurt and disappointed it has been misconstrued that way.”

The ABC has now apologised over the controversial TV segment, saying a government MP had told the reporters that both the governor general and navy chief were present for performance.

“The video should not have been edited in that way and the ABC apologises to the Governor-General and the Chief of Navy, and to viewers, for this error,” the statement read.

The ABC has also added a correction to its original story, acknowledging that the video did not reflect the correct chronology of events.

The country’s prime minister Scott Morrison said he was ‘“disappointed” by ABC’s reporting.

“I am disappointed that this event was so misreported. I think that was disrespectful to the performers to suggest the governor general or others were in attendance in that way.

“I think standards have failed and so I think obviously defence will look at these matters and make what changes they wish to in the future. I will leave that to them. It is disappointing that Australians were so misled on that issue.”

The Sydney-based dance group have deleted their Facebook page and made their Instagram account private in the wake of the backlash.

The troupe, who specialise in dancehall and afrobeats, said they had worked on their choreography for Saturday’s event together.

They explained: “It was meant to bring an informal sense of celebration; a gift from one of our community groups to open a modern ship, with a modern dance form.”

The Ontario government has unveiled several new COVID-19 restrictions aimed at curbing record-high cases in the province, including increased police powers, provincial border checkpoints and restricting outdoor gatherings.

Premier Doug Ford made the announcement at Queen’s Park Friday afternoon.

“We’re losing the battle between the variants and vaccines,” he told reporters. Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: ""We're losing the battle between the variants and vaccines,"" he told reporters.

“The reality is there are few options left.”

Ford announced an extension of Ontario’s state of emergency and provincewide stay-at-home order until at least May 20 in line with recommendations made by doctors and scientists earlier in the day.

Outdoor gatherings will be restricted to household members only as of 12:01 a.m. on Saturday. Those who live alone can join one other household exclusively.

When it comes to capacity at big-box retailers, there will be a cap of 25 per cent.

Ford also ordered the immediate closure of recreational amenities, including playgrounds, tennis courts, golf courses, basketball courts, and soccer and baseball fields.

Effective at 12:01 a.m. on Monday, religious services, weddings and funerals will be limited to 10 people indoors.

Solicitor General Sylvia Jones told reporters checks will be put in place at the Manitoba and Quebec borders effective as of 12:01 a.m. on Monday. Visitors will be prohibited from entering and exiting Ontario with the exception of essential purposes such as work, medical care and the transportation of goods.

The Government of Quebec announced on Friday it would close its borders with Ontario in an effort to tighten movement between the provinces. The province’s public safety minister said in a statement on Twitter discussions are underway between the Quebec and Ontario governments.

To enforce the measures unveiled by the government, Jones said police and bylaw officers will now be able to stop motorists and pedestrians to ask them where they live and why they’re not at home. The new police regulations drew immediate condemnation from civil liberties activists.

The Canadian Civil Liberties Association said granting police the authority to stop and question anyone at random risks a “rash of racial profiling.”

“Random police stops during COVID are unconstitutional, presuming those outdoors or driving to be guilty,” Michael Bryant, head of the CCLA, said.

Ford also called on the federal government to “immediately tighten up international borders.”

Labour, Training and Skills Development Minister Monte McNaughton said the province will be shutting down non-essential construction on projects such as shopping malls, hotels and office towers.

“However there are still projects that are critical to our health like building our homes, hospitals, assessment centres and long-term care homes and we need to ensure those on these sites are being kept safe,” McNaughton said.

Beginning on Friday, McNaughton said 200 inspectors will be visiting more than 1,300 construction sites over the four weeks to ensure public health measures are in place.

He added law firms, accounting offices and other locations where employees could potentially work from home will also be inspected.

Meanwhile, during the news conference, Ford repeatedly blamed a lack of vaccine supply for the situation the province is in and announced officials will be boosting supply in hot spots by 25 per cent. However, Ford did not elaborate on how that plan will unfold.

“Would we be in this position if we were getting 300,000 vaccines back in February like the rest of the world? The answer is absolutely not. We wouldn’t be facing the crisis with ICUs, we wouldn’t be having shut down, we wouldn’t have the schools shut down,” he said.

“We need the vaccines … The feds need to get us the vaccines, bottom line.”

The new restrictions came as the provincial government unveiled new projection data on Friday indicating the only way to flatten the surge of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations is a six-week stay-at-home order and at least 100,000 doses of vaccine administered a day.

According to the documents, there has been a 67 per cent growth in hospitalizations related to the virus and a 51 per cent growth in ICU occupancy.

Officials also noted under every scenario, more vaccinations mean a faster resolution to the COVID-19 crisis in the long run.

This is a developing story that will be updated throughout the day.

Top, from left to right: Detained Protest leader Ko Wai Moe Naing, actor Zin Wyne, activist Daw Myo Aye. Bottom, from left to right: a final year medical student, singer Po Po, a final year medical student, a dental student.

About three dozen people, including a prominent protest leader, protesters, celebrities, activists and ordinary citizens, were arrested by the military regime on Thursday in four states and regions.

Regime forces arrested six medics during a crackdown on a protest column led by members of the medical community in Mandalay about 10 a.m. Thursday.

A least 20 other people in the neighborhood were arrested during the crackdown. The junta’s forces opened fire and destroyed motorbikes and vehicles.

About 10:30 a.m. the regime’s troops broke into a house in Shan State’s capital, Taunggyi, and arrested four people, according to state-based media.

About 11:30 a.m., workers’ rights activist Daw Myo Aye, director of Solidarity Trade Union of Myanmar (STUM), was abducted from her office in Shwepyithar Township. Four military vehicles with around 40 soldiers surrounded the office during the arrest. Her daughter wrote on her Facebook page that the troops also confiscated the phones of the staff in the office.

Veteran academy-award winning actor Zin Wyne was arrested in afternoon in Yangon. He was charged with allegedly inciting civil servants to join the civil disobedience movement and support the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH).

A group formed by elected parliamentarians ousted in the coup, the CRPH has been acting as a shadow government in opposition to the military regime.

Po Po, a famous singer who was also on junta’s wanted list for the same charge, was arrested about 3 p.m. She was taken from her house in Yangon by regime forces, her manager wrote on social media. Both celebrities participated in anti-regime protests.

Ko Wai Moe Naing, a prominent leader of the anti-regime protest movement in Monywa, Sagaing region, was beaten and dragged away by regime’s forces after having his motor scooter rammed Thursday afternoon. He had been leading daily motorbike protests against the military dictatorship. A female protester was also arrested along with him.

The Monywa People Strike Leading Committee announced after the arrest that they will continue to fight until the fall of the military dictatorship. They also called upon the military regime to respect detainees’ human rights and allow proper medical treatment.

On Tuesday, Ko Zaw Thurein Tun, president of Myanmar Computer Professionals Association in Monywa, and his pregnant wife were abducted together by plainclothes officers in Shwebo Township, Sagaing region.

A former journalist from Myitkyina, a news outlet based in Kachin State, was also arrested by plainclothes officers at her home.

According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which tracks detentions, the regime had detained more than 3,000 people and issued arrest warrants for 756 more.

The blueprint makes clear that, even before the ink is dry on many 5G contracts for broadband telecommunications, China and its networking giant Huawei are gearing up to ensure their vision of the internet goes global.

But Huawei’s plans for 6G and beyond make U.S. concerns over 5G look paltry: Huawei is proposing a fundamental internet redesign, which it calls “New IP,” designed to build “intrinsic security” into the web. Intrinsic security means that individuals must register to use the internet, and authorities can shut off an individual user’s internet access at any time. In short, Huawei is looking to integrate China’s “social credit,” surveillance, and censorship regimes into the internet’s architecture.

The New IP proposal itself rests on a flawed technical foundation that threatens to fragment the internet into a mess of less interoperable, less stable, and even less secure networks. To avoid scrutiny of New IP’s shortcomings, Huawei has circumvented international standards bodies where experts might challenge the technical shortcomings of the proposal. Instead, Huawei has worked through the United Nations’ International Telecommunications Union (ITU), where Beijing holds more political sway.

The appropriate place for a review of the New IP concept would be the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The IETF and other standards bodies are examining most of the technical changes to internet infrastructure that make up the New IP proposal, and these bodies have said it is premature to make a dramatic change without more information and consensus. Huawei’s plan to rebuild the internet from the top-down based on speculative-use cases – uses of the internet that might one day exist as opposed to an established use that current users or businesses are already clamoring for – bucks the logic of internet governance, which postulates that change should be incremental and based on established needs.

Authoritarian Blocs

Huawei’s and the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP’s) turn to the ITU is no surprise, even though the ITU’s jurisdiction does not include internet architecture. When it comes to internet governance, the CCP and other authoritarian regimes have long favored multilateral international institutions like the ITU over multistakeholder international institutions such as the IETF or the International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). Multistakeholder institutions are governed by a diverse array of representatives from industry, civil society, and government; multilateral institutions only provide voting power to national governments. In multistakeholder fora, civil society and industry representatives tend to favor a free and open internet, which dilutes the influence of national governments, many of whom are likely to favor a tightly regulated, censorable internet.

Authoritarian governments can marginalize private industry and citizens’ groups by working through multilateral fora such as the ITU, meaning the U.N. and the ITU will naturally be more receptive to proposals like New IP that grant national governments more control over the internet. In 2019, China and Russia leveraged a similar authoritarian bloc within the U.N. to pass a censorship-friendly cybercrime resolution. A comparable coalition of likeminded countries could help China push through the New IP proposal, shortcomings and all. Circumventing conventional internet-governance institutions in favor of the ITU also sets a precedent for future internet governance-related proposals to go through the ITU instead of more-balanced multistakeholder institutions.

What’s more, China has held the top position in the ITU for the last seven years. During his tenure as secretary-general of the ITU, Houlin Zhao of China has encouraged the expansion of the ITU’s mandate from just a telecommunications agency to a “technology agency” by working on technology unrelated to telecommunications such as internet architecture, the internet of things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI).

Organizing the U.S. Government for Success

Because of limitations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ITU’s World Telecommunication Standardization Assembly (WTSA-20), where New IP will be formally debated, has been delayed until February 2022. Therefore, Washington has time to prepare for, and confront, the first major referendum on New IP, even if it is in a less-desirable standards forum.

In its March 2020 report, the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission (CSC) highlighted another issue, the disparity between how the U.S. government engages at international fora like the ITU and the effort China is willing to make. In fact, New IP resulted in part from a previous U.S. abdication of presence and leadership, as the initial inquiry into the need for this new technology emerged out of a Huawei-dominated ITU focus group that lacked American input. This asymmetry in representation extends beyond that particular focus group. In the runup to the WTSA-20, China nominated representatives for management positions in virtually every ITU study group. Even when Chinese firms do not win leadership positions, China sends droves of meticulously prepared, synchronized delegations to push standards beneficial to Beijing and its national champions. By contrast, U.S. representatives appear to be prepared in an ad-hoc manner. The United States is officially competing for one-fourth the number of chairmanships or vice chairmanships as China at WTSA-20.

In past meetings, the United States has endeavored to keep the ITU focused on its appropriate areas of expertise (telecommunications) and stay away from intervening on other issues (the internet, artificial intelligence, blockchain, etc.) better suited to other standards bodies. The United States is correct to oppose ITU mission creep on principle. However, simply voicing principled opposition by itself is not enough to contain Chinese efforts to push ITU mission creep.

The CSC recommended that the United States make a concerted effort to compete with China on internet governance, and articulated that this effort will require (1) getting the U.S. government organized for success, (2) building effective public and private buy-in, and (3) working with like-minded international allies and partners.

Organized to Compete in International Fora

The first step is to get the U.S. government organized and resourced to compete with China in these fora. This requires the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) at the Department of Commerce, as well as the State Department and sector-specific agencies to work together to develop a strategic approach to dealing with issues like New IP at international fora. This will require increased funding for NIST. The establishment of a State Department Bureau for Cyberspace Policy, as laid out in the Cyber Diplomacy Act of 2021, would provide much of the organizational reform required. However, the State Department will require increased funding and focus to coordinate action and address the challenge of declining U.S. influence in internet governance and international digital standards.

A good first objective should be electing an ITU secretary-general who will respect the limitations of the ITU’s mandate and who is less amenable to government control over the internet. A U.S. representative, Doreen Bogdan-Martin, is running for the position in 2022. Even if Bogdan-Martin does not win the election, the United States should work to ensure the eventual winner will discontinue Zhao’s policy of ITU mission creep into areas such as New IP.

The worst-case scenario would be for Russia’s candidate, Rashid Ismailov, to win the secretary-generalship. Ismailov leads a delegation that routinely attempts to enhance the ITU’s power over internet governance at the expense of multistakeholder institutions. Ismailov is personally on record advocating for “providing governments and non-profit organizations with an opportunity to control activities” of ICANN, one of the most important multistakeholder bodies in internet governance. Ensuring Ismailov or a like-minded candidate does not win should be a top priority for the United States.

The second step toward ensuring the United States can compete effectively with China on internet governance is determining the optimal mix of incentives and prodding to get American firms to more actively represent U.S. interests. Historically, when the United States leaves engagement in international fora up to its private enterprises alone, American firms’ main incentive for participating becomes direct self-interest.

U.S. firms see limited incentives to make long-term commitments to slower-moving international fora such as the ITU’s standardization arm, the ITU-T. To put it another way, no firm wants to waste its resources playing defense against abstract, long-term threats such as Huawei’s plan to reinvent the internet. By contrast, Chinese firms receive financial incentives from the government to craft international standards and are publicly pressured into acting as a united front in these bodies.

This hands-off approach to public-private collaboration on the part of the United States is insufficient when it comes to international standard setting and is in part what allowed Huawei to assert influence in the standards bodies such as the ITU-T and 3GPP in recent years. U.S. government and industry must work together on the vast majority of issues where the two can agree and thus counter Chinese efforts.

Third, the United States needs to build coalitions of likeminded countries in internet-governance institutions. Strengthening ties and coordinating action with traditional allies is critical but insufficient. The United States also needs to find common ground with non-traditional partners that may not share U.S. values of an open internet but are also skeptical of a Chinese-led order. The 2019 Sino-Russian cybercrime resolution, which initiated the drafting process for a treaty that would enable governments to clamp down on free speech on the internet, passed in part because 34 countries abstained. Convincing countries like Mexico, Brazil, and the Philippines to oppose China’s power plays will be key to preventing initiatives like New IP from taking hold.

The United States cannot afford a similar failure to compete, as was the case in international fora associated with 5G development and international cybercrime. Chinese dominance in standardization will cost American firms market share and can open the door for more Chinese backdoors around the globe. Huawei dominance on New IP and 6G would not only create a less free, less interoperable internet, it would pave the way for authoritarian governments to gain expanded say over future changes to the internet for years to come.

The Chinese New IP proposal can be successfully contested, but only if the United States rallies its private-industry partners and like-minded international democratic governments to the cause. They must all work together to collectively rein in the threat of authoritarian governments using multilateral institutions such as the ITU to export their vision of the internet worldwide before it is too late.

0,Russia sanctions eight US officials and expels diplomats in retaliation for Biden's actions,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/16/politics/russia-retaliate-us-diplomats/index.html,"(CNN) Russia sanctioned eight senior US administration officials Friday, including FBI director Christopher Wray and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, one of several measures it took just a day after President Joe Biden announced sweeping sanctions against Russia and warned against a ""cycle of escalation.""

Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Friday that Russia will also expel 10 US diplomats, curb the activity of US nonprofit groups in the country, impose new limits on American diplomats and diplomatic outposts, and consider ""painful"" measures against US businesses in retaliation for Thursday's punitive actions by the Biden administration.

Lavrov also said the Kremlin has told the US Ambassador to Russia, John Sullivan, that he should return to Washington to hold ""detailed"" and ""serious"" consultations. Russia's ambassador to the US returned to Moscow in March after Biden said he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin to be a ""killer"" in a TV interview.

The moves are ""just a part of the possibilities at our disposal,"" the Russian foreign ministry warned in a statement on its website, and follow Thursday's announcement that Moscow will block foreign naval ships and state vessels in the Kerch Strait, the sea of Azov and parts of the Black Sea -- a move NATO and the Pentagon criticized. The foreign ministry statement added that the US should ""show prudence by abandoning the confrontational course"" and that ""not a single wave of sanctions will go unpunished.""

Friday's wave of Russian penalties comes in a week when Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking for the US and its NATO allies, expressed deep concerns about Moscow's military build-up along the border with Ukraine, and the US intelligence community said in an annual report that Russia ""presents one of the most serious intelligence threats to the United States.""

A US State Department spokesperson called the Russian steps ""escalatory and regrettable.""

""Our recent actions were proportionate and appropriate to Russia's harmful activities,"" they said. ""Today's announcement by the Russian government was escalatory and regrettable. It is not in our interest to get into an escalatory cycle, but we reserve the right to respond to any Russian retaliation against the United States.""

The Russian foreign ministry released a statement on its website Friday naming Wray and Haines, along with US Attorney General Merrick Garland, Biden's domestic policy advisor Susan Rice, Homeland Security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and the director of the US Federal Bureau of Prisons Michael Carvajal.

The statement also names John Bolton, former national security adviser to former President Donald Trump and former CIA Director Robert James Woolsey, Jr.

""Taking into account the unprecedented nature of the complications provoked by Washington in Russian- American relations, it was decided to deviate from the usual practice not to 'highlight' countermeasures publicly undertaken by the Russian side,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement.

The State Department has not responded to CNN's requests for comment.

Lavrov told reporters Friday that Putin's foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov recommended to Sullivan on Friday that he return to DC.

""The situation is quite multi-layered, it needs to be studied in detail,"" Lavrov said. ""Moreover, sometimes incomprehensible things happen in Washington. Or at least things that are not completely clear. Therefore, today Ushakov recommended Ambassador John Sullivan to go to his capital and hold detailed, serious consultations there.""

In a statement to CNN, Sullivan said the US embassy had not received ""any official diplomatic correspondence"" on Russian actions against the US.

""We have seen a message that appears on the website belonging to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and are reviewing the information therein, in consultation with Washington,"" the statement said. ""We have not received any official diplomatic correspondence providing details of the Russian government actions against the diplomatic mission of the United States of America in Russia.""

'Tit for tat'

Lavrov, speaking at a press conference in Moscow with his Serbian counterpart, described the measures as a ""tit-for-tat response"" to the Biden administration's Thursday announcement of sanctions to punish Moscow for its interference in the 2020 US election, its SolarWinds cyberattack and its ongoing occupation and ""severe human rights abuses"" in Crimea.

Those US penalties included the expulsion of 10 Russian diplomats in Washington, including ""representatives of Russian intelligence services,"" for the cyber hack and the election meddling.

""Ten diplomats were on a list the US side handed over to us asking to ensure their leaving the United States. We will give a tit-for-tat response to that. We will also ask 10 US diplomats to leave our country,"" Lavrov said.

""Some time ago, before the package [of sanctions] recently announced by Biden, the Americans added eight representatives of Russian structures, the Russian leadership, including the presidential administration and the Prosecutor General's Office, to the sanctions list,"" Lavrov said. ""Today we will publish a list of eight officials who represent the governing structures of the Washington administration. They will also be included in our sanctions list.""

The foreign ministry announced a slew of other measures that could make it hard for US diplomats to function inside Russia.

The State Department will be limited to sending only 10 employees a year to Russia for short-term assignments; the US embassy will be banned from employing Russian citizens or those from third countries; and Moscow is terminating a bilateral agreement that allowed US diplomats to travel around Russia without notifying the foreign ministry.

Lavrov also said the Kremlin ""will restrict and terminate the activities on our territory of American foundations and non-governmental organizations, which in fact, directly interfere in our domestic political life."" The foreign ministry said it would target ""American foundations and NGOs controlled by the State Department and other American government agencies.""

Tanya Lokshina, the Moscow-based Europe and Central Asia associate director at Human Rights Watch, said, ""For years now, the Russian government has been taking different steps to stifle the work of independent critical organizations, be they Russian NGOS or foreign NGOs,"" using laws, hostile media campaigns, harassment and painting them as foreign-funded or foreign-controlled.

Russia is also considering more ""painful"" measures against US businesses, Lavrov said, framing them as a response to sanctions the US placed on Russian sovereign debt and adding that for now, the Kremlin is keeping those steps ""in reserve.""

The Biden administration is barring US financial institutions from participating in the primary market for bonds issued by Russia's central bank and other leading financial institutions. US financial institutions weren't big buyers of Russian bonds, but their withdrawal from the market as potential buyers will still have an impact, said Gary Hufbauer, a former Treasury official and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

""For obvious reasons, we do not have comparable levers of influence on the United States of this scale,"" Lavrov said Friday, adding that ""our experts"" believe the Russian economy can handle it. ""In any case, we have found and will find a way out of any situation. But we also have the opportunity to take painful measures against American business. We will keep them in reserve,"" Lavrov warned.

Biden said Thursday that the sanctions against Russia were a proportionate response to cyber-attacks against the US and interference in two presidential elections, but also emphasized that ""now is the time to de-escalate"" tensions with the country.

Trying to avoid escalation

As part of Thursday's announcement, the US formally named the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service as the force behind the SolarWinds hack that affected the federal government and wide swaths of the private sector.

During remarks at the White House, Biden said that he told Russian President Vladimir Putin during a Tuesday phone call that he could have gone further. Biden said that while he wants to avoid escalating tensions, he made clear to Putin that he would not hesitate to take further action in the future.

""We cannot allow a foreign power to interfere in our democratic process with impunity,"" Biden said.

He added, ""I told (Putin) that we would shortly be responding in a measured and proportionate way because we had concluded that they had interfered in the election and SolarWinds was ... totally inappropriate.""

The 10 Russian diplomats who are being expelled are based in Washington, DC, and New York, and will have 30 days to leave the country, a US official familiar with the plans explained. Asked how the US chose the 10 diplomats who will be expelled, a senior administration official told reporters Thursday that those individuals ""were acting with a manner inconsistent with their status in the US,"" and declined to provide further details.

The Czech officials were given just a day to leave in a harsher than tit-for-tat response to a decision by the Czech government a day earlier to kick 18 Russian diplomats out of their country within 72 hours.

Prague imposed the punishment after accusing Moscow's intelligence services of the attack on the Vrbetice facility in October 2014, which left two workers dead.

The Kremlin has denied involvement in the blast - calling the allegation unfounded, far-fetched and absurd.

European Union foreign ministers will discuss the crisis at a pre-planned virtual meeting on Monday.

The hostilities are the gravest between Prague and Moscow since the end of decades of Soviet domination of eastern Europe in 1989.

They come as a recent build-up of Russian forces on Russia's border with Ukraine ratchet up tensions between Moscow and the West.

Tom Tugendhat, chair of the foreign affairs select committee, told Sky News the 2014 explosion in the Czech Republic was a ""war-like act"" and a ""direct attack on a NATO country"".

""I think we need to be dealing with Russia in the way that it deals with the rest of the world - which is harshly,"" he said, suggesting expelling ambassadors as well as diplomats.

The UK fully supports the Czech Republic, Dominic Raab said.

The UK stands in full support of our Czech allies, who have exposed the lengths that the GRU will go to in their attempts to conduct dangerous and malign operations – and highlights a disturbing pattern of behaviour following the attack in Salisbury. https://t.co/dv4rWDl91I — Dominic Raab (@DominicRaab) April 18, 2021

The foreign secretary said the Czech authorities ""have exposed the lengths that the Russian intelligence services will go to in their attempts to conduct dangerous and malign operations in Europe"".

He added: ""Russia must desist from these actions, which violate the most basic international norms.""

Czech police said they are hunting two alleged Russian military intelligence officers in connection with the 16 October 2014 blast.

The suspects are believed to have travelled into the Czech Republic on passports with the aliases Ruslan Boshirov and Alexander Petrov.

The UK said they are the same GRU officers - whose true identities are thought to be Anatoly Chepiga and Alexander Mishkin - accused of trying to kill former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia with a novichok nerve agent. That attack took place in the Wiltshire city of Salisbury three-and-a-half years later, in March 2018.

Russia has always denied involvement in the spy poisonings.

Image: Sergei and Yulia Skripal were attacked with a nerve agent in 2018

Chepiga and Mishkin even appeared on Russian television, using their aliases, to claim they were sports nutritionists, not spies, who happened to be in Salisbury as tourists on the day of the poisonings as they wanted to see its world-famous cathedral, in particular the spire.

But western security officials believe the pair are part of a GRU Russian military intelligence unit called 29155 that has been linked to a series of other attacks.

This includes a failed coup in Montenegro in 2016, the poisoning of a Bulgarian arms dealer called Emilian Gebrev in Bulgaria in 2015 and possible bounty payments to Afghan militants for killing NATO troops.

Christo Grozev, lead Russia investigator at the investigative website Bellingcat, said an order of weapons that was due to be sent from the Czech arms depot to Mr Gebrev in Bulgaria could have been the reason why the site was hit.

""On exactly the date that the explosion took place, there was a transaction closing, the loading of weapons or munition to Bulgaria being acquired by Gebrev. It seems that that particular transaction or inventory was being targeted,"" he said in an interview.

It is not clear who the planned end-customer was for the weapons or why that had allegedly attracted the displeasure of Russia. One theory is that they could have been bound for Ukraine, which at the time was locked in conflict with Russia, or headed for a NATO member state.

Mr Grozev said that the discovery of an email chain in recent months had alerted the Czech authorities to the link between the Skripal suspects and the arms depot.

The two men had allegedly travelled into the Czech Republic on 11 October under their Boshirov and Petrov fake identities.

They then adopted other fake personas in communication with the arms depot, with one pretending to be Nicolai Popa travelling on a Moldovan passport, and the other using a Tajik passport in the name of Ruslan Tabarov. They pretended to be representing the national guard of Tajikistan.

""These emails containing scans of their fake passports… were just discovered about three months ago by the Czech authorities who started looking into the reason for the Skripal poisoners to be in the Czech Republic,"" Mr Grozev said.

Bellingcat already had data showing that the two men had been in the country at that time. They just did not know for sure why.

Czech police have revealed that they arrived in Prague on 11 October before travelling to the region where the arms depot is located.

They left the Czech Republic on 16 October, the same day as the attack.

Six months after the depot bombing, Mr Gebrev, the arms dealer, was admitted into hospital after collapsing in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia. His son and one of this company's executives also fell sick.

Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said there was ""well-grounded suspicion"" about the involvement of officers of the Russian intelligence service GRU in the ammunitions depot explosion.

A diplomatic source cited by Russian news agency Interfax suggested the expulsions could prompt Russia to shut the Czech Republic's embassy in Moscow.

In the wake of the Salisbury attack, British police published a detailed photographic account of the two suspects' movements while in the UK.

0,More than 200 travellers fined for refusing to quarantine in hotels after landing in Canada,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/quarantine-hotel-covid-19-travel-canada-fine-1.5988378,"Len Desharnais says he believes Canada's hotel quarantine requirement for international travellers during the pandemic is a fair idea.

But shortly after arriving in Vancouver from Bangkok on March 18, he said he decided not to check into his quarantine hotel, because he felt proper COVID-19 safety precautions weren't in place based on his shuttle ride to the hotel and what he observed upon arrival.

""It's just a joke. It's not safe, as far as I'm concerned,"" said Desharnais.

He's one of hundreds of international travellers who have taken issue with Canada's hotel quarantine requirement, designed to help slow the spread of COVID-19.

As of March 30, 219 tickets have been issued to air passengers entering Canada who refused to quarantine at a designated hotel, said the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). The fine for violating the requirement is $3,000, said PHAC.

CBC News interviewed two travellers, including Desharnais, who say they defied the rules for safety reasons and have yet to receive a fine.

Traveller Len Desharnais says he decided not to check in to his quarantine hotel in Vancouver because he felt proper COVID-19 safety protocols were not being followed. (Submitted by Len Desharnais)

On Feb. 22, the federal government mandated that air passengers entering Canada must take a COVID-19 test upon arrival and spend up to three days quarantining at a government-approved hotel to wait for their test results. Passengers must foot the bill for their stay, which can cost up to $2,000.

Travellers who test negative can go home to finish their 14-day quarantine. Those who test positive will be transferred to a different designated government facility.

Desharnais, an Albertan who relocated to Thailand 10 years ago, was returning to Canada to do contract work as a safety adviser in the oil industry in Fort McMurray, Alta.

He said he grew concerned about checking in to his quarantine hotel after taking the hotel shuttle bus from the airport.

""It was right at that point where I got worried, saying that this was not a safe situation.""

Desharnais says he grew concerned about checking in to his quarantine hotel after taking the hotel shuttle bus from the airport. This photo does not depict the shuttle bus that Desharnais took. (Evan Mitsui/CBC)

Desharnais said the shuttle's driver handled travellers' luggage without wearing gloves or first disinfecting the bags; the shuttle was packed, so he wasn't physically distanced from other passengers; and there was no plexiglass between the passengers and the driver.

""He's been around so many passengers all day.… I got concerned.""

Desharnais said that after arriving at the quarantine hotel, an employee also took no precautions when handling passengers' luggage.

Current evidence suggests the main way COVID-19 spreads is through close contact with an infected person, but that it can still happen by touching a contaminated surface.

Desharnais said he made the decision to leave at this point and do his entire 14-day quarantine at a friend's home in Prince George, B.C.

""If you feel a job is unsafe, not only do you have the right, but you must refuse it. So I take that into my personal life also.""

'It's not about safety'

Fanny Lapointe said she, too, decided to skip the hotel quarantine requirement for safety reasons, and has yet to receive a fine for doing so.

""What is more secure, to go directly to your place and see no people, or go to the hotel and see many people?"" said Lapointe, who lives just outside Montreal.

Traveller Fanny Lapointe says she defied the hotel quarantine rule because she felt the cost for the stay was too high and that she'd be safer quarantining at home. (Fanny Lapointe/Facebook)

She said she flew to Las Vegas to attend a friend's wedding, and when she returned to Montreal on March 11, she went directly home.

Lapointe said she concluded she'd be safer quarantining at home after a friend who stayed in a quarantine hotel earlier that month told Lapointe that she was allowed to leave her room during her stay.

""She was able to do whatever she wants,"" said Lapointe, who also objects to the high price of the hotel stay.

""It's just to punish people who travel. It's not about safety.""

Several other travellers who stayed in quarantine hotels have also complained to CBC News about what they consider lax COVID-19 safety measures, including crowded waiting areas and quarantining guests freely leaving their hotel rooms.

""There was no security whatsoever, nothing to prevent us from leaving the room,"" said snowbird Bob Ardern of Lunenburg, N.S. He stayed in a quarantine hotel in Toronto in early April, after returning from a winter stay in Curaçao, a Caribbean island.

Public Health Agency responds

Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) spokesperson Tammy Jarbeau told CBC News the agency monitors the hotels by calling quarantining guests and periodically visiting the hotels to make sure they're adhering to the agency's health and safety requirements.

Jarbeau said hotel guests can also lodge complaints with PHAC.

""Hotels that do not adhere to the requirements set out by PHAC will no longer be used"" as a quarantine hotel, Jarbeau said in an email.

At this point, the government has approved 59 quarantine hotels, which are located near the international airports in Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto and Montreal, the only cities where international flights are currently allowed to land in Canada.

Watch: Some international travellers complain about their hotel quarantine stay:

Quarantine hotels problems include access to food, travellers say The National 2:07 Some Canadians who’ve had to stay at a mandatory quarantine hotel say they’ve been met with long delays, crowded waiting areas and issues accessing basic needs like food. 2:07

Jarbeau also said quarantining travellers are responsible for ensuring they stay in their hotel room. According to a government website, guests can leave their rooms for scheduled outdoor time, but must be escorted out by security.

In January, before the hotel quarantine rule took effect, 0.5 per cent of Canada's COVID-19 cases were associated with international travel , according to PHAC. That figure dropped to 0.4 per cent in both February and March.

The agency said these statistics are an ""underestimation"" of the actual numbers.

Hotel quarantine court battle

Both Lapointe and Desharnais said if they do receive a fine from PHAC for refusing to quarantine in a hotel, they will fight it.

""I already know lawyers and, like, I'm ready to contest it,"" said Lapointe.

The government's quarantine requirement is already facing a legal fight from the Canadian Constitution Foundation (CCF), a constitutional rights advocacy organization.

Last month, CCF launched a lawsuit in Ontario Superior Court alleging the requirement violates Canadians' constitutional rights, including the right to enter Canada and the right to liberty.

On March 22, a judge dismissed CCF's bid for an injunction that would suspend the hotel quarantine requirement while the case is before the courts.

In his decision, Justice Frederick L. Myers wrote that refusing the injunction was in the public interest by trying to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

However, Myers also said the constitutionality of the hotel quarantine requirement has yet to be determined in court.

PHAC said it couldn't comment on a case that's before the courts.",1202,7423,15,91

Syrians abroad will be “able to vote at embassies” on May 20, Hamouda Sabbagh said in a statement, adding that prospective candidates could hand in their applications from Monday.

Assad, who took power following the death of his father Hafez in 2000, has not yet officially announced that he will stand for re-election.

He won a previous election three years into Syria’s devastating civil war in 2014, with 88 percent of the vote.

Under Syria’s 2012 constitution, a president may only serve two seven-year terms — except for the president elected in the 2014 poll.

Candidates must have lived continuously in Syria for at least 10 years, meaning that opposition figures in exile are barred from standing.

Candidates must also have the backing of at least 35 members of the parliament, which is dominated by Assad’s Baath party.

This year’s vote comes after Russian-backed Syrian government forces re-seized the vital northern city of Aleppo and other opposition-held areas, placing Damascus in control of two-thirds of the country.

But the poll also comes amid a crushing economic crisis.

WASHINGTON: Acknowledging that India among other countries in the region has a significant stake in Afghanistan, the Biden administration has pledged to ask regional nations to do more to support Kabul even as Washington packs up from the strife-torn country by September 11 after a failed 20-year effort to defeat the Taliban .

US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, on his way to Kabul following the announcement of the American pullout, said during a stopover at the NATO headquarters in Brussels that despite some differences there are some shared interests across a number of countries, whether it is Russia, China, India, Pakistan , Iran, Turkey, and others, in not seeing Afghanistan descend back into civil war.

""The risks that that could pose to them, including potentially extremism and terrorism directed against them, refugee flows heading in their direction, drugs as well, all of those argue that countries will have an interest and also some influence with the parties in Afghanistan to try to keep things moving in a positive direction,"" he noted, without mentioning the Pakistani military's widely known and well-chronicled role in subverting Afghanistan through its Taliban proxies for its strategic goals.

""I think countries will now have to look hard at the interests that they have, look hard at the influence they have, and decide whether to use that in ways that ensure that Afghanistan is not a source of instability and a source of terrorism and extremism,"" he added, without elaborating.

Blinken was following up on similarly vague remarks by President Biden in a nationally televised address on Wednesday in which he said Washington ""will ask other countries in the region to do more to support Afghanistan, especially Pakistan, as well as Russia, China, India, and Turkey"" since they all have a significant stake in the stable future of Afghanistan.

Biden did not mention Iran, which has a long and unstable border with Afghanistan. The basket of countries also have different interests and stakes in Afghanistan, with India alone devoting huge resources in an effort to put the country on track to be a modern and plural democracy to account for its diversity.

The upcoming US pullout without specific plans to shore up a weak government in Kabul has caused concern in New Delhi, where there is apprehension that a vacuum, in the words of Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat, could create ""space for other disruptors.""

Afghanistan is a nation which is rich in resources, and there are nations ""that tend to exploit resources for their own benefit without the benefit going to the community of that nation,"" Rawat noted at the ongoing Raisina Dialogue 2021, calling on international community to ensure ""Afghanistan is for the Afghans.""

The thinly-veiled reference to Islamabad, whose well-known depredations in Afghanistan through its Taliban proxies, is largely being ignored in Washington, which in the words of one commentator lacks the ""scrotal fortitude"" to hold Pakistani generals accountable for nurturing terrorists. In the current Washington narrative, the US will deploy less visible but potent force such as Drones to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a terrorist haven - a goal that that did not succeed even when it had boots on the ground.

Driving His Wife to a Clinic,https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/twilight-zone/.premium.MAGAZINE-idf-troops-shot-and-killed-a-palestinian-his-crime-driving-his-wife-to-a-clinic-1.9715059,"The main street of the West Bank village of Al-Jib, on the way to the adjacent village of Bir Naballah, north of Jerusalem. Monday, April 5, 2:45 A.M., the early morning watch. The Israel Defense Forces raided Al-Jib three times that night. The soldiers parked their heavy, armored vehicles on the narrow traffic island separating the two sides of the road.

Three weeks earlier, on March 13, they had wrested a young Palestinian named Ahmed Ghanayem from his bed at night and detained him. Now they were back again to search his house and his family’s store, which is around the corner from Ahmed’s house. Two soldiers stood next to some cars parked on the median strip across from the store. Suddenly an old Toyota approached from the east. A soldier signaled the driver with a flashlight to pull over. The driver at first didn’t notice the flashlight, but his wife quickly shouted at him to brake. The car came to a stop about four meters from the troops. A short conversation and the car was sent on its way. But then a moment later, the soldiers began spraying it with dozens of rounds of bullets.

“If a person falls from a plane in the middle of the night, / only God alone can lift him up,” the poet Dahlia Ravikovitch wrote. If a person is traveling in a car in the middle of the night in the West Bank, only God can apparently save him. Osama Mansour was killed; his wife, Somaya, survived.

The attractive Al Badawi World Liquidation Sale store, across the street, sells clothing, footwear, perfume and kitchen utensils at bargain prices. A sign in the store says, in Hebrew: “Up to 50 percent off on the whole collection for club members.”

The soldiers came here for the first time that evening around 9:30 P.M. A sizable force in vans, Hummers and other armored vehicles. They searched Ghanayem’s home. Children and teens pelted them with stones, the soldiers hurled back tear gas and left the village – only to return at midnight. Again stone throwing, again tear gas, soldiers conducted searches in a few homes. Eyewitnesses had the feeling that the troops were planning something.

The soldiers left at 1 A.M. and were back at 2:30. Two vehicles, a van and a jeep, stopped on the traffic island across from the store. Two more armored vehicles were parked a few dozen meters away. There may have been more. The street was quiet now, so late at night. Two soldiers stood on the same median strip that we stood on this week when we tried to reconstruct the events of that night, step by step, with the aid of the Ramallah-area field researcher of the Israeli human rights organization B’Tselem, Iyad Hadad. Two eyewitnesses, Azam Malkiya and Bassam Iskar, had observed what happened from their apartments, on either sides of the street, with the soldiers in the middle.

The Mansours’ 2010 Toyota approached, a soldier signaled the driver to stop with his flashlight, the car came to a complete halt. According to the witnesses, the driver also turned off the engine. Somaya and Osama Mansour come from the nearby village of Biddu, once a hub for Israeli shoppers on Saturdays but not since the separation barrier went up there about two decades ago.

Somaya and Osama told the soldiers that they were on the way home from a clinic in Bir Naballah, as Somaya hadn’t felt well. The family had been stricken by the coronavirus: Osama got over it easily; his mother, Jamila, was confined for 25 days in the Hugo Chavez Ophthalmic Hospital in the town of Turmus Ayya, which had been converted into a hospital for COVID-19 patients; and Somaya suffered from various symptoms and rested at home. The worst was over, but that night Somaya felt unwell again. The Mansours’ son Mohammed also fell ill, but the other children weren’t infected.

Osama was a vegetable merchant who made the rounds of nearby villages in his car. The day we visited their home, Monday, would have been his 36th birthday. Two months ago he was released from prison after serving an 18-month sentence: He had been caught in Jerusalem without an entry permit and was already serving a suspended sentence. Somaya, 35, works as a seamstress in Givat Ze’ev, a settlement just north of Jerusalem. The couple have five children and live in a small house with an asbestos roof in the yard of Osama’s parents’ house.

When we arrived, Bisan and Nisan, 10-year-old twins in school uniforms, had just returned home from school. They are now fatherless.

A photograph of Osama is propped up on the television screen. On the last evening of his life he asked his mother what he could buy for Ramadan, which began this week. There’s still time, she replied. One of the last photos of him was taken next to the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem; he had snuck in to pray; later on he was caught and arrested.

Somaya, the widow, enters the room, dressed in black, accompanied by the twins. She is tall and impressive, soft-spoken and tear-less, though her face is pained and pale. Osama returned from work at 11:30 P.M. on April 4, and hurried to take Somaya to the clinic in Bir Naballah. Somaya relates that he always looked after her like that, taking her to a doctor for every ailment. The doctor, she says, told her she had to rest at home. Osama then suggested that they should drive around a little, as she’d been cooped up in the house all day. She recalls that he bought her a sandwich at a grocery store that was open in the middle of the night. They didn’t notice anything unusual going on until they saw the soldier with the flashlight signaling them to pull over. The soldier aimed his rifle at them and shouted, “Why didn’t you stop?” “Why are you shouting at me?” Osama, who knew Hebrew, asked in reply. The soldier asked where they lived and where they were coming from, but didn’t ask to see ID cards or vehicle registration documents.

The soldier told them to be on their way, and Osama drove off. A moment later, however, Somaya says that she heard the sound of a single shot from behind; immediately afterward a few soldiers darted out in front of the car and riddled it with gunfire. Somaya describes “a rain of bullets” that landed on them. Terrified, she bent forward to protect herself. She felt shrapnel striking her back. “Are you all right?” Osama called to her, and she said, “I’ve been shot.”

The car veered from side to side; Somaya realized that Osama had lost control of the steering wheel. “Why are you driving like that?” she asked him – but there was no longer an answer. Osama fell over onto his wife’s lap, his head oozing blood. Somaya started shouting, but kept her wits about her. From the passenger seat, she grabbed hold of the steering wheel and also stepped on the gas pedal, in an attempt to escape the nightmare. A few hundred meters later she stopped the car with the handbrake and even shifted into park mode. The soldiers did not follow them. Four young men driving from the opposite direction stopped and quickly transferred Somaya and Osama to their car. He was still breathing, but had lost consciousness.

They took Osama to the Al-Carmel Clinic in Biddu, where staff summoned an ambulance that rushed the dying man to the Government Hospital in Ramallah. Somaya was treated for light wounds and the physicians told her Osama was being operated on. At 4 A.M. he was pronounced dead, but Somaya wasn’t told until two hours later.

The soldiers got to the car they had peppered with bullets 15 minutes after the incident, and took it away. They then proceeded to the stores and apartment buildings in the immediate area and dismantled the security cameras, including the one in the Ghanayem family’s store – it is not clear for what purpose. They also took the trouble to collect their shell casings from the street – the witnesses reported that about 50 rounds had been fired at the Mansours’ car. Hadad, from B’Tselem, found seven casings the soldiers had missed.

Osama’s body was transferred to the forensic medicine institute in Abu Dis, outside Jerusalem, where a postmortem was performed. Its findings haven’t yet been published, but as far as is known, only one bullet hit him, in the head.

The IDF lost no time in issuing an announcement stating that there had been a car-ramming attempt and that the vehicle had driven fast toward the soldiers and had endangered their lives.

This week we asked the army’s spokesperson’s office a number of questions: Does the IDF still maintain that there was a car-ramming attack? Have the soldiers involved been interrogated yet by the Military Police? And if they thought it was a car-ramming, why didn’t the troops rush after the vehicle in order to arrest the perpetrators? To all these questions the answer was: “In the wake of the event, a Military Police investigation was launched, and at its conclusion the findings will be forwarded to the office of the military advocate general.”

Salam Abu Eid, the head of the Biddu council, told Haaretz this week: “It was a crime not only against Osama but also against his wife and five children. The soldiers killed seven people, not only one person.”

Daisies planted by Osama adorn the yard of the house. His daughter Baylasan, 13, is sitting, dresed in black, her gaze bleak, along with the older brother, 15-year-old Mohammed. Baylasan (“elderberry” in Arabic) is a plant with white flowers from which myrrh and incense are extracted. One family member relates that today the plant can be found only across the barrier, on lands seized by Israel.

Ten-year-old Nisan rests her head on her mother’s lap, just as her father did in his last moments. Nisan covers her face with her cellphone, as though to distance herself from having to hear, over and over, what happened to her parents that night on which she lost her father – most likely for doing nothing wrong.",1784,10213,16,92

It was the fourth consecutive day that the country recorded over 2 lakh cases.

India has recorded 1,47,88,109 active cases since the beginning of the outbreak last year, while active cases stand at 18,01,316. The death toll from the viral infection is 177,150, and the total recoveries are 1,28,09643.

With cases spiralling across India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will chair a meeting to review the Covid-19 situation in his Lok Sabha constituency of Varanasi.

The meeting will be attended by top officials, local administration and doctors who are involved in fighting the outbreak in Varanasi.

Separately, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will address a digital press conference on Sunday noon.

On Saturday, India recorded single-day rise of 2,34,692 cases and 1,341 fatalities.

India’s Covid-19 tally had crossed the 20-lakh mark on August 7 last year, the 30-lakh mark on August 23, the 40-lakh mark on September 5 and the 50-lakh mark on September 16

It went past 60 lakh on September 28, 70 lakh on October 11, 80 lakh on October 29, 90 lakh on November 20 and the one-crore mark on December 19.

The health ministry stressed that more than 70 per cent of the deaths occurred due to co-morbidities. “Our figures are being reconciled with the Indian Council of Medical Research,” the ministry said on its website, adding that state-wise distribution of figures is subject to further verification and reconciliation.

The 1,501 new fatalities include 419 from Maharashtra, 167 from Delhi, 158 from Chhattisgarh, 120 from Uttar Pradesh, 97 from Gujarat, 80 from Karnataka, 66 from Madhya Pradesh, 62 from Punjab and 39 from Tamil Nadu.

The court sided with the federal government Thursday in overturning a lower court decision that had called into question the future of the Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA), amid arguments that the United States cannot be considered a safe country for asylum seekers.

The decision will have devastating effects on would-be refugee claimants, their advocates say.

“The real consequences of this decision rest with those refugee claimants who are being returned to U.S. detention facilities after being turned back and facing harm both in jail and in the U.S. asylum process,” said Amanda Aziz of the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers.

“What is lost in this decision are the people who will continue to face real and severe harm because of the ongoing operation of the STCA.”

Under the bilateral pact, Canada and the U.S. each recognize the other country as a safe place to seek protection.

That means Canada can turn back potential refugees who arrive at land ports of entry along the Canada-U. S. border on the basis they should pursue their claims in the States, the country where they first arrived.

The agreement, which took effect in 2004, was originally touted by officials in both countries as a way to curb “asylum shopping.” However, critics have long argued that the U.S. asylum system is cruel and inhumane — critiques that grew louder during the Trump administration.

In July, the Federal Court found it unconstitutional to ban would-be claimants from attempting to enter either country at official border crossings, saying the impacts of the policy “shock the conscience.”

Justice Ann Marie McDonald had given Ottawa six months to respond and fix the policy to make sure it complies with the Canadian charter before declaring the accord invalid. That deadline was later extended at the request of the government while the appeal was being heard.

However, in its decision released Thursday, Canada’s appeal court said lawyers for asylum seekers and their supporters focused on the wrong issues in challenging the law’s constitutionality.

It said there are proper checks and balances in the legislative scheme to ensure Canadian laws and the charter are upheld, and it’s within the government’s authority to make regulations designating a country as safe for refugees.

Instead of using individual refugees’ experiences to show the bilateral pact itself violated their Charter rights, said the appeal court, lawyers for the litigants should have made a case of how existing administrative oversight has failed to safeguard their rights.

“The legislative scheme as a whole, assuming it is operated properly, is designed to protect fundamental human rights, including charter rights,” wrote Justice David Stratas in a unanimous decision on behalf of the three-member panel.

“Based on the record before us, to the extent that detrimental effects are being suffered by persons being returned to the United States, the legislative scheme as a whole is not to blame.”

The federal government welcomed the decision.

“Canada remains firmly committed to upholding a fair and compassionate refugee protection system and the STCA remains a comprehensive means for the compassionate, fair, and orderly handling of asylum claims at the Canada-U.S. land border,” said Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino and Public Safety Minister Bill Blair in a joint statement.

In its ruling, the appeal court said Parliament created a mechanism to monitor the designated country’s compliance on an ongoing basis.

Although the law doesn’t specify what continuing review means, who should conduct it and what should be examined in a review, a policy was developed for the assessment based on a wide variety of governmental and non-governmental sources.

The court said immigration officers also have a number of powers and discretions to make exemptions to accept claims by individuals who would otherwise be ineligible to cross into Canada and seek asylum under the Safe Third Country Agreement.

As well, refugee claimants have access to the Federal Court if they believe the circumstances of their removal warrant the court’s intervention.

“In this case, there was no evidence that could support a finding that the treatment of returnees to the United States at the Canada-United States border ‘shocks the conscience,’” said the appeal court.

“There is evidence of individual cases of substandard treatment but nothing that rises to the very high level required by the ‘shocks the conscience’ standard.”

In 2007, three advocacy groups — the Canadian Council for Refugees, Amnesty International and the Canadian Council of Churches — took Ottawa to federal court and successfully had the U.S. declared unsafe for refugees.

However, the decision was later overturned on appeal, largely on the grounds that the groups failed to find a lead individual litigant who was directly impacted by the policy.

In 2017, those groups returned to the court with a group of asylum seekers whose access to Canadian asylum was denied under the Safe Third Country Agreement to support their arguments.

This appeal court said some of the evidence, although voluminous, is piecemeal and individualized and, thus, is problematic for drawing system-wide inferences concerning the situation in the U.S.

“The value of evidence is not measured by the pound,” Justice Stratas wrote. “The evidence of the particular treatment of ten individuals — all selected by the claimants — cannot itself provide a basis for making system-wide inferences.”

Citing a previous court case that found psychological suffering inherent in the plight of refugees fleeing persecution, Stratas wrote: “One must ask whether sending refugee claimants back to the United States actually increased psychological suffering above this inherent level.”

Janet Dench of the Canadian Council for Refugees said the court’s findings were disappointing.

“The court heard the evidence of the very horrific experiences of people who were sent back to the U.S. The conditions in detention were found to be completely unacceptable by the federal court judge. Those experiences were not engaged by this court,” said Dench.

“Those experiences, the rights abuses and their suffering don’t seem to be heard in this (appeal) court.”",1031,6577,15,92

Cyber intrusions, interference in democratic processes and the build-up of military forces near the Ukrainian border and in illegally annexed Crimea were among the reasons the Foreign Office said it had summoned Andrei Kelin.

On Thursday, Joe Biden said he was imposing sanctions on Russia for interference in the 2020 presidential election and a cyberattack on the American government and corporate networks.

Image: Russian Ambassador Andrei Kelin was summoned to the Foreign Office on Thursday

The US formally named Russia's foreign intelligence service as the perpetrator of the SolarWinds cyberattack last year in which more than 40 US government organisations, including federal agencies, and those with government contracts were hacked.

Some of the victims were outside the US, including in the UK, Belgium, Canada, Israel, Mexico, Spain and the UAE.

Today, Sir Philip Barton, permanent under-secretary at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), ""made clear"" to Mr Kelin the UK supports those sanctions, a spokesman said.

""The UK government is deeply concerned about a pattern of malign behaviour by the Russian state,"" he added.

Sir Philip told the Russian ambassador the UK has also assessed the Russian Intelligence Services ""were behind the SolarWinds compromise"".

The FCDO said the impact in the UK had been assessed by the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) - part of GCHQ - as ""low"" with a ""low single-digit number"" of public sector bodies having been targeted.

It said the government had been working with the affected organisations to ensure they were ""rapidly mitigated"".

Sir Philip also told Mr Kelin the UK will ""continue to work with our allies to call out and counter malign operations by the Russian Intelligence Services"".

""Sir Philip also stated the UK's concern at the build-up of Russian military forces near the Ukrainian border and illegally-annexed Crimea,"" the FCDO spokesman said.

""These activities are threatening and destabilising. Russia needs to cease its provocations and de-escalate tensions in line with its international obligations.""

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK and US were determined to stand together against Russia's ""malign behaviour"".

""We see what Russia is doing to undermine our democracies,"" he said.

Ten Russian embassy staff are being expelled by the US as part of the executive order, including Russian intelligence members.

Thirty-two entities and individuals were also sanctioned for ""carrying out Russian government-directed attempts to influence the 2020 US presidential elections, and other acts of disinformation and interference"", the US Treasury said.

Mr Biden's administration said it is also ""responding to reports that Russia encouraged Taliban attacks against US and coalition personnel in Afghanistan"".

An official said US intelligence agencies had ""low to moderate confidence"" in reports Russia offered to pay bounties for dead American troops.

Russia's foreign ministry summoned US ambassador John Sullivan to its Moscow offices less than an hour after the sanctions were announced.

Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign ministry's spokeswoman, said Russia would give ""a decisive rebuff"" to the ""aggressive behaviour"" by the US.",557,3699,16,92
0,Indian double mutation variant arrives in Britain and has 'hallmarks of very dangerous virus',https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-indian-double-mutation-variant-arrives-in-britain-and-has-hallmarks-of-very-dangerous-virus-12276922,"The new Indian variant of the COVID virus that's been detected in the UK has all the hallmarks of a very dangerous virus.

It has two new significant mutations in the spike protein that help it infect cells and evade the immune system.

New figures from Public Health England (PHE) show there have been 73 cases detected in England and another four in Scotland.

The variant - officially named B.1.617 - is almost certainly playing a part in the very sharp spike in the epidemic in India.

It has been detected in at least five Indian states that are hotspots for the surge, with more than 200,000 new cases of COVID detected nationwide on Wednesday.

One of the concerning mutations, called L452R, is also found in a variant circulating in California, though there is no link between the viruses. The Indian variant has evolved independently.

The other mutation in the virus is completely new. It is at the same '484' position in the spike protein that is also mutated in the South African variant, and some others. But the actual mutation - E484Q - is slightly different.

Lab tests show both mutations help the virus to infect human cells and evade some antibodies.

Image: Millions of devotees continued to take part in Kumbh Mela, in India, this week despite the pandemic.

The combination - called a double mutant - is a particular concern.

As yet it is unknown what impact they would have on the effectiveness of the existing vaccines.

The discovery of so many cases of the Indian variant in the UK highlights the flaw in relying on a traffic light system for controlling international spread of potentially dangerous viruses.

India is not on the red list so there is no requirement for hotel quarantine. Instead returning travellers are required to take two COVID tests and quarantine at home for 10 days.

But if people don't fully quarantine there is a risk of the virus escaping.

Research shows the South African variant was brought into the country several times before travellers from some African countries were told they had to quarantine in a hotel.

And latest PHE figures show there have been 56 more cases of the South African variant detected in the UK in the last week as the virus continues to spread, with the total now 600.

0,White House warns Russia will face consequences if Putin critic Alexei Navalny dies in prison,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/18/white-house-warns-russia-will-face-consequences-if-alexei-navalny-dies.html,"Russian opposition activist Alexei Navalny makes a heart gesture during a hearing into an application by the Russian Federal Penitentiary Service to convert his suspended sentence of three and a half years in the Yves Rocher case into a real jail term.

WASHINGTON – White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Sunday that the Biden administration warned the Russian government to not let jailed Putin critic Alexei Navalny die in custody.

""We have communicated to the Russian government that what happens to Mr. Navalny in their custody is their responsibility and they will be held accountable by the international community,"" Sullivan said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" program.

""We have communicated that there will be consequences if Mr. Navalny dies,"" he added.

Navalny flew to Russia from Berlin earlier this year after spending nearly half a year recovering for a nerve agent poisoning that took place last August. He was arrested at passport control and later sentenced to more than two years in prison.

Last month, the United States sanctioned seven members of the Russian government for the alleged poisoning and subsequent detention of Navalny. The sanctions were the first to target Moscow under Biden's leadership. The Trump administration did not take action against Russia over the Navalny situation.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken wrote in a separate statement that the sanctions would ""send a clear signal"" to Russia that the use of chemical weapons and human rights abuses carry hefty consequences.

""Any use of chemical weapons is unacceptable and contravenes international norms,"" Blinken wrote.

The Kremlin has repeatedly denied having a role in Navalny's poisoning.

A spokesman for Navalny said that the Russian opposition leader's health has deteriorated since his imprisonment. Navalny began a hunger strike in order to force his jailers to provide access to outside medical care for pain in his back and legs. A lawyer for Navalny said he is suffering from two spinal hernias, AP reported.

Russian authorities have previously said that they have offered Navalny proper medical care but that he continues to refuse it. The prison has declined to allow a doctor of Navalny's choice from outside of the facility to administer his treatment.

On Saturday, physician Yaroslav Ashikhmin said that test results he received from Navalny's family show that the jailed critic has elevated levels of potassium, which can trigger a cardiac arrest. Navalny also has heightened creatinine levels that indicate potential kidney failure.

""Our patient could die at any moment,"" Ashikhmin said in a Facebook post.

In an interview with the BBC on Sunday, the Russian ambassador to the U.K. accused Navalny of dramatizing his condition in order to attract attention.

""Of course he will not be allowed to die in prison, but I can say that Mr. Navalny, he behaves like a hooligan, absolutely,"" Andrei Kelin said. ""His purpose for all of that is to attract attention for him, also by saying that today his left hand is sick and tomorrow his leg is sick and all of that stuff so the journalists pay attention.""

""Navalny has been treated in the hospital which lies not so far from the place where he is serving his sentence and as I understand, he does not complain anymore,"" Kelin added.

Last week, the Biden administration slapped Russia with a slew of U.S. sanctions for human rights abuses, sweeping cyberattacks and attempts to influence U.S. elections.

In an address Thursday, Biden said he was prepared to take further actions against Moscow.

""If Russia continues to interfere with our democracy, I'm prepared to take further actions to respond. It is my responsibility as president of the United States to do so,"" Biden said from the White House.

""I was clear with President Putin that we could have gone further, but I chose not to do so, I chose to be proportionate,"" Biden said of the measures, adding that he did not want to ""kick off a cycle of escalation and conflict with Russia.""

Biden also said that he proposed in a phone call with Putin that the two meet in person this summer in Europe to discuss a range of pressing issues.

Sullivan told CNN that the Biden-Putin summit was something that was being discussed but would not provide any additional details.

""There isn't currently a summit on the books, it's something that we are talking about. That summit would have to take place of course in the right circumstances in a way that could actually move the relationship forward,' Sullivan said.",773,4719,15,93
0,What happens to the children of the pregnant women behind bars in the Philippines’ drugs war?,https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/southeast-asia/philippines-drugs-war-pregnant-women-b1830184.html,"R

osemarie Santiago was four months pregnant when she walked into prison. She left more than a year later as a mother who had spent just one day with her child.

She was taken to a Manila hospital to give birth to her son Jericho. The next day her siblings claimed him, and she returned to prison. She would not see him for another nine months.

“When I came back, he was so thin,” says Santiago, who was arrested in 2018 on drugs charges. “I kept thinking about what could have happened if I had not been arrested.”

Santiago is among hundreds of young mothers who give birth while in government custody in the Philippines, where the poor can wait up to a decade for a trial. Some women tend to their children in dismal conditions, even while handcuffed to their hospital beds. Others, like Santiago, surrender the child to family.

The most prominent recent case is that of activist Reina Mae Nasino, whose baby River died of pneumonia in October. The spectacle of the funeral, with a 23-year-old mother cuffed and unable to wipe her tears, was seen by critics of president Rodrigo Duterte as a jarring portrait of diminishing rights in the country. Duterte's expanding crackdown on drugs has sharply increased prison populations and left an estimated 25,000 people dead – drawing criticism from rights activists around the world. Nasino is charged with the possession of illegal weapons, which she denies.

The national Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) recorded more than 1,600 pregnant detainees and 485 births in the past two years. Around 80 per cent of the women face cases related to drugs, says medical officer Dr Paul Borlongan.

Drug-related charges against women jumped to more than 15,000 from 9,000 in 2015. Many are arrested alongside their partners and families, according to the Philippines’ Commission on Human Rights.

At least one other death of a detained activist's child was reported this year. Human rights advocates argue that babies have a higher chance of survival if they are not separated from their mothers. The World Health Organisation recommends breastfeeding for at least six months.

Rules in the jail management bureau manual cap a mother and baby’s time together at one month. Anything more must be approved by a court

But rules in the jail management bureau manual cap a mother and baby's time together at one month. Anything more must be approved by a court. Many facilities enforce separation after only a day, citing health concerns for the child.

The treatment of incarcerated mothers is largely “prison-specific, judge-specific, warden-specific”, says Inez Feria, director of NoBox Philippines, an organisation advocating drug policy reform. NoBox has supported calls to release mothers and other vulnerable people in order to decongest prisons.

At the Correctional Institution for Women, mothers can spend up to a year with their children. As the only national prison for women, it can set different rules from the one-month limit for newborns that applies in most other detention facilities.

When The Washington Post visited in February, three young women and their babies shared a space called the “mothers' ward”, across the hall from the cramped dorms of fellow inmates. The room had five beds (two mothers had recently checked out), a shared bathroom, a pantry and a shelf of toys.

Superintendent Virginia Mangawit says a separate facility would still be ideal. They are always in need of bed space. The prison, built for 1,500 inmates, holds more than 3,000.

Santiago, the former detainee, says she was not involved in drugs but pleaded guilty on the advice of authorities in order to avoid a longer wait for trial. By the time she walked free in 2019, Jericho's father had left.

BJMP spokesperson Xavier Solda defends the one-month cap for new mothers to be with their babies. “[It] is in the best interest of the child given the atmosphere, the health risks, on the part of the baby,” he says. “Are [critics] really saying that it's more okay to stay in a jail, given the conditions in our jails, rather than at home with a family?”

But human rights advocates say the Philippines is in violation of the “Bangkok rules”, guidelines from the United Nations on the treatment of women in detention. Under these requirements, determining the length of a mother and child's time together must be “made in the best interests of the child”.

The rules also say that cuffing mothers, even during the transfer to a hospital, “[violates] international standards”, and that every effort should be made to give pregnant women noncustodial sentences, among other recommendations on the facilities and health services that should be available.

In the Philippines, the Commission on Human Rights reports inconsistency in access to maternal health services. “None of the women mentioned availability of postnatal care or services for those experiencing postpartum depression,” it says. Only 37 out of 84 women's dormitories have a breastfeeding room.

Raymund Narag, prison reform advocate and assistant professor at Southern Illinois University, says the lack of physical and legal structures forces bureau employees in the Philippines to come up with individual solutions. Prison officers sometimes convert their offices to nursing spaces, or pool donations with the help of other detainees. At the national penitentiary, a prison employee adopted an inmate's child.

“Sometimes those coping mechanisms benefit [some] people but don't benefit others,” says Narag, a former detainee himself, who spent seven years in prison on murder charges of which he was eventually cleared. “You need new guidelines to deal with the concrete situation, not idealistic ones.”

Experts suggest that these gaps should be addressed through a new law, alongside formal guidelines from the country's Supreme Court and revisions to the jail management manual.

Officials told The Post that an interagency memorandum, which would streamline rules and probably extend the time allotted for mother and child, is under review. The health department hopes it will pass within the year. A Philippines senate bill, meant to aid incarcerated parents, has been pending at committee level since last year.

The issue can be personal for bureau employees. Hannah Nario-Lopez, a University of the Philippines assistant professor who conducts research and skills training in prisons, says some female guards expressed frustration at online vitriol received after the Nasino case.

“At the end of the day, all women suffer here,” she says. “[Anger at the] cruelty of the state, I think, should [be] directed to the critique of the system, lack of institutional support . . . rather than personal attacks on the officers.”

In one case last May, prison guard Sallie Tinapay – who was nursing her own 8-month-old at the time – was assigned to watch over a detainee after childbirth. When the inmate could not produce milk, she fed the baby from her own breast.

“It was like she didn't want to breastfeed,” Tinapay recalls. “She was thinking that they would be separated anyway.”

The mother, whom authorities did not identify for the sake of privacy, could not secure a court permit that would prolong her hospital stay. Social services picked up the infant, and a relative claimed her later, Tinapay says.

The inmate has been released, according to the prison’s management.

“I hoped she would be set free,” Tinapay says, “so she can take good care of her child.”

The Pentagon also confirmed that further stills, showing objects of various shapes, are real.

The Department of Defense's Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force is studying them.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

The Department of Defense has confirmed that images and video of triangle-shaped unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) are real and were taken by Navy personnel.

UAP is the official term for what is more commonly known as an unidentified flying object, or UFO.

The Pentagon confirmation was first reported by CNN.

The leaked images and video were published on ExtraordinaryBeliefs.com — a website run by the artist and filmmaker Jeremy Corbell — and MysteryWire.com, but they have been shared online over the last year, CNN reported.

Corbell also tweeted the footage, which can be seen here:

The video shows a glinting triangular object moving about the sky, viewed through what appears to be a circular green lens.

The Pentagon spokesperson Sue Gough said in a statement shared with Insider that three other still images that have been circulating are also genuine.

""The photographs and videos – what the Mystery Wire article refers to as 'Sphere,' 'Acorn,' and 'Metallic Blimp,' and the videos in the Extraordinary Beliefs article — were taken by Navy personnel,"" Gough said.

She declined to provide further details, citing national security. The video and images have not been officially released.

""To maintain operations security and to avoid disclosing information that may be useful to potential adversaries, DOD does not discuss publicly the details of either the observations or the examinations of reported incursions into our training ranges or designated airspace, including those incursions initially designated as UAP,"" Gough added.

The images and video are being examined by the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force, she said. The task force was set up in August last year to ""detect, analyze and catalog UAPs that could potentially pose a threat to US national security.""

UFOs returned to considerable national attention in April last year, when the Pentagon released three videos and confirmed that they had been taken by Navy personnel.

The footage, titled FLIR, GOFAST and GIMBAL, date from between 2004 and 2015. They show black shapes moving about the sky, against the wind currents, and their audio records the astonished reaction of the pilots who took the footage.",395,2503,18,93

Lucknow: On Sunday, 11 April, Uttar Pradesh recorded its highest single-day spike since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic last year — registering 15,353 cases — and capital Lucknow was shown to have contributed around 27 per cent of them.

On 13 April, it emerged that the total number of Covid cases in Lucknow had gone up to 27,385 from 3,912 on 1 April — a jump of nearly 670 per cent — while the active case number for UP climbed to 95,980.

The state health department’s bulletin Monday showed that 72 Covid patients had died in UP in the preceding 24 hours (most of Sunday), of which 21 deaths were in Lucknow. The corresponding figures in Tuesday’s bulletin for the preceding 24 hours were 85 for the state and 18 for the city. However, Ajay Dwivedi, Lucknow’s municipal commissioner, told ThePrint that 69 bodies came to Lucknow’s crematoriums Sunday, leading to a long queue due to the shortage of staff.

Dwivedi said that while some staff are away at the Kumbh Mela, others have been “scared” to handle these bodies because of the bounce in infections.

“We were handling 7-8 cremations of Covid patients’ bodies on average per day (combined for the two crematoriums). But in the last one week, the number went up to 30 and then 40. Eventually, 69 bodies came for cremation Sunday. We were not prepared for this massive surge as some of our staff has gone to the Kumbh Mela. This is the reason that there was a long queue on the weekend at the cremation grounds,” he said.

‘Things being brought under control’

The rise of Covid deaths in Lucknow was underlined in a video that went viral Sunday, in which Lucknow DM Abhishek Prakash is seen talking to the doctors in a city hospital. “Increase ICUs, put people in isolation, do whatever is possible as you people are experts… Because now, people are dying on the roads,” he said in Hindi.

But Dwivedi assured that the administration had things under control now. “We have now employed 100 people who work in two shifts, day and night. We had already prepared 50 funeral pyres; the staff prepares them at night so there is no queue the next day. There have been no queues waiting Monday,” he claimed.

The commissioner added that wood for the pyres is being brought in on 10 trucks from the Sitapur Road, about 12 km outside the city, every day. “Looking at the numbers, we are preparing five electric crematoriums in the next 10 days, each of which can handle 8-10 bodies a day,” he added.

Yet, when ThePrint visited the two cremation grounds, Gulala Shamshan Ghat and Baikunth Dham, Monday afternoon, contrary to the commissioner’s claims, dozens of families were found waiting in the rising heat to perform the last rites of their loved ones. Almost every hour, a new body arrived for cremation.

Ajay Kumar, 33, whose uncle succumbed to the virus, was waiting, clueless, for his family’s turn. “My mausa ji (maternal aunt’s husband) was sick for a week. He complained of fever and cough, and died within one day of hospitalisation,” he said.

As families said their goodbyes to their loved ones, ghat employees continued to prepare new pyres. An employee at Gulala cremation ground said: “I have never seen a situation like this. I have seen more dead bodies in one week than my whole life.”

People reaching hospital in critical condition

The health machinery in the state capital is in a state of chaos, ThePrint’s visit to the King George’s Medical University, the main Covid facility, showed. A healthcare worker at KGMU said: “The last week has been horrible. People are coming in a critical condition and many of them aren’t surviving.”

Dr D.S. Negi, director-general of UP’s health department, told ThePrint: “This spike can be attributed to Holi when people came from all over the country to their hometowns. The general public’s attitude towards the virus has become too casual.”

Dr M.N. Siddiqi of Integral Medical College concurred. “People have started taking this virus lightly. Even if you go to the market, 50 per cent of the people don’t wear a mask. Healthcare workers are now getting infected in bulk. The second wave is more lethal as the jump in critical patients has gone up to 50 per cent.”

Most of the government and private hospitals in the city are full. But now many of these hospitals are turning their isolation wards into ICUs to accommodate critical patients, as people from neighbouring districts are also coming to Lucknow.

Yogi govt’s decisions

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath reviewed the Covid situation in the state and its capital Sunday, where he ordered the closure of all government and private schools till 30 April. The state government has also shut private coaching centres.

The CM directed that Era Medical College, T.S. Mishra Medical College and Integral Medical College should be transformed into Covid hospitals in the next three days. He told the officials to add 2,000 ICU beds in Lucknow in the next day, and add another 2,000 in the next seven days.

All districts of UP have been put under a strict night curfew, beginning at 9 pm. Only people with special passes are allowed to move after that hour.

0,‘Not what we’d hoped for’: UK military chief disappointed over US withdrawal from Afghanistan,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/afghanistan-military-troops-withdrawal-defence-b1832722.html,"Britain’s military chief has expressed disappointment at president Joe Biden’s decision to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan.

General Sir Nick Carter, the Chief of the Defence Staff, said it was “not a decision we hoped for” but added that the UK respected the stance taken by the new administration.

His comments come after Mr Biden announced this week that the 2,500 remaining troops would leave Afghanistan by 11 September, the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on the US.

This marked an extension of the 1 May deadline set by his predecessor, Donald Trump.

Mr Biden said: “It’s time to end America’s longest war. It’s time for American troops to come home.”

Nato allies including the UK confirmed they would also withdraw their armed forces. Britain is to begin pulling out its remaining 750 military trainers from next month.

Gen Carter acknowledged the final withdrawal of international forces after two decades could lead to a return of the warlords but said the situation may not be “quite as bad” as some were predicting.

He told BBC Radio 4’s Today: “It is not a decision that we hoped for but we obviously respect it. It is clearly an acknowledgement of an evolving US strategic posture.”

He said he felt a “great deal of pride” at what the British armed forces had achieved during their time in the country.

“We went into Afghanistan back in 2001 to prevent international terrorism ever emerging from Afghanistan,” he said.

“In the last 20 years there has been no international terrorist attack mounted from Afghanistan. I think that is a great tribute to our armed forces and of course to the armed forces of the Nato countries that have been committed to this.”

Gen Carter said Afghanistan had “evolved hugely” over the past 20 years, while the Taliban had also changed during that time.

The Taliban refers to itself as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. While it stopped attacking international forces as part of national peace talks, it has continued to fight the Afghan government.

The BBC reported that last month, the Taliban threatened to resume attacking foreign troops that remained in the country on 1 May. The group’s “shadow mayor” in the Balkh district, Haji Hekmat, told the broadcaster: “We have won the war and America has lost.”

Some individuals involved in peace talks with the Taliban said Mr Biden’s decision to pull troops out has jeopardised Washington’s efforts and increased the chances of an upsurge in violence.

Ashley Jackson, from the Overseas Development Institute, said: “Biden’s announcement decreases any leverage the international community has left over them, and helps the Taliban justify refusing to attend.”

But Gen Carter believes the Taliban “is not the organisation it once was”.

“It is an organisation that has evolved in the 20 years that we have been there and I think they recognise that they need some political legitimacy,” he said.

“I would not be surprised if a scenario plays out that actually sees it not being quite as bad as perhaps some of the naysayers at the moment are predicting.

“The Afghan armed forces are indeed much better trained than one might imagine. I think they could easily hold together and all of this could work out. We will just have to see.

“At the end of the day, the Afghan people are looking for stability, they are looking for peace, and that is not lost on the Taliban.”

Article content The federal government is considering a controversial move to allow internet service providers to block websites that show pirated movies and TV shows. The government launched a consultation document Wednesday that proposes a number of options to crack down on online content that infringes copyright in Canada. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Try refreshing your browser, or Canada is considering a proposal that would allow internet providers to block piracy websites Back to video “This is something you can safely say is going to receive a lot of pushback,” said Laura Tribe, executive director of internet advocacy group OpenMedia. According to a 2018 government report, pirated content is accessed by 26 per cent of online Canadians. And when a website-blocking proposal was unsuccessfully floated three years ago thousands of Canadians complained to the CRTC that it was an attack on net neutrality and free expression. The goal of the consultation is to ensure that those who hold the rights to the content “are able to obtain fair remuneration for protected uses of their content online,” the paper outlined. Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault said in a press release the Canada needs “a more up-to-date framework to ensure more accountability and better remuneration and transparency.”

Article content Innovation Minister Philippe-François Champagne said in the release the consultation aims to “strike the balance between facilitating broad, lawful access to copyright-protected content, and safeguarding individual rights and freedoms in an open Internet.” The government launched the consultation “to hear the diverse perspectives of stakeholders, from online intermediaries to those holding copyrights, as well as any Canadian who wants to share input,” he said. More On This Topic Massive Facebook data breach affecting millions of Canadians was not reported to federal privacy watchdog Promises to reduce wireless bills could haunt Liberals if Rogers-Shaw merger becomes campaign issue Options the government is considering include requiring intermediaries, a category that includes internet service providers and online platforms, to block access to infringing content, or limit, suspend or terminate access to their services for infringers. It suggested both implementing a court process that would oversee such actions, and “notification and action mechanisms” in which decisions would be “made according to the intermediary’s judgment rather than required” by legislation.

Article content “This is internet policy being pushed by broadcast interests,” and a conflict of interest that will lead to overreach, Tribe said. That’s because some of Canada’s biggest internet providers are vertically integrated companies whose media divisions are rightsholders to content. “If you look at a company like Bell, they are predisposed to believe something is a violation of copyright if it is their copyright they think is being violated,” she said. She added that the fundamental principle of net neutrality “is that these are supposed to be common carriers. They’re supposed to carry all content equally until it is proven to be illegal.” Having companies decide what is good and bad, “is very different, particularly when they have such conflicted business interests,” Tribe said. A website-blocking proposal was put forward three years ago when a coalition of broadcasters and groups representing the production sector asked the CRTC to implement a regime that would block access to infringing content. The “FairPlay” coalition included the media divisions of vertically integrated companies that are also ISPs and TV service providers, including Bell, Rogers and Quebecor. It estimated the cost of piracy to TV providers amounted to $500 million a year, lowering their contributions to production of Canadian content by between $11 million and $25 million annually.

Article content The application drew strong opposition from internet advocates and many Canadians, about 141,000 of whom signed petitions against the proposal, which the CRTC ultimately concluded wasn’t in its jurisdiction. Photo by Brent Lewin/Bloomberg The consultation document released by the government Wednesday suggested implementing a court process that could result in orders to block websites or remove them from search engine results, orders to remove content and orders to “limit, suspend or terminate access” to service. The court would be available “in at least certain cases” without first having to obtain a judgment from the court against those infringing content and without having to include them as a party in the court proceeding. In 2019, Federal Court ordered ISPs to block a copyright infringing site, GoldTV, for the first time. That decision is currently in appeal. The consultation document also outlines ways legislation could put more responsibility on intermediaries to be aware of and fight such content. Intermediates are currently subject to “safe harbour” protections from liability in cases where they “merely provide the technical means by which others infringe copyright.”

Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Article content The consultation paper proposed changes to those protections, by “compelling greater vigilance of intermediaries against potential infringements facilitated by their services.” It also suggested imposing additional obligations on intermediaries “either as conditions on their safe harbour protections or standalone measures.” Those obligations could include requirements to take down content or cut off the infringer’s access to the intermediary’s service, it suggested, with intermediaries making the call whether to take such actions. Such mechanisms would have to be documented, and “easily accessible and understandable,” it said. Carleton University professor Dwayne Winseck said in an interview that putting obligations on ISPs to prevent or stop infringement is “fraught with difficulties” because it leaves them as the “judge, jury and executioner.” He added that the involvement of vertically integrated companies “in which one division of the shop would be reporting a possible infringing site to another division with the same shop, recommending that it be blocked, is hugely problematic.”

Article content Another option suggested by the paper is a new compulsory licensing scheme in which intermediaries like social media platforms would pay royalties to rightsholders, which would apply to large, for-profit online platforms that host user-uploaded content. University of Ottawa law professor Michael Geist said in an email that the “proposal to effectively tax online content through yet more collective licensing is misguided.” He said calling for government-backed licensing systems “might be good for lawyers, but will harm innovation, provide little to creators, and ultimately reduce choice for the public.”

Bill 205, sponsored by MLA Peter Singh of the United Conservative Party of Alberta, was passed after its third reading on March 22, 2021 and received Royal Assent on March 26, 2021.

The bill, titled “Genocide Remembrance, Condemnation and Prevention Month Act” encourages the government to develop strategies to prevent and combat the causes of genocide, recognize the impact of genocides on individuals from various ethnic and religious communities in Alberta, remember the victims and raise awareness on genocides that have occurred across the world.

The bill specifically highlights the Armenian Genocide; the Ukrainian Holodomor; the Jewish Holocaust; the Genocide Against the Tutsi in Rwanda; the Srebrenica Massacre; the Yazidi Genocide and the Rohingya Genocide.

Furthermore, the bill prescribes that “Within one year of the coming into force of this Act, the Minister must complete a report setting out the strategies and proposed actions that the Government commits to undertake to effect the purposes of this Act.”

With the passage of Bill 205, Alberta becomes the second province in Canada – after Quebec – to pass a bill into law, recognizing the Armenian Genocide.

The Canadian Senate recognized the Armenian Genocide in 2002, followed by the House of Commons in 2004 and the Government of Canada in 2006. On April 24, 2015, on the centenary of the Armenian Genocide, the House of Commons unanimously passed Motion-587, declaring the month of April as Genocide Remembrance, Condemnation and Prevention Month in Canada.

The Armenian National Committee of Canada is extremely pleased with the passage of Bill 205 and expresses its utmost gratitude to the Premier of Alberta, the Hon. Jason Kenney, MLA Peter Singh and all members of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta for their principled stance and their unwavering commitment to truth and justice.",325,2103,12,93
0,Japanese Prime Minister Challenged to Drink Radioactive Water Before Dumping It Into the Ocean,https://futurism.com/the-byte/japanese-prime-minister-challenged-drink-radioactive-water-dumping-ocean,"""So then please drink it.""

Shots Shots Shots

Last week, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga announced that the government could no longer delay its plan to dump radioactive water from the destroyed Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the ocean.

The Japanese government has repeatedly insisted that the plan won’t put biodiversity or people in the area at risk, but plenty of residents of Japan and neighboring countries are reasonably concerned about the dump. Now, the Chinese government is demanding dramatic proof that the water is safe, Japanese newspaper The Mainichi reports.

“A Japanese official said it is okay if we drink this water, so then please drink it,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told reporters on Wednesday, according to the paper.

Big Talk

Japan is already capable of purifying Fukushima’s contaminated water to a certain extent, but it can’t scrub out the radioactive tritium. The plan, however, is to dilute the water down so it contains just 2.5 percent of the tritium concentration permitted by its national standards before dumping it over the course of decades. But still, drinking it straight from the source sounds a bit dicey.

Lijian has since doubled down on the challenge.

“Japanese politicians said treated [waste water] is ‘innocent’, why don’t they drink, cook and wash clothes with the water first?” he tweeted on Thursday. “They should guarantee sea food won’t be contaminated; accept the advice of [The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)] and set up a technical working group with China and [Korea] to make assessment.”

However, it’s worth noting that the IAEA came out in support of Japan’s plan before Lijian issued his challenge.

“The Japanese Government’s decision is in line with practice globally,” IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano said in a press release, “even though the large amount of water at the Fukushima plant makes it a unique and complex case.”

0,Afghanistan withdrawal will likely dismantle a CIA intelligence network built up over 20 years,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/18/politics/afghanistan-withdrawal-cia-intelligence-network/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Joe Biden's planned withdrawal from Afghanistan includes an intense unraveling of the extensive intelligence and covert action network that the US has built there over the two decades since 9/11 as part of the global war on terror.

The current plan includes the removal of the hundreds of special operations forces not publicly acknowledged by the US government but known to be there, according to two defense officials and a senior US official with direct knowledge of the situation.

Most, if not all, CIA operators working in Afghanistan are almost certain to leave as well, current and former officials told CNN. Without the support of a conventional military presence, on-the-ground intelligence gathering becomes significantly more difficult -- and more dangerous.

Neither the removal of special operations forces nor the likely removal of intelligence operators has been previously reported.

A final decision has not yet been made as to the status of CIA paramilitary officers, one military official told CNN, but the thinking at the moment is that they likely will have to leave. Even if some personnel do remain after Biden's self-imposed September 11 withdrawal deadline, it will be far more challenging to pull off the kind of covert operations the CIA has become famous for since 9/11.

CIA Director Bill Burns admitted as much in a Senate Intelligence Committee public hearing last week

""When the time comes for the US military to withdraw, the US government's ability to collect and act on threats will diminish. That's simply a fact,"" Burns said before noting the CIA will retain ""a suite of capabilities, some of them remaining in place, some of them that we'll generate that can help us to anticipate and contest any rebuilding effort [by al Qaeda or ISIS].""

National security adviser Jake Sullivan acknowledged Sunday that US intelligence gathering capability in Afghanistan would be diminished when troops withdraw from Afghanistan, but said there would be enough capability to know whether al Qaeda is resurging months before it's too late.

""It is true as the CIA director said we won't have the same level of presence on the ground that we did when we had 3,000 troops or 30,000 troops or 100,000 troops,"" Sullivan told CNN's Dana Bash on ""State of the Union.""

""But the CIA director also said we will retain sufficient capability so that we will have months of warning before al Qaeda is able to gather again external plotting capability to threaten the homeland,"" he continued.

Asked whether special operation forces would stay behind, Sullivan said the US would ""not have a military presence in Afghanistan other than to protect the embassy.""

Douglas London, a 34-year veteran of the CIA, said intelligence operations in Afghanistan are dependent on the large military presence the US has kept in the country.

""The US intelligence presence and ability to collect information depends on the military's infrastructure across the country,"" said London.

""As the US presence diminishes, and with it collectors who need to physically acquire intelligence on the ground, so does our visibility,"" he added. ""That human intelligence comes from sources on the ground who can be regularly met. How many can travel to Kabul, let alone outside the country?""

The fate of the special operations forces — who often work with the CIA on counterterrorism missions — is more clear cut.

""It's unequivocal, all troops out,"" the senior US official told CNN, asked specifically about special operations forces.

Counterterrorism is about to get harder in Afghanistan

Intelligence gathered by operatives working on the ground is often critical to covert CIA missions, including drone strikes , multiple sources said.

""With the right information, [you] can launch an operation to kill someone a thousand miles away within two hours. But if you don't have any information, if you don't have any intelligence, how on earth can you predictably do that?"" a source with direct knowledge of internal discussions about the US counterterrorism mission in Afghanistan going forward.

It's unclear how or if the Biden administration will replace the intelligence and counterterrorism tools that senior officials publicly acknowledge they are giving up.

Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill have been clamoring for details, but two sources familiar with the administration's outreach to lawmakers in recent days tell CNN that officials have only gone as far as to say that the US will continue to fight terrorist groups there in the same way it does in other places around the world.

That response has been interpreted by some as continued drone strikes and, in some cases, use of special operations forces, according to one of those sources. The exact details of the plan remain unclear, leaving many lawmakers unsatisfied.

Administration officials are briefing the Senate on Tuesday, according to a Senate aide. House lawmakers expect a similar briefing next week also.

Regional options

Multiple sources told CNN that officials are still exploring ways to mitigate the inevitable intelligence void that comes from withdrawing American troops.

Specifically, US officials are examining the possibility of staging American forces in the region so they will be able to dip into Afghanistan for counterterrorism missions. But current and former officials say there is no way to do that as effectively as when you are in the country.

Maintaining any ""over the horizon"" counterterrorism capability will be very difficult without nearby basing, the US military official added, noting the withdrawal makes those missions ""a very different problem"" than in years past.

The current sense is that the nearby countries of Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan are unlikely to agree to host US forces, meaning the most likely possibilities are friendly Gulf countries, like the United Arab Emirates, where the US already maintains a military presence, according to multiple sources familiar with the planning.

Four F-35A Lightning IIs assigned to the 4th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron taxi after landing at Al Dhafra Air Base, United Arab Emirates, April 15, 2019.

Multiple current and former officials acknowledged that staging assets in a country like the UAE would require CIA paramilitary officers, special operations forces or drones to travel an extremely long distance for any operation in Afghanistan, adding to the risk and complexity of the mission.

""The prospects for direct kinetic counterterrorism pressure from the Gulf, they're not impossible, particularly for strike, but they're just not good,"" a source with direct knowledge of internal deliberations told CNN.

Any attempt by agency paramilitary or intelligence officers to operate outside of Kabul — whether to meet with sources or conduct a counterterrorism raid — would also be dramatically riskier, according to multiple sources.

A more dangerous mission

Because agency personnel won't be able to operate out of a local military base and will instead have to travel from Kabul, or even outside of Afghanistan, they would be forced to travel longer distances to more exposed places that might be in Taliban-controlled areas.

That not only gives potential targets the chance to hear of the impending raid and get away, it also provides adversaries the opportunity to launch a counterattack of their own, with agency personnel far outside of the so-called golden hour from the nearest hospital.

""You have a longer time to get there, so [adversaries] will tell people you're coming,"" said one former intelligence official. ""So even if you have the right place, the chances of the guy not being there go up. And then once you get there, you have to land if you want to catch people, and they're going to rally toward that area. When you fly out it's going to be like the OK Corral.""

""You increase the risk to the force and you increase the risk for the mission to fail,"" this person said.

Further complicating the picture is the risk that the Taliban could overrun the country once the US military leaves, potentially forcing the US to shutter its embassy to avoid another incident like the 2012 attack on the US embassy in Benghazi, which killed four Americans.

That would mean that any remaining agency personnel, who likely would be working out of the US embassy, would have to leave too — thrusting human-source intelligence gathering in Afghanistan back into a pre-9/11 darkness.

""A full US and NATO withdrawal speeds the eventual collapse of the Afghan government and the unviability of the US embassy in Kabul, which then leads us to a pre-9/11 collection posture where we have nothing in the country,"" said Marc Polymeropoulos, a former CIA operations officer.

Biden owns the risk

What those capabilities look like, however, remains unclear and sources tell CNN that previous administrations have wrestled with the same set of bad choices but were unable to identify a viable solution.

President Joe Biden speaks from the White House about the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan on April 14, 2021.

This was the case for Pentagon officials during the Trump administration, according to a source familiar with the situation who noted that the inevitable risks of bringing the number of US forces in Afghanistan to zero are why military and intelligence officials have long pushed for some kind of residual force.

That unavoidable counterterrorism trade-off also comes with a political risk of holding the bag if there's another 9/11-style attack against the US, which current and former officials agree has long been a driving force behind deliberations of this kind in the past.

Biden has ""agreed to take on that risk,"" one source familiar with internal Pentagon discussions about the same issue during the Trump administration told CNN.

0,US rejects Slovenia-linked EU plan to break up Bosnia [as a followup to Yugoslavia's break-up],https://euobserver.com/world/151572,"The US has said it is against the break-up of Bosnia, following a radical proposal widely attributed to incoming EU presidency Slovenia.

""The United States deeply values its longstanding partnership with Bosnia and Herzegovina. We support its sovereignty and territorial integrity, respect for which was enshrined in the Dayton Peace Accords,"" a state department spokesperson said on Thursday (15 April), referring to a 1995 peace deal which ended a bloody ethnic conflict.

Student or retired? Then this plan is for you.

The Croatian foreign minister, Grlić Radman, said the same one day earlier.

The comments arose after an informal policy paper, which came to light earlier this week, proposed an EU-led campaign to carve up the federation.

Its majority-ethnic Serb parts should join Serbia, its Croatian parts should join Croatia, and its rump would become an independent state for Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims), the policy paper said.

Kosovo should also join with Albania to create another new country, the paper, which was sent to EU Council president Charles Michel in February, added.

There is little doubt in diplomatic circles that Slovenia's populist prime minister, Janez Janša, who takes over the symbolic EU presidency in July, was behind it.

This is what Bosnia believes, after it summoned Slovenia's ambassador to Sarajevo to complain earlier this week.

This is what US diplomats believe, speaking off the record.

And this is what EU diplomats told Slovenian daily

Necenzurirano.si, which published the informal paper in its entirety.

But for his part, the usually pugnacious Janša is keeping quiet - neither conforming nor denying the reports - amid the negative reactions.

In the past, he called two women journalists he did not like ""worn-out prostitutes"" in an infamous tweet.

In late March, he also called two MEPs he did not like ""overpaid bureaucrats who were born into prosperity"" and likened them to the late Serbian dictator Slobodan Milošević.

But when asked by EUobserver if he sent the paper to Brussels, his staff replied: ""The office of the prime minister of the Republic of Slovenia does not further comment the topic on the so-called 'non-paper' document about the Western Balkans"".

His EU embassy also declined to comment.

But with Brussels bracing itself for six months of potential controversy under Janša's presidency, a Slovenian spokesman tried to calm tension.

Redrawing borders on ethnic lines in the Western Balkans is widely seen as a recipe for renewed instability.

But the Slovenian spokesman said: ""I can tell you that one of the main themes [of the presidency] will be a secure European Union, a good and reliable partner in the neighbourhood and in the world"".

""The Slovenian presidency will dedicate particular attention to the Western Balkans and lead the Council of the EU in the direction of continuing the process of EU enlargement with the countries of the region,"" he added.",471,2945,15,94

Many are calling the act disrespectful to Indigenous people, especially MMIWG.

The video was taken in the south end of Ladysmith along the railway tracks which run parallel to Highway 1.

It shows two individuals using a branch to remove several red dresses that are hung in the trees.

The red dresses have become a symbol for raising awareness of MMIWG and they can be seen along highways up and down Vancouver Island.

“When you see a red dress, it usually indicates that somebody has taken the time to recognize and honour the fact that there are thousands of missing and/or murdered Indigenous women and girls,” said Carla Voyageur, co-founder of the Lil’ Red Dress Project.

The incident took place on the traditional territory of the Stz’uminus First Nation.

A high-level meeting chaired by Prime Minister's Principal Secretary Ahmad Kaikaus might reach a decision on vaccine imports from the two countries on Sunday (Monday), Professor Dr ABM Khurshid Alam, director-general of the Directorate General of Health Services, told The Business Standard.

Besides, the government has decided to invite an international tender to buy vaccines, including Oxford-AstraZeneca developed Covishield and Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which can be stored at temperatures between 2°C and 8°C. Work is underway to finalise various conditions and documents of the proposed tender.

Health ministry officials say Chinese vaccine maker Sinopharm has sent a proposal to supply 60 lakh doses to Bangladesh through a third party. Several companies have also applied to the health ministry as a third party about three months ago, showing interest in importing Russia's vaccine Sputnik V and supplying it to the Bangladesh government.

The government also expects to get some vaccine doses from Covax in the first half of May. Covax is collecting the Oxford vaccine from South Korea after India has imposed a ban on all exports of the Oxford vaccine made by India's Serum Institute.

The government believes that it will be possible to continue the ongoing inoculation drive if Bangladesh gets the required doses from there.

Meanwhile, the director-general of the health directorate said they sent a letter to Beximco Pharmaceuticals and the Serum Institute of India last Saturday to supply vaccine doses to the government as per the deal.

In the letter, the health directorate has asked for a total of 1 crore doses of vaccine, including 50 lakh doses of March and 5o lakh of April, this month. They also urged the two companies to supply one crore doses scheduled for May and June on time.

Covax is expected to supply 6.8 crore doses of vaccine to Bangladesh. In the first shipment, it was supposed to give two crore doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca to Bangladesh towards the end of March. But Covax through a mail informed that it would supply the doses in the first week of May as it was facing a vaccine crisis because of India's ban on the Oxford vaccine export.

Health ministry officials say Covax has continued to try to collect vaccine doses from Serum despite India's export ban. AstraZeneca, the developer of Covishield, sent a notice to Serum on April 8 for not supplying doses to Covax as per the agreement.

Dr ASM Alamgir, principal scientific officer of the IEDCR and member of the Covid-19 Vaccine Preparedness and Deployment Core Committee, told TBS, ""We are also trying to get the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine through Covax to continue the first and the second shot.""

""Covax is collecting Oxford vaccine doses from South Korea alongside Serum. We are trying to get that vaccine. Even if it is available in mid-May, there will be no interruption in our vaccination programme,"" he added.

Alamgir said the government would buy three crore more doses of vaccine through an open tender. Vaccines of the companies that can be stored at temperatures between 2°C and 8°C will be given priority if they take part in the tender.

As per a deal with India's Serum Institute and Beximco, the Bangladesh government was supposed to get 50 lakh doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine every month. Bangladesh has so far received 70 lakh doses in two shipments under the deal.

The first consignment of 50 lakh doses of Oxford vaccine arrived in Dhaka from India on 25 January this year. Later, the second batch of 20 lakh doses from Serum arrived here on 22 February.

Besides, a consignment of 20 lakh doses, gifted by India, reached Dhaka on 21 January, and another consignment of 12 lakh doses, also gifted by India, arrived in Dhaka on 26 March.

Bangladesh has not yet received the remaining 30 lakh doses of February and 50 lakh doses of March and April as per the agreement.

Following India's ban on all exports of the Oxford vaccine made by Serum last month, Salman F Rahman, prime minister's private industry and investment adviser, had told The Business Standard that the Indian government assured that Bangladesh would remain out of the purview of the ban and would get supplies as per demand whenever necessary.

Salman F Rahman could not be contacted on the phone yesterday despite repeated attempts.

However, an official of Beximco said, ""Officials of the Indian High Commission in Dhaka had assured of supplying the vaccine to Bangladesh as per the demand. But they are now not keeping their promise. So, we have nothing to do now.""

India's Serum Institute has agreed to give the vaccine to Bangladesh, but it cannot supply it owing to the ban imposed by the Indian government. The tripartite agreement among the health ministry, Beximco Pharmaceuticals and Serum Institute of India also states that the vaccine cannot be imported without the prior approval of the Indian government, he added.

Bangladesh rolled out mass inoculation on 7 February with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by India's Serum Institute, and more than 57.14 lakh citizens have so far been immunised. On 7 April, the second dose inoculation began. Some 1.36 lakh people have been administered the second shot till now.

Bangladesh now has only 31.19 lakh doses of vaccine out of 1.2 crore doses.

More than one and a half lakh people are now getting vaccinated every day on average. If this continues, the vaccine doses will run out in the next 20-22 days.

Dr ASM Alamgir said, ""We slowed down the first dose immunisation. We will be able to vaccinate people with the second jab till mid-May the way the current per day inoculation rate continues. As the second dose can be given between eight weeks and three months, we are trying to avail vaccine during the break period.""

Meanwhile, India, the world's largest vaccine supplier, has also taken an initiative to import Sputnik V in the wake of the Covid vaccine crisis as the second wave accelerates.

The country, which typically produces 60% of vaccines sold globally, now cannot manufacture the Covid-19 vaccine at full capacity because of the US ban on exporting raw materials critical for vaccine production and the EU's similar restrictions around vaccine exports. So, India is now working to adapt to the materials which are made at home or the neighbouring countries like Singapore,"" but this will take time, reported CNN.",1089,6592,14,95
0,Alexey Navalny's press secretary says he's 'dying' as Russian prosecutors target his foundation,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/17/world/alexey-navalny-health-gets-worse/index.html,"Moscow (CNN) The Moscow Prosecutor's Office filed a lawsuit on Friday with Moscow City Court seeking to label jailed Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny's anti-corruption foundation known as FBK and his headquarters as ""extremist"" organizations.

Meanwhile, Navalny's supporters say that his medical condition is rapidly deteriorating. His press secretary said that Navalny was ""dying"" and his doctors said medical tests showed he's at growing risk of renal failure and heart problems.

If approved, the move by prosecutors could have serious consequences for Navalny's team in Russia. In Russian law, ""extremist"" organizations could be banned and liquidated, and activists who continue to work with them possibly face prison terms of up to 10 years.

""Under the cover of liberal slogans, these organizations are engaged in creating conditions for the destabilization of the social and socio-political situation,"" the prosecutor's office said in a statement on Friday.

The statement added the goals of the opposition organizations is to encourage ""color revolutions,"" a reference to popular uprisings in former Soviet republics which Russia considers to have been supported by Western governments.

""The actual goals of their activities are to create conditions for changing the foundations of the constitutional system, including using the scenario of the 'color revolution.' ""

Navalny continues his hunger strike

Attending physicians for Navalny , an outspoken critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said Saturday on Twitter they wrote a letter to Russian prison services (FSIN) requesting access to see Navalny.

They say latest medical tests showed he is at growing risk of renal failure and heart problems.

CNN is not able to independently verify the state of Navalny's health.

The letter shared on Twitter by a key Navalny ally and head of a prominent opposition doctor's union, Anastasia Vasilyeva, said Navalny's doctors have serious concerns about his current health condition.

""We urgently request to hold negotiations and an urgent medical conсilium with the medical workers of the Medical Unit No. 33 to discuss the diagnostic tests carried out and the treatment to be prescribed, as well as to take the patient out of a critical condition threatening a fatal outcome,"" a copy of the letter shared by Vasilyeva said. ""We ask to be admitted to the examination of our patient, who has been observed for many years.""

Earlier this week, FSIN told CNN in a statement that Navalny was treated April 5-9 in a medical unit in penal colony No. 2 in Pokrov where he is imprisoned. The statement said Navalny was transferred back to his prison squad due to an ""improvement"" of his health condition.

Navalny said in a post on his official Instagram account on Friday that he is being threatened with force-feeding as he continues a hunger strike. Navalny said Friday that his blood test results show his health is deteriorating.

He has been diagnosed with two hernias and is losing feeling in both hands, one of his lawyers, Olga Mikhailova, said in an interview with Russian media last week

He is on a hunger strike in protest of prison officials refusing to grant him access to proper medical care. The Kremlin said this week that it would not give him special treatment.

CNN has put in a request with the Russian Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) for a statement on Navalny's health.

As President Joe Biden departed Wilmington Country Club in Delaware on Saturday, he was asked about Alexei Navalny's condition in prison. He told reporters that it's ""totally, totally unfair, totally inappropriate.""

Press secretary urges supporters to rally

Despite Navalny being imprisoned, his team have continued his work against corruption and organizing protest rallies in support of the opposition figure.

Kyra Yarmysh, Navalny's press secretary and assistant, is asking Navalny's supporters to join a rally that was meant to call for his freedom, but is now ""a condition for his life.""

Yarmysh said that ""now Alexey is dying. In his condition, it is a matter of days. And on weekends, lawyers simply cannot get to him, and no one knows what will happen on Monday.""

In a Facebook post , she said a rally is ""being prepared to demand the release of Alexey. And it will be huge too. But I don't want it to happen for other reasons.""

Yarmysh is under house arrest and does not have access to electronic devices. Her team said they published the post on her behalf. They said Yarmysh still has communication with her lawyers and can pass on some information and statements to be published.

There is no announced date for the rally. His team said they will announce a date for the rally when they reach 500,000 signatures.

On Thursday, FBK released a new investigation about an official residence used by Putin near Lake Valdai northwest of Moscow which they allege contains expensive interiors and a spa center not declared to Russian taxpayers. CNN cannot independently verify FBK's claims.

FBK released a widely viewed investigation in January into what they allege is a palace owned by Russian President Vladimir Putin by the Black Sea, estimated to be worth more than $1 billion. Putin has denied the palace belongs to him or his family members and close aides.

Russia has designated other groups 'extremist'

In 2017, Russia's Supreme Court banned Jehovah's Witnesses as an ""extremist organization."" Other groups that have been designated as ""extremist"" include far-right and Islamist organizations.

Navalny's organizations have faced pressure before from Russian authorities being subjected to raids and searched and in 2019, Russia's Justice Ministry designated FBK a ""foreign agent"" group.

""We know how to work in conditions of constant searches and frozen accounts, in conditions of administrative arrests and criminal cases. We have been building our political organization for ten years, have learned to survive under unthinkable pressure, change, be effective and win in the most impossible situations,"" Ivan Zhdanov, director of FBK, and Leonid Volkov, chief of staff for Navalny, said in a joint statement on Friday.

""It is clear that the Kremlin's new attack is linked to the upcoming rally and the elections in September. So it is clear what the answer should be: hold a rally (perhaps this is the last rally in the next few years), and win elections (perhaps this is the last election for many years to come),"" the statement continued.",1064,6599,13,95

While states are announcing strict restrictions to curb the spread of the virus, cases are spiralling in Haridwar as lakhs take a dip in the holy water completely disregarding safety protocols. The Maha Kumbh Mela is witnessing a footfall of lakhs of pilgrims every day amid the second wave of coronavirus in the country.

Defending the crowd and the massive religious congregation, UP BJP leader Sunil Bharala, in an interview with NDTV, said, ""Kumbh ki aastha coronavirus see bhaut badi hai (faith of Kumbh is above Coronavirus).""

The BJP leader said that he had attended the Kumbh Mela and tested positive for COVID on April 13.

The leader brazenly said that faith and religious beliefs are above all COVID norms and guidelines.

""I went to Kumbh myself. I am COVID-19 positive.""

When asked about the massive crowds gathered for the religious congregation, the BJP leader said that the massive celebration is to ward off COVID and that ""Ganga ma"" will fight the virus.

Any virus loves crowds, but it adores crowds that violate all safety protocols.



The grand celebration in the name of ""faith"" in Haridwar has worsened the ongoing health crisis in the country. The careless message sent by the state government of Uttarakhand which refuses to curtail the event has added to the collective irresponsibility of the public amid a pandemic.

The website features on its Home Page a video message from Ghislaine's brother Ian, filmed in response to the court's recent rejection of her third bail application, detailing the ""cruel and unusual"" conditions of her detention and confirming her decision to appeal this latest ruling.

Visitors will find biographical information, interviews and articles, as well as answers to frequently asked questions, legal resources, and links to important bail reform initiatives. The site also details the punishing regime Ghislaine is being subjected to during her extraordinary pre-trial detention

""Because of the continuing misinformation, misrepresentation and mischief in much of the media, Ghislaine's family started this website, an important resource for the public,"" said David Oscar Markus, an attorney for the family and Ms. Maxwell. ""Ghislaine is innocent and her treatment by the press and the prison is unconscionable.""

Ghislaine is currently a pre-trial detainee at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York facing allegations by anonymous accusers that date back 25 years. She has been held in this American prison in effective solitary confinement without bail for 280 days and counting, locked in a six-foot by nine-foot cell sometimes for 12 hours a day. She has a light shone in her face every 15 minutes during the night and endures multiple privations that are impacting her health and ability to properly prepare her defense and all this in the middle of the pandemic.

Like anyone else, she has the right to be presumed innocent, a constitutional right which is fundamental to the fairness of the American system of justice.

Ghislaine is a wife, a stepmother, a friend to many and a sister to a family that loves her very much. They believe in her innocence and that she will be exonerated at trial.

Pending the opportunity for Ghislaine to be able to defend herself in a court of law, RealGhislaine.com will be updated frequently with exclusive content, news, commentary and useful resources to help visitors form a more balanced view about the real Ghislaine Maxwell. Members of the news media and anyone else interested in following her status are encouraged to register for email updates.

0,Police killing hundreds in Rio de Janeiro despite court ban on favela raids | Global development,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/apr/18/police-kill-hundreds-rio-de-janeiro-favela-raids-court-ban,"Nearly 800 people were killed by police in the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro in the past nine months, as raids remain a terrifying routine for favela families – despite a supreme court ruling to halt incursions during the coronavirus pandemic.

New figures show that between June 2020 and March 2021, 797 people were killed in Rio state, 85% in the city of Rio and surrounding metropolitan region.

The court ruled to suspend police raids in Brazilian favelas in June 2020, amid public outcry following the death of 14-year-old João Pedro Matos Pinto, who was shot in the back during a police incursion.

Between June and September, police raids plummeted 64% compared with the average for the same period in previous years, according to a report by Geni, a research group at the Federal Fluminense University (UFF).

But incursions resumed in October, one month after the acting governor, Cláudio Castro, took office and rapidly doubled to 38 in October, compared with the previous month. In the following nine months, the communities of Greater Rio saw an average of nearly one raid every day, the report showed.

“It’s absurd,” Daniel Hirata, an author of the report and professor of sociology at UFF, said. “The highest court takes a decision, and political authorities do not respect it, violate it deliberately. This is a risk to the rule of law in Brazil.”

On Friday, the state supreme court started a two-day public hearing on police raids to draw up a new plan to reduce police killings and human rights violations.

Police in Rio de Janeiro state, kill almost twice as many people each year as they do in the US. Most of the victims are black and brown.

A police spokesmen said the raids were launched in response to violent disputes for territory between warring gangs, and claim that they focus on “preserving lives and following strict legal precepts”.

But Hirata argued that “police raids, in addition to being lethal, are ineffective against crime”, and the report shows that such actions are not associated with any reduction in criminal activity.

A surge in police violence came after the 2018 election as Rio governor of Wilson Witzel, who had campaigned on a promise to “slaughter” criminals. Witzel was forced from office in late August 2020 after a corruption scandal, but his acting successor has pursued a similar frontal assault on drug gangs – and ordinary civilians are caught in the crossfire.

Police violence has also compounded the disastrous impact of coronavirus on Brazil’s most vulnerable. A study published by the Lancet showed that inequality was a larger factor in Covid deaths in Brazil than age, health status and other risk factors, where more than 355,000 have died from the disease.

Favela-based groups delivering food and cleaning products kits during the outbreak say they have often been forced to suspend operations because of police raids.

A 36-year-old female schoolteacher, who asked not to be named for security reasons, distributed kits and listened to daily struggles at her Parque Esperança (or Hope Park) community, in the municipality of Belford Roxo, in Greater Rio.

“I visited households and I saw several people living below the poverty line,” she said. “And amid this crisis, we have been living in a war state since January.”

The current wave of violence began when police launched an incursion to set up an outpost in a community in Belford Roxo, sparking retaliation from gangs.

Since then, the sound of police helicopters is constant, and shootings break out day and night.

Fransérgio Goulart, the head of a local activist group, said that while official figures said nine people had been killed in the community, local residents say that more than 30 have been shot since January.

“One case that shocked me was that of a young man who was shot dead going home from work. His mother spent hours with her son on her lap waiting for the body to be taken away. The whole family left the community afterwards,” she said.",686,4111,16,96

William Amos, who has represented the Quebec district of Pontiac since 2015, appeared on the screens of his fellow lawmakers completely naked Wednesday. The pandemic has meant many Canadian lawmakers participate in sessions via video conference instead of in person.

A screenshot obtained by The Canadian Press shows Amos standing behind a desk between the Quebec and Canadian flags, his private parts hidden by what appears to be a mobile phone in one hand.

“This was an unfortunate error,″ Amos said in a statement sent by email. ”`My video was accidentally turned on as I was changing into my work clothes after going for a jog. I sincerely apologize to my colleagues in the House of Commons for this unintentional distraction. Obviously, it was an honest mistake and it won’t happen again.”

Claude DeBellefeuille, a legislator for the opposition Bloc Quebecois party, raised the incident in a point of order after question period, suggesting that parliamentary decorum requires male Parliament members to wear a jacket and tie — and a shirt, underwear and trousers.

Speaker Anthony Rota later thanked DeBellefeuille for her “observations” and clarified that while he had not seen anything, he checked with technicians and confirmed they saw something. He reminded lawmakers to always be vigilant when they are near a camera and microphone.

Amos, the parliamentary secretary to Industry Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne, was visible only to Parliament members and staffers on an internal video conference feed. Because he was not speaking, his image did not show up on the public feed.

Liberal Party colleague Mark Holland said Amos was “utterly mortified.” Holland said he was satisfied with the explanation from his colleague.

0,‘Single-use plastics’ to be phased out in Australia from 2025 include plastic utensils and straws,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/16/single-use-plastics-to-be-phased-out-in-australia-from-2025-include-plastic-utensils-and-straws?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other,"Plastic cutlery and straws are among the types of single-use plastics to be phased out in Australia from 2025 under a plan to reduce plastic waste.

A national meeting of environment ministers on Thursday confirmed the phase-out would cover eight types of “problematic and unnecessary” plastic waste: lightweight plastic bags; plastic misleadingly labelled “degradable”; plastic utensils and stirrers; plastic straws; polystyrene food containers; polystyrene consumer goods packaging; and microbeads in personal care products.

The Australian government previously announced plans to phase out “single-use plastics” by the end of 2025, including banning the use of expanded polystyrene food containers by December 2022. But now federal, state and territory leaders have agreed on what that term will cover.

Conservationists have warned, however, the ambition will not be met unless the voluntary industry targets are backed up by tough regulation.

Queensland has passed laws to ban plastic straws, cutlery, plates, stirrers, and polystyrene food containers, with the legislation to take effect from September.

Thursday marked the first national environment ministers meeting since November 2019. A joint communique released on Thursday night said the ministers also agreed in principle to support a rollout of food organics and garden organics waste collection services, and to a “harmonisation of municipal waste collection” including new standards for kerbside waste collection.

Australia produces 2.5m tonnes of plastic waste each year, about 84% of which is sent to landfill. About 130,000 tonnes of plastic waste leaks into the environment annually.

Darren Kindleysides from the Australian Marine Conservation Society said national agreement on the types of single-use plastics covered by the ban would give businesses certainty and ease consumer confusion.

“This is welcome progress on these killer plastics and will help to ease the pressure on our marine wildlife,” he said. “We would urge our governments to take the further step of implementing national mandatory bans to ensure the good progress in some jurisdictions continues.”

According to the communique, the ministers also discussed “the vital role cooperation will play in building a more climate-resilient Australia” and a federal government promise to engage with state and territory governments in the lead-up to the Cop26 Glasgow climate change conference. It did not mention any specific strategies for emission reduction.

The ministers also agreed to support the national koala monitoring program.

Suzanne Milthorpe, the national environment laws campaigner for the Wilderness Society, had hoped for more action in response to the findings of the royal commission into national natural disaster arrangements and the review of Australia’s federal environment laws, both of which were handed to the government in 2020.

“There is a lot of ‘noting’ and ‘discussing’ but not a lot of acting, especially on behalf of the commonwealth,” she said.

Milthorpe criticised the federal government for failing to provide a formal response to the review of Australia’s environmental laws by Prof Graeme Samuel, who called for a major overhaul of the regulatory system.

“What is clear from the Samuel Review is that state and commonwealth governments must work together to raise the standard of environmental protection in Australia,” she said. “There is a reality gap between the current discussions and what is required to ensure icons like the koala and the Great Australian Bight have a future.”

The Samuel review made 38 recommendations to change the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act including the immediate introduction of legally-binding national standards. A draft of the proposed standards was included in the review.

The Morrison government instead drafted its own version of the interim standards, which were described by Senate crossbenchers as “substantially weaker” than those recommended by Samuel.

The communique said state and territory ministers “noted the national cabinet priority to introduce national environmental standards reflecting the current requirements of the EPBC Act”.

It said the ministers “noted the commonwealth’s commitment to subsequent phases of reform” and its “undertaking to provide a timeline for subsequent phases of reform”.

Basha Stasak from the Australian Conservation Foundation said she would welcome seeing that timeline – given the urgency of the Samuel review.

“The government’s proposed interim national standards are incredibly vague and weak and they really need to be disposed of,” Stasak said. “Any consultation that’s going to take place with the states and territories needs to be starting from scratch and based off the draft interim standards in Prof Samuels’ report.”",717,4827,15,97

Signs around the tent embassy emphatically highlight the long-simmering frustrations among a sizable portion of the community here.

Painted in the island’s colours of green and white, one placard reads ‘Du We Giw Up, We Gwen Win’ in the traditional Norf’lk language. The translation: ‘If we don’t give up, we will win’. Another reads ‘Norfolk under Siege’ in English.

In the centre of town on this eight-by-five-kilometre island, a field of green hands - each one hand-painted and signed by a different community member – also serves as a symbolic demand for self-determination.

“If I had to put a percentage on it, I would say 90 per cent of our identity is gone,” says Leah Honeywood, a seventh-generation Norfolk Islander whose lineage traces back to the first permanent settlers on the former penal colony.

With a population of some 1,700 people, Norfolk Island has a rich, unique culture, its own language and a colourful history.

If I had to put a percentage on it, I would say 90 per cent of our identity is gone. - Leah Honeywood, Norfolk Islander

In 1855, Queen Victoria granted Norfolk Island to the Pitcairn Islanders, descendants of the infamous Mutiny on the Bounty. A year later, 163 men, women and children were settled there.

As tears well around her eyes, Leah claims the legacy of her ancestors has been devastated in recent years.

SBS News/Omar Dehen

“They worked so hard and for so long to become a people and a race, and in five years someone has come in and obliterated that.”

“What’s changed is the Australian government has come in here and imposed their governance and their rules, and things like that just don’t apply to Norfolk.”

Island history

Britain transferred Norfolk Island to Australia in 1914, just prior to World War One. In 1979, it became Australia’s first non-mainland territory to be granted limited self-rule. The island quickly instilled its own democratically elected Legislative Assembly, funding its own services, while Australia still retained ultimate sovereignty and final approval of proposed laws.

But the picturesque island, which is crucially reliant on tourism, fell into economic turmoil in the wake of the 2007 Global Financial Crisis. Its chief minister then stunned locals two years later, when he agreed to surrender the island’s self-governing status to Australia for a bailout.

The most controversial decision of all came in 2015 when Canberra ultimately abolished the Legislative Assembly and appointed its own administrator.

The New South Wales Government currently manages services including health, education and policing, in return for federal government funding. Queensland is currently in negotiations to take over when the NSW contract expires.

Since the transfer, Norfolk Island’s 1,000 registered voters have been added to the electorate of Bean in the ACT.

Ron Ward, a former finance minister on Norfolk Island, says the island was running at an annual deficit of approximately $3 million a year following the GFC. He accuses the Australian government of carrying out “unnecessary … economic warfare against the island”.

“We have no say in anything that is being decided for us.”

“Everything is decided by expat workers and departmental staff in Canberra. It’s a most unsatisfactory way of running a place.”

We have no say in anything that is being decided for us. - Ron Ward, Norfolk Islander

Before Australia stepped in, a non-binding referendum in 2015 saw 68 per cent of islanders vote to keep self-rule.

A ‘Norfolk Island People for Democracy Movement’ has been growing ever since, and, with the support of local elders, took its fight to the United Nations. Since 2016 the movement has appealed to the UN and Human Rights Council to have Norfolk Island added to its list of ‘non-self-governing territories’. A ruling is yet to be handed down.

“Prior to 2016, the island did need something to change. I believe that could have happened through communication with the Australian government,” says Catherine McCoy, an eighth-generation Norfolk Islander.

“I would like to see the Australian government realise that we do have an identity, and I want that back. I would also like the United Nations to step in, so we can determine our future.”

Regional council suspended

But locals have been angered further recently after the Norfolk Island Regional Council, their last local authority, was suspended over the new year by the federal government after an independent audit raised concerns about its financial management.

Questions over the council’s viability are the centre of a public inquiry that began on Norfolk Island this week. But disillusioned islanders claim it is another example of democratic rights being denied.

“It’s definitely gone too far,” Ms McCoy says. “We have now no voice. We have no elected representation, and I don’t think that’s democratic in any community. I’m just angry about the whole situation.”

Land taxes, which for centuries never existed on the island, is one of the key grievances about Australian rule.

When Queen Victoria granted Norfolk to the Pitcairn Islanders, she also granted each family 50-acre lots. But in recent years Canberra has introduced property taxes.

Ron and Marlene Nobbs, who have been married for 56 years, live on the property of Ron’s ancestors.

Ron, a former Norfolk Chief Minister, says they can afford the rates, but Marlene, 83, adds that many descendants cannot.

“Norfolk has always been asset rich, but money poor,” Marlene says. “They fear that they are going to lose their land because they can’t afford to pay rates.”

Ron says properties on the island are made up of many portions, which tends to create higher taxes on such cash-poor families.

“In a suburban setting, land rates, property rates, are a very reasonable and workable system for collective revenues to run government services,” he says. “[But] in our situation here, it doesn’t work.”

Opposition not unanimous

Some, though, say life on Norfolk Island is better thanks to Australia. Cherrise Clarke has lived on the island for 40 years and describes the introduction of a social security system as “marvellous”.

“We now have a safety net,” she says. “During the past 12 months, I can’t imagine life without being integrated in the Australian tax system. The support we were given helped the island to survive.”

The administrator on Norfolk Island, Eric Hutchinson, admits the transition could have been better managed but says the decision was justified.

“We’re only a very short way through what will be a transition.”

“I’m the last person in the world that wants to see those intrinsic things that make Norfolk Island different to other parts of Australia change if they don’t have to change. But equally, there are things that this community, and I know for a fact, appreciate.”

Australia's Assistant Minister for Regional Development and Territories, Nola Marino, who represents Norfolk Island, echoed Mr Hutchinson’s sentiment in a statement.

“The transition … has given Norfolk Islander residents access to Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the Age Pension, child support, infrastructure investment (including $7 million this month for tourism spending to upgrade roads) and a wide range of other benefits,” Ms Marino said.

“Norfolk Islander residents have a strong representation in federal parliament … while electoral laws determine the population of Norfolk Island to be too small to have its own electorate.”

But for every person who points to reasons why Australian governance is working here on Norfolk Island, there are others who will dispute it, making it a deeply divisive issue in this otherwise tight-knit community.

Leah Honeywood and Catherine McCoy describe Norfolk Island culture as its “soul”. They claim that culture is in danger every time community representation is reduced.

“It is my family, it is my ancestors. They built and paid for this place since 1856 and I want to see that continue,” Ms McCoy says.

It is my family, it is my ancestors. They built and paid for this place since 1856. - Catherine McCoy, Norfolk Islander

Norfolk Island elder Shane McCoy says basic customs are beginning to disappear, including the tradition of waving to other drivers on the road. He claims that is tightly connected to the Australian transfer.

“I can’t say anything against Australia at all. We love Australia. But they’ve got to respect us as well,” he says.

“I just hope common sense prevails.”",1437,8905,17,97

Students were evacuated from their Halls of Residence earlier on Sunday, after the inferno made its way from Table Mountain, through Devil’s Peak, and into Newlands.

For now, the blaze is thought to be a wildfire. No foul play is suspected, but a windchange earlier on Sunday scuppered efforts to contain the flames. At that point, UCT found itself in deep trouble.

Precious archives, historic texts, and collections of African Studies are all in jeopardy this afternoon. The UCT Library is home to some classic publications, and has a long-standing history as an extraordinary hub for higher education.

After a year of off-campus learning, online classes, and various lockdown restrictions, the last thing this struggling group of students needs is a natural disaster at the heart of their university. This event is weighing heavy on both learners and Capetonians alike, who are powerless to intervene as a site of remarkable cultural significance gets gutted by fire.

In the past few days, three large boroughs of London have been in the spotlight of COVID surge testing.

Health officials tested around 650,000 people and it was reported ""dozens"" of cases of the South African variant were found in Wandsworth and Lambeth.

The figures released today would not have included any instances of the variant found in the surge testing - as it takes a few days for results to be confirmed.

The news comes as a coronavirus variant with a ""double mutation"" was detected in the UK after having first emerged in India.

A total of 77 cases of the variant, known as B.1.617, have been found across the country - 73 in England and four in Scotland - in the days leading up to 14 April, the latest update from PHE revealed.

The strain is of particular concern because it features two mutations in the spike protein combined in the same virus, prompting fears it may be more infectious or less susceptible to vaccines.

It has been classified as a ""variant under investigation"".

India reported a daily increase of 217,353 infections over the past 24 hours, the country's second record in consecutive days but the country is not on the UK government's 'red list' so there is no requirement for hotel quarantine of people travelling inward from there.

Instead, they are required to take two COVID tests and quarantine at home for 10 days.

Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the double mutation discovery could be cause for significant concern.

0,‘Absolutely devastating’: how Australia’s deportation of New Zealanders is tearing families apart.,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/apr/18/absolutely-devastating-how-australias-deportation-of-new-zealanders-is-tearing-families-apart,"On an overcast day at Brisbane airport in early February, a plain white Airbus 319 with an Australian flag marking on the tail was waiting on the tarmac.

Boarding the aircraft was Taryn O’Dowd, a New Zealand citizen who had lived in Australia for 32 years.

As deportees climbed the stairs on to the plane, a Channel Nine TV crew that had been given access by former immigration minister Peter Dutton asked questions.

“How does it feel to be kicked out of Australia?” the reporter asked one of them. Then later, “Our country doesn’t want you, are you excited to go home?”, before Dutton said: “It’s taking the trash out.”

For O’Dowd, the indignity of having a bit part in the immigration minister’s political pantomime wasn’t the worst part. It was the injustice of leaving behind her 12-year-old daughter and eight-year-old son, who she will never be able to visit in Australia, that really stung.

“I don’t understand how they can take a mother away from their children,” O’Dowd says. “My crimes weren’t insignificant, but they weren’t that monumental. This is a life sentence for me.”

O’Dowd was deported after she was jailed on a drug-related matter. Amendments to visa laws in 2014 required the cancellation of the visa of anyone who has received a prison sentence of 12 months.

Before being deported, O’Dowd thought of herself as Australian above anything else.

“I got to New Zealand and I don’t sound like a New Zealander so everyone thinks I’m an Aussie,” she says. “It’s like you don’t have a place in the world any more, everything that made you who you were is gone.

He’s never going to be able to come back to see his son Christel, mother of deportee

As the drama unfolded on the Brisbane tarmac, Oliver* was sitting in a Brisbane prison. The 31-year-old New Zealand citizen was facing deportation at the end of his 12-month sentence for a drug-related charge, which meant his visa was automatically cancelled.

Oliver, who has lived in Australia since the age of six, was set to join the ranks of many others who have been deported from a country they thought was their home.

His mother, Christel, says the move would cause huge damage to Oliver and his family.

“It’s been very traumatic for my son to think about being deported to a country he hasn’t grown up in and he’s never going to be able to come back to see his son,” Christel says.

‘Things will never be the same’

Another deportee, Henry*, was one of the first New Zealanders deported from Australia after the law change in 2014. Henry had earlier served a two-year prison sentence for assault, and after serving a further 18 months in Sydney’s Villawood Detention Centre, he was deported to New Zealand in 2015, leaving behind his young daughter.

Henry had lived in Australia since he was six years old, and had no connections or family in New Zealand.

His mother, Deborah, who is now caring for Henry’s daughter, says he had turned his life around after the jail sentence and before the deportation.

“He was a role model prisoner,” Deborah says. “When he got out he was going well, he was back with his family and was so happy. They had a great life, they had a lot of potential. But then that law change smashed him to pieces.”

The deportation has devastated the lives of Deborah and her family, she says.

“Things will never be the same,” Deborah says. “We don’t really enjoy life any more. I’m not the same.”

“It’s just unbelievable that this government could do this to families, to their own neighbours. We’re not the only family ripped apart and suffering because of this.”

Difficult to fight

For those fighting deportation, it can be a long journey.

In Oliver’s case, his family successfully challenged his visa cancellation at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

He had been jailed on a drug charge that stemmed from an addiction his family says was caused by childhood trauma. He initially served four months of this sentence before being released, and then managed to turn his life around.

“He has a three-year-old son and the thought of never seeing him turned his world upside down,” Christel says. “He did everything to turn his life around.”

But midway through last year, the police decided to pursue Oliver’s case again. He decided to serve the remainder of the 12-month sentence, and return to a Brisbane prison in August last year.

That week, the government again cancelled his Australian visa.

“It’s absolutely devastating,” Christel says. “We had no idea that just by him going back to prison he would immediately have his visa cancelled again. We were so upset, we couldn’t believe it.”

This is despite Oliver’s charge being his first offence, and a non-violent, relatively minor drug-related one.

But the family had some good news this week. Thanks to a costly immigration lawyer, they have again successfully challenged the cancellation of Oliver’s visa and he can remain in Australia with his family. Christel says she is “over the moon”, but is aware that not everyone can afford to mount the same legal defence.

Policy ‘tearing families apart’

Barrister and Australian Lawyers Alliance justice spokesperson Greg Barns has represented several New Zealanders facing deportation.

“These are very, very difficult cases,” Barns says. “It’s not only the individual, but it’s also the family and their loved ones, particularly children. I’ve seen families torn apart as a result of the policy of the Australian government.

Getting rid of us hasn’t stopped the drug problem in Australia, it has just left broken families Taryn O'Dowd, deportee

“When it comes to deportation, the Australian government has no sense of humanity whatsoever. These are harrowing cases. Often people stay in immigration detention for a number of years while the case is being decided.”

New Zealanders stripped of their Australian visa do not have access to legal aid to fight this decision, and fees for immigration lawyers can typically reach hundreds of thousands of dollars, locking out most of the people facing deportation.

O’Dowd is hoping to educate the general public in Australia on what’s happening with these deportations.

“I feel like people don’t understand that we have done our time – they think we get sentenced and then get deported, they say ‘do the crime, serve the time’. But I did serve the time,” she says.

“Considering most of us have lived in Australia for so long, our crimes are more indicative of Australian culture than anything else. Getting rid of us hasn’t stopped the drug problem in Australia, it has just left broken families.”

The president’s remarks followed his administration’s rollout of new sanctions on Russia for election interference, hacking and other “malign activities,” including the current military buildup on Ukraine’s borders and the persecution of dissidents such as Alexei Navalny. The sanctions include moves against Russian technology companies accused of supporting their country’s intelligence services, as well as prohibiting U.S. financial institutions from participating in the primary market for Russian sovereign debt.

“We could have gone further, but I chose not to do so. I chose to be proportionate,” Biden said. “The United States is not looking to kick off a cycle of escalation and conflict with Russia. We want a stable, predictable relationship.”

But the president then added: “If Russia continues to interfere with our democracy, I’m prepared to take further actions to respond.”

Biden on Tuesday spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The White House said he expressed concern over the military buildup on Ukraine’s borders, and he proposed a summit meeting to discuss the full range of U.S.-Russia issues.

If the summit occurs, the U.S. and Russia could “launch a strategic stability dialogue,” Biden said in his speech on Thursday. “We can address critical, global challenges that require Russia an the United States to work together, including reining in nuclear threats from Iran and North Korea, ending this pandemic globally and meeting the existential crisis of climate change.”

The new sanctions on Russia weren’t universally praised in Washington. John Bolton, a hawk who served as national security adviser in the Trump administration before falling out with former President Donald Trump, said the actions don’t go far enough.

“Today’s sanctions fall short. Specifically, there is no mention of the Nord Stream II pipeline,” Bolton said in a tweet, referring to a subsea pipeline for natural gas NGK21, +1.53% being built between Russia and Germany that’s been the target of U.S. sanctions threats.

When asked about the pipeline following his speech, Biden said he has opposed it for a long time, but it’s “a complicated issue affecting our allies in Europe.”

A month ago, the president said he thinks Putin is a killer and warned that his Russian counterpart will “pay a price” after an American intelligence assessment said Putin authorized operations last year intended to hurt Biden’s White House campaign and exacerbate tension in the U.S.",427,2759,15,98

On 25 April 1986, reactor number 4 at the Chernobyl nuclear power planet exploded – killing some people instantly and many more over the following years. Radioactive material covered the surrounding area, laying waste to territory both in Ukraine and across the border in Belarus.

While desperate efforts took place to limit the destruction, the wind carried nuclear debris across Europe, reaching as far as Sweden in just 24 hours.

The site of the blast is still contaminated and cleaning up the area is expected to take decades.

Yet on the eve of the 35th anniversary, Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) will operate what it calls a “Flight over Kyiv and Chernobyl”.

The company says: “On the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, Ukraine International Airlines invites you to take the opportunity and visit the unique flight ‘Flight over Kyiv and Chernobyl’, which will take place on the eve of the anniversary – April 25!

“Passengers of the flight will be able not only to see Kyiv and Chernobyl from the most unusual angles and the minimum allowable height - 900 metres [3,000 feet] – but also to deepen their knowledge about the causes and consequences of the Chernobyl accident.”

Participants are offered the chance to “take a photo in the cockpit and take a selfie with the pilot”, presumably while the plane is on the ground rather than in the air.

One of the tour companies that normally runs terrestrial trips to the exclusion zone will be onboard.

The airline says the flight will be accompanied by “aviation stories from UIA pilots who will fly with passengers in the cabin”.

There will also be a raffle for “souvenirs and gifts from UIA” with a top prize of a day trip to the Chernobyl zone, “one of the most popular tourist locations in the world”.

The cost is 2,970 Ukrainian hryvnia (£77), much less than most “flights to nowhere”.

British tourists will be unable to take part because the UK government bans non-essential travel overseas.

Before the flight, UIA recommends: “You can plunge into the whirlpool of emotions of the flight and watch a video from UIA co-pilot Ivan Iliuchenko.”

Dr Claire Corkhill, reader in Nuclear Material Corrosion at the University of Sheffield, said the experience should not be dangerous for participants.

“Now that the new safe confinement – the large arch covering the reactor – is in place, the radioactive particles in the reactor are completely sealed in, so there should be no issues with flying over the top,” she told The Independent.

“And 35 years after the disaster is roughly the equivalent of one half life of the most radioactive elements in the reactor. So the gamma rays that are emitted from the hole in the top of the reactor building are not only shielded by the new safe confinement, but they are half as intense as they were at the time of accident.”

Dr Corkhill added: “I often watch airplane maps on long-haul flights to spot when we’re flying over nuclear reactors, but this is really something.”

Several other airlines have offered “joy flights” during the coronavirus pandemic, as international air travel remains in a deep slump.

The latest was an Emirates flight from its hub in Dubai, notable because everyone on board had been vaccinated.

The latest and biggest has been the giving of passports with fake identities to international crime bosses now dubbed “Mafia”.

The scandal involves the issuing of at least 214 passports with fake identities to foreign criminals and high-risk individuals by the Interior Ministry, some of whom have direct links to the government.

Exposing the depth of the scandal, a video was also released of police cars escorting a Turkish crime lord that received a fake identity passport, while photos on social media show an off duty policeman acting as a bodyguard to the same figure as he walks through the streets in Skopje.

In an interview for the news portal Nezavisen, The President of the Macedonian office of Transparency International, Slagjana Taseva, said the country has now been placed on a “special list” internationally due to the case.

Taseva underscored that the investigation has to confirm the exact amount of passports that have been issued since at least a group of nine individuals within the Ministry began its criminal dealings through a middleman, who is still on the run.

As a result of the affair, the country risks being removed from the visa-free travel regime introduced in December 2009.

VMRO MP Antonijo Miloshoski stated in a briefing that the Government must make an urgent request to the EU General Directorate for internal affairs for an internal revision of the case and the mechanisms in the Interior Ministry by experts from the EU.

According to Miloshoski, this can help Macedonia uphold the visa liberalization decision from the EU.

The affair has exposed the level of corruption within the Interior Ministry and holes in the vetting process of employees, who are typically selected based on ruling party loyalty.

The leader of the opposition, Hristian Mickoski exposed the scandal on Monday night in a televised address. The following day there were raids and arrests on those employed in the ministry.

The government accused the opposition of de-railing the ongoing operation by exposing the corruption before it finished the investigation and threatened Mickoski with sanctions.

Mickovski stated on Thursday night that he was bound by the Law to disclose documents in his possession that are of public interest, as these point to corruption inside a government institution. He also revealed on national television that he has been receiving death threats since exposing the scandal.

Při vstupu do Česka se oba prokázali krycími pasy vystavenými rozvědkou GRU, které později použili během akce ve Velké Británii. Cestovní dokumenty byly vydány na fiktivní jména Ruslan Boširov a Alexandr Petrov.

Veřejně deklarovaným cílem jejich cesty byla návštěva muničního skladu ve Vrběticích, kam se dopředu objednali. Každý, kdo chce zařízení z obchodních důvodů navštívit, musí jeho správcům předem poslat e-mail se žádostí, v jakém časovém rozmezí chtějí přijít; v případě cizinců musí dodat i kopie pasů. Čepiga s Miškinem se do Vrbětic objednali e-mailem, který byl podle policejní expertizy zbaven všech metadat. To znemožňuje určit, odkud přesně byl odeslán.

K výbuchu v muničním skladu č. 16 došlo 16. října v 9:25. Policie zatím nemá přímý důkaz, že do areálu oba muži fyzicky skutečně vstoupili, ale považuje tuto hypotézou za vysoce reálnou.

Vyvozuje to z jejich příletu do Česka v daném období, přesunu na Moravu, kde se sklad nachází, ze zaslané žádosti o návštěvu i z použití krycích pasů, s nimiž byli posléze ve Británii v bojové akci. Další indicií jsou některé dnes už prozrazené násilné akce, kterých se oba účastnili - nejznámější je zmiňovaný případ ze Salisbury.

Právě v době, kdy se měli Čepiga s Miškinem ve Vrběticích nacházet, se tu podle policie vyskladňovaly zbraně, které měl nakoupit jeden z významných bulharských obchodníků se zbraněmi. Zřejmě dodával zbraně na Ukrajinu, která byla právě ve válce s Ruskem. Obchodník je měl prodávat ukrajinským silám, což by se pochopitelně nelíbilo Moskvě. Kdyby tak byly zbraně znehodnoceny s pomocí výbušného zařízení umístěného do zásilky, poškodilo by to obchodníka v očích jeho partnerů.

Policie pracuje s verzí, že právě kvůli tomu Čepiga s Miškinem přijeli. „Výbušný systém se dosud nepodařil najít, protože vrbětický areál byl zcela zničený. K výbuchu zřejmě nemělo dojít v Česku, ale až později při transportu zbraní v jiné zemi,“ tvrdí zdroj dobře obeznámený s vyšetřováním.

Pokud je tato hypotéza pravdivá, pak mohl sklad vybouchnout předčasně. Není vyloučeno, že zmínění zahynuvší zaměstnanci Havránek a Petřík mohli s materiálem manipulovat a tím explozi způsobit. Vrbětický areál si dlouhodobě pronajímá od státního podniku Vojenský technický ústav společnost Imex Group.

Důležitý terč

Jak se posléze ukázalo, důležitým terčem pro GRU byl bulharský obchodník se zbraněmi Emilian Gebrev. V roce 2015 – což později potvrdilo vyšetřování mezinárodní investigativní skupiny Bellingcat a také bulharské policie - se členové ruské rozvědky měli podílet na dvou pokusech o otravu tohoto byznysmena. Poprvé k tomu došlo v hlavním městě Sofii, podruhé o měsíc později v jeho letním domě u Černého moře.

V květnu 2015 se Gebrevovi náhle udělalo špatně a začal zvracet na večeři v luxusní restauraci v centru hlavního bulharského města. Měl oči podlité krví, den nato upadl do kómatu. Lékaři zjistili, že někdo obchodníka s jeho dvěma společníky otrávil. Vyšetřovatelé neúspěšně ukončili pátrání po pachatelích útoku o rok později. Případ však obnovili v roce 2018, když došlo k otravě Sergeje Skripala.

Bulharská prokuratura tehdy získala nové informace a obvinila z pokusu o vraždu Gebreva dva ruské občany spojené s GRU. Motiv atentátu zůstal nevyřešen, nejčastěji se spekulovalo o tom, že Gebrevovo impérium dodávalo zbraně ukrajinskému ministerstvu vnitra a Národní gardě, jejíž členové bojovali ve válce na Donbasu proti proruským separatistům.

Zahraniční aktivity ruské vojenské rozvědky GRU se podařilo poprvé odhalit poté, co se ruští hackeři prolomili do počítačů Demokratické strany před americkými prezidentskými volbami v roce 2016 a snažili se ovlivnit kampaň v neprospěch Hillary Clinton. Jak později zjistil deník The New York Times, sídlo jednotky 29155 specializované na zahraniční akce je ve výcvikovém středisku GRU na východě Moskvy a její členové prošli řadou krvavých konfliktů v Afghánistánu, Čečensku i na Ukrajině.

Bellingcat a Respekt: Útočník na Skripala je zraněný hrdina z Dagestánu

I v samotné GRU podléhala práce jednotky vysokému stupni utajení. „Skupina známá jako jednotka 29155 funguje nejméně deset let, západní představitelé ji však objevili teprve nedávno. Úředníci zpravodajských služeb ve čtyřech západních zemích říkají, že není jasné, jak často je mobilizována, a varují, že nejde dopředu určit, kdy a kde její agenti zaútočí,“ napsal v minulosti list The New York Times.

O členech jednotky 29155 jsou stále známy jen útržkovité informace. Vede ji generálmajor Andrej V. Averjanov, který v roce 1988 absolvoval vojenskou akademii v Taškentu v tehdejší Uzbecké sovětské socialistické republice. Je pravděpodobné, že se účastnil první i druhé rusko-čečenské války, v roce 2015 byl vyznamenán jako Hrdina Ruské federace. Právě jeho fotografii otiskl list NY Times: Averjanov je na ní zachycen v roce 2017 na svatbě své dcery a pózuje se zmíněným členem jednotky Anatolijem Čepigou, který se podílel na otravě Sergeje Skripala.

Respekt již v minulosti zjistil, že v roce 2014, kdy vybuchl vrbětický muniční areál, navštívil Česko Alexandr Miškin s dalším příslušníkem jednotky Denisem Vjačeslavovičem Sergejevem. Ten zde vystupoval pod krycím jménem Sergej Fedotov; i on se později účastnil akce proti Skripalovi, jeho skutečné jméno odhalila v roce 2019 společná investigace Bellingcatu s Respektem. Bylo to již na konci ledna, tedy devět měsíců před příjezdem Čepigy a Miškina na severní Moravu. Miškin se Sergejevem se tenkrát ubytovali v pražském hotelu Best Western Meteor Plaza v Hybernské ulici. Jestli už tehdy byli v Česku kvůli Vrběticím a připravovali budoucí operaci, není dodnes jasné.",1170,7719,16,98

Among those sentenced was Jimmy Lai, 72, who founded the pro-democracy Apple Daily newspaper. Lai received 14 months in prison for his involvement in two protests on August 18 and 31, 2019.

Also jailed for taking part in both events was Lee Cheuk-yan, a 64-year-old former lawmaker and veteran pro-democracy activist, who received a total of 14 months in prison. Three former lawmakers were jailed over the August 18 march, including ""Longhair"" Leung Kwok-hung, who received an 18 month sentence, Au Nok-hin, 10 months, and Cyd Ho, 8 months.

During Friday's sentencing hearing, judge Amanda Woodcock said the defendants ""deliberately defied the law"" and the unauthorized protests posed ""a direct challenge to the authority of the police, and therefore law and order.""

She said sentence imposed should ""reflect the seriousness of the offense and culpability,"" as well as the ""conscious decision"" by the defendants to break the law.

The Castro family has led the party since 1961.

“As I live I will be ready with my foot in the stirrups to defend the fatherland, the revolution and socialism,"" Castro told party delegates at a convention in Havana on Friday.

Also on rt.com Annex Cuba? Left & right unite to bash ‘woke’ neocon imperialist Bill Kristol for advocating US takeover of island nation

Raul has served as First Secretary of the Cuban Communist Party since 2011, when he replaced his late brother, Fidel Castro. Fidel became prime minister (later president) of Cuba following the 1959 revolution, and first secretary of the party two years later.

Raul Castro stepped down from the presidency in 2018, when Miguel Diaz-Canel took over the office, but remained in charge of the party.

Cuba remains one of the last few communist states in existence, despite Raul Castro introducing some limited free market reforms in 2011. The country’s healthcare system and literacy rate rank impressively high compared to some capitalist nations, but consumer goods are hard to come by. A state salary in Cuba is just $20 per month, and there are only 173,000 cars between the country’s 11 million people.

Whichever party loyalist fills Castro’s shoes will have to grapple with a stagnant economy, as well as strained relations with the US. While Donald Trump sanctioned and forbade travel and commerce with the island nation during his term, President Joe Biden has promised to thaw relations with Cuba. However, he has yet to change any of Trump’s policies.

0,The coming May Day holiday，Ticket bookings foretell explosive tourism for May Day holidays in China,https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202104/1221262.shtml,"Tourists wait for their trains at Hangzhou East Railway Station on Tuesday as the 5-day May Day holiday ends. Photo: VCG





Train tickets to some of the most popular destinations for this year's May Day holiday sold out the moment they became available, causing platforms to temporarily crash, foretelling an explosive holiday season starting on May 1.



According to qunar.com, an online travel agency, train tickets departing on April 30 has already sold out for several popular routes, including from Beijing to beach resort Beidaihe, and from Xi'an in Northwest China's Shaanxi Province to Chengdu in Southwest China's Sichuan. Changsha in Central China's Hunan and Wuhan in Hubei and Chongqing are among the destinations in top demand.



The demand on Friday for booking holiday tickets was so high that the surging traffic caused a temporary crash on the official booking website 12306.com.



""I tried wearing and taking off my glasses, binding and not binding my hair, and walked to the brighter living room to pass the facial recognition check on the app, but failed five or six times,"" a Beijing resident surnamed Zhang told the Global Times on Friday.



""Only when I browsed social media did I realize it wasn't my problem, it was that 12306 was down,"" Zhang said. She was trying to purchase a ticket to her hometown, Luoyang in Central China's Henan Province, which also has many historical sites and tourist spots.



Apart from railway travels, China's domestic civil aviation industry has also come up with a vengeance, based on bookings for the coming holiday. According to the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), the five-day May Day holiday will ""fully release"" the transportation demand in China that had been previously suppressed by the pandemic.



The CAAC estimates that, based on current bookings, both the volume and prices of tickets will significantly surpass the level from the same period in 2019. It also advised that passengers avoid travelling on peak days of the holiday, which fall on first and last days of the May Day holiday; that is, on April 30, May 1 and May 5.



The spike in domestic travel, compared to international flight routes that are still mired in global travel restrictions, has led China's airline companies to shift most of their resources to domestic flights. At the end of March, a total of 322 flight routes were added to the summer and autumn operation seasons.



Tourism and travel have mostly resumed to pre-pandemic levels in China. China's civil flight passenger volume increased 216 percent to 47.8 million trips in March, according to CAAC. Domestic trips in March have recovered to the same level in the same period of 2019, and total trips in Q1 increased 38 percent.



""The worst days for the civil aviation industry have passed,"" market watcher Qi Qi said, ""and with the full recovery of the economy, airline companies are expected to see their profits grow in leaps and bounds as people's demand for domestic travel resumes.""



However, as profits and demand resume, Chinese airlines' ""fly freely"" programs, unveiled during the pandemic, are facing online backlash among consumers, who said that they can't redeem their rewards as promised now that demand is rebounding. The CAAC urged companies to improve their services and protect customers' rights during a press conference held on Friday.

0,Facebook planned to remove fake accounts in India – until it realized a BJP politician was involved,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/15/facebook-india-bjp-fake-accounts?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other,"Facebook allowed a network of fake accounts to artificially inflate the popularity of an MP from India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), for months after being alerted to the problem.

The company was preparing to remove the fake accounts but paused when it found evidence that the politician was probably directly involved in the network, internal documents seen by the Guardian show.

The company’s decision not to take timely action against the network, which it had already determined violated its policies, is just the latest example of Facebook holding the powerful to lower standards than it does regular users.

“It’s not fair to have one justice system for the rich and important and one for everyone else, but that’s essentially the route that Facebook has carved out,” said Sophie Zhang, a former data scientist for Facebook who uncovered the inauthentic network. Zhang has come forward to expose the company’s failure to address how its platform is being used to manipulate political discourse around the world.

Facebook’s failure to act against the MP will also raise questions about Facebook’s relationship with the Hindu nationalist party. Facebook has repeatedly treated rule violations by BJP leaders with undue leniency, the Wall Street Journal reported in August 2020.

Since Narendra Modi and the BJP harnessed the power of Facebook and took power in India’s 2014 general election, deceptive social media tactics have become commonplace in Indian politics, according to local experts.

“Politicians in India are ahead of the curve when it comes to adopting these manipulative techniques, and so this leveraging of social media for political means is only to be expected,” said Nikhil Pahwa, an an Indian digital rights activist and founder of MediaNama. “This is an arms race between the social media platforms and those who are generating inauthentic behavior.”

All of the major political parties in India benefit from deceptive techniques to acquire fake likes, comments, shares or fans, Zhang found. Ahead of India’s 2019 general election, she worked on a mass takedown of low-quality scripted fake engagement on political Pages across all parties, resulting in the removal of 2.2m reactions, 1.7m shares and 330,000 comments from inauthentic or compromised accounts.

In December 2019, Zhang detected four sophisticated networks of suspicious accounts that were producing fake engagement – ie likes, shares, comments and reactions – on the Pages of major Indian politicians. Two of the networks were dedicated to supporting members of the BJP, including the MP; the other two supported members of the Indian National Congress, the leading opposition party.

An investigator from Facebook’s threat intelligence team determined that the networks were made up of manually controlled inauthentic accounts that were being used to create fake engagement. They did not rise to the level of “coordinated inauthentic behavior” – the term Facebook applies to the most serious deceptive tactics on its platform, such as the Russian influence operation that interfered in the 2016 US election – but they still violated the platform’s rules.

The investigator recommended that the accounts be sent through an identity “checkpoint” – a process by which suspicious accounts are locked unless and until the account owner can provide proof of their identity. Checkpoints are a common enforcement mechanism for Facebook, which allows users to have just one account, under the user’s “real” name.

On 19 December, a Facebook staffer checkpointed more than 500 accounts connected to three of the networks. On 20 December, the same staffer was preparing to checkpoint the approximately 50 accounts involved in the fourth network when he paused.

“Just want to confirm we’re comfortable acting on those actors,” he wrote in Facebook’s task management system. One of the accounts had been tagged by Facebook’s “Xcheck” system as a “Government Partner” and “High Priority – Indian”, he noted. The system is used to flag prominent accounts and exempt them from certain automated enforcement actions.

It was the MP’s own account, Zhang realized, and its inclusion in the network constituted strong evidence that either the MP or someone with access to his Facebook account was involved in coordinating the 50 fake accounts. (The Guardian is aware of the MP’s identity but is choosing not to reveal it since the evidence of his involvement in the network is not definitive. The MP’s office did not response to requests for comment.)

Political ambitions may explain why an MP would attempt to acquire fake likes on his Facebook posts.

“The worth of a politician is now determined by his social media followers, with Modi leading among most world leaders,” said Srinivas Kodali, a researcher with the Free Software Movement India. “Popularity on social media doesn’t directly help acquire real power, but it has become a means to enter politics and rise up in the ranks.

Task management documents show that Zhang repeatedly sought approval to move ahead with the checkpoints. “For completeness and [to] avoid accusations of biased enforcement, could we also come to an assessment on the cluster acting on [the MP]?” she wrote on 3 February. No one responded.

On 7 August, she noted the still unresolved situation, writing: “Given the close ties to a sitting member of the Lok Sabha, we sought policy approval for a takedown, which we did not receive; and the situation was not deemed to be a focus for prioritization.” Again there was no response.

And on her final day at Facebook in September 2020, she updated the task one last time to flag that there was a “still-existing cluster of accounts associated with” the MP.

“I asked about it repeatedly, and I don’t think I ever got a response,” Zhang said. “It seemed quite concerning to myself because the fact that I had caught a politician or someone associated with him red-handed was more of a reason to act, not less.”

Facebook provided the Guardian with several contradictory accounts of its handling of the MP’s network. The company initially denied that action on the network had been blocked and said the “vast majority” of accounts had been checkpointed and permanently removed in December 2019 and early 2020.

After the Guardian pointed to documents showing that the checkpoints had not been carried out, Facebook said that “a portion” of the cluster had been disabled in May 2020, and that it was continuing to monitor the rest of the network’s accounts. It later said that a “specialist team” had reviewed the accounts and that a small minority of them had not met the threshold for removal but were nevertheless now inactive.

The company did not respond to questions about why the accounts had not been checkpointed in December, when the investigator first recommended the enforcement. It also did not respond to questions about which specialist team was involved in the May review of the accounts, nor why this review and enforcement was not recorded in the task management system. It claimed that the policy team was not responsible for blocking any action.

A Facebook spokesperson, Liz Bourgeois, said: “We fundamentally disagree with Ms Zhang’s characterization of our priorities and efforts to root out abuse on our platform. We aggressively go after abuse around the world and have specialized teams focused on this work. Over the years, our teams investigated and publicly shared our findings about three CIB takedowns in India. We’ve also continuously detected and taken action against spam and fake engagement in the region, in line with our policies.”

While Zhang was trying and failing to convince Facebook to take action on the MP’s network, Facebook’s staff took repeated action against one of the two Indian National Congress networks that it had tried to remove in December. Though the checkpoints had knocked out most of the fake accounts, Facebook saw immediate efforts to reconstitute with new accounts and, in the weeks ahead of the 2020 state elections in Delhi, the network that had previously boosted a Congress politician in Punjab began supporting AAP, the anti-corruption party in Delhi.

In the comments of posts by BJP politicians in Delhi, the fake accounts represented themselves as supporters of Modi who were nevertheless choosing to vote for AAP in the state elections. The intervention may have been a result of political actors attempting to support the party in Delhi with the best chance to defeat the BJP, since Congress enjoys little support in local Delhi politics. Facebook undertook multiple rounds of checkpointing to knock out the network.

The MP’s case was not the first time that Facebook’s lower standards toward politicians violating its rules against inauthentic behavior prompted concern among some staff. “If people start realizing that we make exceptions for Page admins of presidents or political parties, these operators may eventually figure that out and deliberately run their [coordinated inauthentic behavior] out of more official channels,” a researcher said to Zhang during a June 2019 chat about the company’s reluctance to take action against a network of fake accounts and Pages boosting the president of Honduras.

The issue is particularly sensitive in India, where Facebook has come under fire by opposition politicians for allowing BJP politicians to break its rules, particularly with regard to anti-Muslim hate speech.

Facebook’s head of public policy for India, Ankhi Das, overruled policy staff who had determined that the BJP politician T Raja Singh should be designated a “dangerous individual” – the classification for hate group leaders – over his anti-Muslim incitement, according to an August 2020 Wall Street Journal report. Das resigned following the Journal’s reporting on her open support for Modi’s 2014 campaign. Facebook denied any bias or wrongdoing.",1616,10124,17,99

Prime Minister Andrej Babis said in an emergency press conference on April 17 that the decision to expel the diplomats was made on the basis of ""unequivocal evidence"" provided by investigators from the Czech intelligence and security services, and that there was ""reasonable suspicion regarding a role of members of Russian military intelligence GRU's unit 29155 in the explosion of the munition depot in Vrbetice in 2014.""



Babis said that the blast in the country's eastern Zlin region, near the Czech-Slovak border, ""inflicted immense material damage, seriously endangered and disrupted the lives of many local residents, and, most importantly, killed two of our citizens -- unsuspecting, innocent fathers of their families.""

As a sovereign state, Babis said, the Czech Republic ""must react to these unprecedented revelations in a corresponding manner.""



The explosion October 16, 2014, blast in Vrbetice set off 50 metric tons of stored ammunition. Two months later, another blast of 13 tons of ammunition occurred at the same site.



Interior Minister Jan Hamacek said that all diplomats in the Russian Embassy who had been identified as intelligence operatives had been ordered to leave the Czech Republic within 48 hours.



Czech police announced the same day that they were searching for two suspected Russian agents carrying various passports, including Russian documents in the names of Aleksandr Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov.

The names match those of suspects in the poisonings of former Russian intelligence agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury, England, in 2018. Both Skripals survived the attack carried out using the banned Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok.



Russia has denied any involvement in the poisonings.



An investigation by Bellingcat later identified the suspects as Aleksandr Mishkin and Anatoly Chepiga.

Hamacek said the situation would significantly harm Czech-Russian relations, saying, ""We’re in a similar situation like Britain in the attempted poisoning case in Salisbury.”

A representative of the Russian Embassy in Prague confirmed to Interfax that it had been informed of the expulsions and that Russian Ambassador Aleksandr Zmeyevsky had been summoned to the Czech Foreign Ministry.

Moscow warned about consequences in a response to the expulsions from the Russian Foreign Ministry.



""Prague is well aware of what comes after such hocus-pocus,"" spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said, according to Interfax.



Vladimir Japarov, first deputy chairman of the Federation Council’s International Affairs Committee, told the state news agency TASS that any reaction ""should be proportionate.""



Following Babis's announcement, the U.S. Embassy in Prague tweeted that “the United States stands with its steadfast ally, the Czech Republic. We appreciate their significant action to impose costs on Russia for its dangerous actions on Czech soil.”

India typically produces more than 60% of all vaccines sold globally, and is home to the Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's largest vaccine maker. Its vast manufacturing capability is why the country signed on as a major player in COVAX, the global vaccine-sharing initiative that provides discounted or free doses for lower-income countries. Under the initial agreement announced last year , SII would manufacture up to 200 million doses for up to 92 countries.

But the situation in India is markedly different from just a few months ago. Its second wave began in March, quickly surpassing the first, which had peaked last September at more than 97,000 coronavirus cases a day.

On Sunday, the country reported 261,500 new cases -- its highest single-day figure so far, according to data from the Indian Ministry of Health. India added a million new cases in less than a week, surpassing 14 million total cases on Thursday.

States and cities are imposing new restrictions, including weekend and nighttime curfews in the capital region Delhi, home to 19 million people. Migrant workers are also leaving major cities en masse for their home villages, afraid any potential lockdowns will leave them stranded.

And through it all, vaccine supplies have dried up on the ground, with at least five states reporting severe shortages and urging the federal government to act.

In the face of crisis, the government and SII have shifted focus from supplying vaccines to COVAX to prioritizing their own citizens at home.

""Deliveries of doses from the Serum Institute of India will be delayed in March and April,"" said COVAX, which is run by a coalition including international vaccine organization Gavi and the World Health Organization, in a news release on March 25 . ""Delays in securing supplies of SII-produced Covid-19 vaccine doses are due to the increased demand for Covid-19 vaccines in India.""

Boxes of the AstraZeneca vaccine, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and provided through the COVAX global initiative, arrive in Mogadishu, Somalia on March 15.

India had provided 28 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine so far, and was scheduled to deliver another 40 million doses in March and 50 million in April, the release said, adding that COVAX and the Indian government ""remain in discussions"" about completing supplies.

It's not the first time India had to pause its COVAX contributions: in January, the government restricted the export of AstraZeneca vaccines produced by SII ""because they want to prioritize for the most vulnerable and needy segments first,"" SII CEO Adar Poonawalla.

But these repeated delays have hit poor countries hard. The director of Africa's disease control body warned India's hold on exports could be ""catastrophic"" for the continent -- while Pakistan, one of the biggest program recipients, decided to allow private vaccine imports and sales to fill the gap.

Vaccination centers turning people away

India is administering two vaccines domestically: the Oxford-AstraZeneca one, also known as Covishield, and its homegrown Covaxin , developed jointly by Bharat Biotech and the government-run Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)

The country started its vaccination program in January for health care workers and priority groups, with the goal of fully inoculating 300 million people by August. But the program had a sluggish start, facing logistical issues as well as vaccine hesitancy among the population -- especially towards Covaxin, which was approved for emergency use before the efficacy data of its third phase trial were released.

To date, only 14.3 million people have been fully vaccinated -- just over 1% of India's population of 1.3 billion, according to Johns Hopkins University

But public confidence rose as the government stepped up an awareness campaign to assuage concerns, and the vaccination program picked up speed. As new daily cases accelerated in March and April, several states began reporting major vaccine shortages.

A vaccination center in Mumbai, India, that had to turn people away due to a shortage of vaccines on April 9.

In Odisha, nearly 700 vaccination centers had to close last week due to shortages, wrote health authorities in a letter to the central government, warning the state would soon exhaust its available stock.

Rajesh Bhaskar, a health official in Punjab, told CNN last week the state had about 450,000 doses of Covishield and 30,000 doses of Covaxin. The state is home to more than 27 million people, according to the government's latest available statistics . ""We want to vaccinate about 100,000 people per day at least, and the current supply is insufficient to meet that demand,"" he said.

Several districts in Maharashtra, the worst-hit state, had to temporarily suspend vaccination drives, including more than 70 centers in Mumbai that shut last week, according to the state's health minister, Rajesh Tope. Maharashtra had administered more than 11.1 million doses as of Thursday, the most of any Indian states, according to the Indian Ministry of Health.

""In both cities and villages, we have created teams ... to bring all those above 45 years old to take the vaccine,"" Tope said on April 7. ""People are coming to the centers, but our healthcare workers have to tell them that they haven't received the vaccine so they should go home.""

There are several challenges contributing to the shortages -- one being the supply of raw materials, said former ICMR director general Nirmal Kumar Ganguly.

India ""has the capacity to produce,"" Ganguly added, but supply chains have been disrupted during the pandemic. The vaccine formulas and required materials ""cannot be changed overnight, so we have to rely on the raw materials being imported.""

The US has placed a temporary ban on exporting raw materials critical for vaccine production -- and the EU has similarly tightened restrictions around vaccine exports. India is now working to ""adapt to the materials which are made at home or the neighboring countries like Singapore,"" but this will take time, said Ganguly.

An additional challenge is the country's reliance on SII, he added. There are other vaccine manufacturers in the country, such as Bharat Biotech, but SII remains the largest.

""The need has been glaringly brought out that we need to expand our capacity,"" Ganguly said. ""We are one of the vaccine exporters but these are done by two or three Indian companies at the moment, the rest of them are not big players and some of them are totally new in vaccine production.""

Government's mixed response

Several states have requested more doses from the central government -- but federal officials have pushed back, insisting the situation is under control.

Tope's complaints were ""nothing but an attempt to divert attention from Maharashtra government's repeated failures to control the spread of pandemic,"" said Indian Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in a statement last week. Home Minister Amit Shah also refuted states' claims, saying their information was ""not true"" and vaccines were available, ""as much as is required.""

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made a point of praising India's vaccination effort as a success. During a meeting with state governors on Wednesday, Modi ""highlighted that India has become the fastest nation to reach the landmark of 10 crore vaccinations (100 million doses),"" according to a statement from his office.

India took 85 days to reach 100 million doses. By comparison, the US took 89 days and China 102 days, according to Modi's office.

And on Tuesday, Rajesh Bhushan, the health ministry's secretary, said the problem was poor planning and management -- not supply. ""We are making doses available to states in a timely manner,"" he said, adding that states should ""look at how many unutilized doses there are at each cold chain point.""

Their statements were met with outrage from local and state leaders. Shah's assertion was ""factually completely incorrect,"" tweeted Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on April 10.

And though a last-minute shipment from the central government had saved Uttarakhand from a complete shortage, it's far from a perfect solution and ""the supply is unpredictable,"" said health department official Kuldeep Martolia on Monday.

Boxes of AstraZeneca vaccine, produced by the Serum Institute of India and donated by the Indian government, arrive in Kabul, Afghanistan, on February 7, 2021.

In a sign the federal government may be feeling the pressure, it took action this week to open the doors for vaccine imports. On Tuesday, it announced it would fast-track emergency approvals for vaccines already approved by the World Health Organization or authorities in the United States, Europe, Britain and Japan.

Companies still need to apply for approval in India, but they will be exempt from having to conduct local safety trials, expediting the process.

""If any of these regulators have approved a vaccine, the vaccine is now ready to be brought into the country for use, manufacture and fill-and-finish,"" Dr. VK Paul, a senior health official at the government-run think tank Niti Aayog, said at a news conference on Tuesday. ""We hope and we invite the vaccine makers such as Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and others ... to be ready to come to India as early as possible.""

The move is ""a calculated step"" by the government to ""ensure we have more vaccines available,"" said Ganguly. The government could also expand its supply through the private market -- but this brings additional challenges too, he said, including the question of how to price vaccines to provide equitable access to the poor.

But even the possibility of importing foreign vaccines won't be a quick fix, since companies like Pfizer and Moderna have other orders to fulfill first, including supplying vaccines for the US. India just granted emergency use authorization for Russia's Sputnik vaccine -- but ""by the time they build up manufacturing capacities and manufacturing requirements, it will be five to six months,"" Ganguly said.

In the meantime, the government is working to expand local production capacity -- a state-run biomedical institute in Maharashtra was given the green light to manufacture the Covaxin vaccine on Thursday, through a transfer of technology with Bharat Biotech.

All the while, the second wave roils on, with cases climbing sharply every day. Millions of people are traveling across the country to the city of Haridwar in Uttarakhand for the Kumbh Mela , a Hindu festival and the largest pilgrimage on Earth. Despite warnings of the Covid risks, huge crowds are gathering to hold prayers, attend ceremonies and take holy dips in the Ganges River.

Already, cases in Haridwar are spiking -- prompting the state to impose new restrictions on Thursday. At least one religious group attending the festival, the Niranjani Akhada, has asked those from out of state to pull back amid the rise in cases.

""This surge is a very, very threatening sight which is happening at this given moment in India,"" said Ganguly. ""We have never seen anything like this before.""",1840,11408,15,100

He said, however, that sanctions alone are not sufficient.

In an interview with ""Face The Nation"" moderator Margaret Brennan, Macron said he ""fully"" shares Mr. Biden's desire to open dialogue with Russia. However, he said it was important to be clear with Putin ""when we are not aligned.""

""This is the only way to be credible. I think that sanctions are not sufficient in itself, in themselves, but sanctions are part of the package. I do prefer constructive dialogue, but to have a constructive and efficient dialogue, you need credibility,"" Macron said.

Over 30,000 Russian soldiers are amassed on the border of Ukraine, raising concerns that Russia may invade. This is the highest number of Russian troops gathered on the border since 2014. Macron is aligned with President Biden's view that this is an unacceptable level of tension.

""I think we have to define clear red lines with Russia,"" in order to be credible, Macron said. He acknowledged that the international community has had what he called a ""naive approach"" with Russia.

""I think what happened a few years ago when Ukraine was invaded, it's not a failure of diplomacy, it's a failure of our collective credibility vis-à-vis Russia,"" Macron said in reference to the international community's failure to enforce the Obama-Biden administration's ""red line"" on the use of chemical weapons by Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad in 2013. That inaction, in Macron's view, emboldened Mr. Putin.

Months later, Russia annexed Crimea, a peninsula jutting out into the Black Sea, away from Ukraine in 2014. The annexation was widely condemned by the international community, and the U.S. sanctioned Russia in response.

On Thursday, Mr. Biden announced more sanctions against Russia this week in retaliation for espionage and political interference, citing both the SolarWinds cyber hacking and Moscow's interference in the 2020 US presidential election.

""We cannot allow a foreign power to interfere in our democratic process with impunity,"" Mr. Biden said in remarks announcing the sanctions on Thursday, although he added that ""now is the time to de-escalate.""

According to a White House readout of their Tuesday phone call, President Biden also called on Vladimir Putin to ""de-escalate tensions"" surrounding the Russian military buildup in ""occupied Crimea and on Ukraine's borders.""

To some, he is a bright-eyed, relentlessly intelligent and academically competent Young Turk, who has found his way into the topmost level of Nigeria's government at the relatively young age of 48.

To others, he is a symbol of how deeply held and unapologetically public religious faith can coexist and interoperates with modernity and cosmopolitanism without contradiction.

Isa Pantami

His Twitter handle proudly displays his impressive academic credentials side-by-side with his proud elementary educational background at an Islamic Tsangaya (non-Hausa readers might be more familiar with the term 'Almajiri').

Despite his impressive credentials and his reportedly genial personality which have endeared him to many however, several whispers and rumours about an allegedly dark past have continuously swirled around him at every point in his 5 year-old career as a public servant. From his 2016 appointment as DG/CEO at the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), through to his appointment as a cabinet minister in 2019, these rumours have refused to go away.

Today for the first time ever, we can authoritatively lift the veil on Dr. Ali Isa Ibrahim Pantami and establish his strong and indisputable connections to - and deeply held sympathies for - the dark world of Salafist Islamic terrorism. It is a story that starts in Pantami Ward in Gombe State; meanders through extreme controversy at Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University in Bauchi State; takes a notable detour through a Saudi Arabian university known as a global hotbed for Salafist terror recruitment; and eventually ends with a known terror sympathiser and ideological 'gradualist' sitting in Nigeria's federal cabinet.

Pantami's Educational Controversies

Variously known as ""Dr Isa Pantami,"" ""Sheikh Ali Ibrahim,"" and ""Shaykh Isa Ali Pantami"" he has the unique distinction of being one of the very few people to achieve very high levels of academic achievement in both Western and Islamic education. Following a non-standard education path that included 4 years at a Tsangaya and 2 years of independent Islamic study after primary and secondary school, Pantami gained admission to the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University (ATBU) in the late 1990s where he studied Computer Science. He graduated with a BTech in 2003, followed by an Msc in 2008 and this is where the story gets interesting.

His official Twitter handle includes a bio link to his Wikipedia page, which is poorly referenced and light on detail. On further examination of the sources attributed on his Wikipedia page, it becomes evident that much of what is written there was in fact lifted word-for-word from an official government press release sent out to the media.

Isa Pantami's page on Wikipedia

Source article from PM News

Both straightforward accounts of his educational career make no mention of any controversy during his academic career. Keep this in mind for later. While digging into his academic qualifications, I was able to confirm that he did in fact obtain a PhD in 2014 from Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen. His impressive PhD thesis is linked here. It was impossible to verify his claims of attending Harvard, MIT, IMD Loussaune and Oxford university independently, although the nature of short certificate programs makes it necessary to extend the benefit of the doubt. We can assume these claims are all true.

The neat cover story starts to fall apart however, when a reference from a U.S. diplomatic cable leaked in 2009 by Wikileaks suggests that in his prior iteration as an academic at ATBU, Pantami was in fact a radical extremist cleric whose views were so repulsive that he was kicked out of the university and from a mosque in his native Gombe State.

It gets more interesting.

Where his personally-approved Wikipedia profile makes no mention of a stint in Saudi Arabia or what happened there, a bit of digging turns up information that significantly changes the clean-cut picture he is eager to present. According to multiple verifiable online and offline sources, Isa Pantami in fact spent a number of years learning and lecturing at the University of Medina in Saudi Arabia.

Isa Ali Pantami Profile on IslamicMarkets.com

This information is very important for two reasons. First, the Islamic University of Medina (IUM) is globally recognised as a hotspot for Salafist Islamic terror recruitment. While it does not itself teach or openly condone terror, it is the undisputed global headquarters of Salafist fundamentalism. The below excerpts from a UK Guardian article from 2001 illustrates how IUM serves as a recruitment pipeline that feeds extremist groups like the Taliban and Al-Qaeda.

The second reason that we should be very interested in Pantami's undisclosed sojourn within the world of Islamic education is that according to multiple sources, he studied the teachings of hardline Salafist scholars including Sheikh Muhammad Saleh Al-Uthaymeen. For those who do not know Sheikh Al-Uthaymeen, here is a collection of quotes and fatwas issued by the man described as a ""Giant of the Salafi movement.""

Source: Al Araby

Source: IBI Times

Source: UK Independent

Sheikh Al-Uthaymeen says that peace between Muslims and non-Muslims can only be temporary because ""jihad is the highest form of islam.""

A transcription of the video above goes as follows:

“If someone was to say; is a treaty permissible between us and the Mushrikeen (variously translated as disbelievers/idolaters/atheists), so that we don’t fight them and they don’t fight us? The answer is yes. If we need this, then it is allowed. For instance if the Muslims are in a state of weakness and they are not capable of fighting the enemy. So there is nothing wrong with carrying out a treaty between us and them. However, would the treaty have to be restricted to a limited time period or not?

We say the treaty is of three types: The first type is the restricted treaty meaning that we (the Muslims) say to the disbelievers, “Between us and you is ten years, or five years or eight years (of the treaty).”[…]The second type is the endless treaty which stipulates that we never attack. This is prohibited and I think it is by consensus because this necessitates abolishment of Jihad, and Jihad is the peak of Islam. There will be no power for a nation except by way of Jihad, if it is capable of this.”

For good measure, Sheikh Al-Uthaymeen also specified that his definition of 'Mushikreen' (disbelievers/people without God) also includes Christians and Jews.

Just a Series of Coincidences?

So far, we have established that Isa Pantami has a side to his past educational pursuits that most people are not aware of. However, it is tempting to dismiss these links to Salafist terror and extremism as merely circumstantial. Apart from what is essentially gossip from a Wikileaks cable, the documented views of the teachers he studied with, and the well-earned teror-recruitment-hotspot reputation of the Islamic University of Medina where he taught, there is no actual evidence so far to suggest that Isa Pantami himself is an extremist. Right?

He himself has tried to present himself as the unfortunate victim of such circumstances beyond his control. Commenting on a recent viral video that depicted him in debate with Boko Haram founder Mohammed Yusuf, he claimed that he was in fact a moderate Islamic scholar taking on the self-imposed and heroic task of de-radicalising Salafist extremists using his superior Islamic education and his ability to debate.

https://twitter.com/DrIsaPantami/status/1381584099010347012

He is apparently the victim of bigotry perpetrated by people who do not understand Hausa or context. How on earth could a STEM PhD holder with academic achievements spanning Harvard, MIT, Oxford and Cambridge be a lowkey Islamic extremist and terror apologist? What a ridiculous thought.

Or is it?

Cross Section of Isa Pantami's ""Suwaye Yan Taliban"" (""Who Are The Taliban?"") Public Lecture

In his prior iteration as Imam Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, our hero has been accused of making several incendiary utterances and expressing support for violent jihadists around the world. With the exception of a Wikileaks cable, there has been precious little to substantiate these claims. Until now.

For the first time, readers can listen to Imam Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami in his own words expressing deep support and admiration for Osama bin-Laden and the Afghan Taliban, even praying ""May God help us to imitate their good."" The following recording is from a public lecture Pantami delivered on September 12, 2006 in Bauchi State, titled ""Suwaye Yan Taliban"" (""Who Are The Taliban""). The recording is also freely available on the Nigerian Islamic community website DawahNigeria.com.

The following translation was made by Andrea Brigaglia PhD, Director of the Centre for Contemporary Islam at the University of Cape Town, South Africa. It can be found in her 2019 paper ""Debating Boko Haram.""

""

Osama Bin Laden is mentioned in various instances in this section, with his name always followed by the formula haẓahu ’Llāh (may God preserve him). At the same time, however, the government of Saudi Arabia is also the object of unreserved praises, being described as “our qibla” and “the original abode of faith.” The author mentions the Saudi and Pakistani involvement in the Afghani conflict as starting only after the end of the Afghani war, in a section titled “the post-Soviet era.” It was the leadership of the Arab mujāhidīn, Pantami continues, who invited Muslim countries such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan to be involved in the post-war peace agreement, and not Saudi Arabia and Pakistan who, in coordination with the United States, had funded the mujāhidīn for years.

References are made to a meeting held between all the leaders of the Afghani factions in Medina, with quotes from a book authored by the Saudi scholar Mūsā al-Qarnī, who is one of Pantami’s main sources (and who would later, in 2011, be handed a 20-year prison term by the Saudi government). Similarly, the anarchy that followed the end of the anti-Soviet war in Afghanistan is not attributed by Pantami to the contrasting agendas of the various political actors involved (the Afghani factions, the US, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the Arab foreign fighters), but to the “divide and rule” policy of the kuffār (unbelievers).

[Pantami then says that] it was in response to this anarchy that “the Commander of the Believers, Mullah Mohammad Omar, may God preserve him,” entered the scene. The formation of the Taliban, on 1st Muharram 1415, corresponding to 24 June 1994, is reconstructed through accurate historical detail fused with some hagiographic data: the 313 scholars who first established the Taliban, for example, correspond to the 313 companions who fought the Battle of Badr (624) alongside the Prophet. The ultimate goal of the Taliban was to bring peace and reconciliation in Afghanistan by “establishing an Islamic leadership, a Caliphate and the Sharia, as every Muslim is commanded to do.”

Here Pantami relies not only on the book by al-Qarnī but also on ‘The Rise of the Taliban’ and on a book by the Nigerian Salisu Shehu, ‘Who are the Talibans’. Pantami [says] that the Taliban are not immune from error. His particular concern is that “about 5% of them” have a penchant for Sufism, which obviously is, in his eyes, an imperfection in their credentials. The remaining 95%, however, are rooted in the “purest Sunni doctrine” (tataccen aƙidar Sunna): “they are people raised in the religious way, may God enable us to imitate their good” mutane masu tarbiya ta addini, Allah ya ba mu ikon koyi da alheransu). In particular, Pantami says that the Taliban are to be praised and imitated in three respects.

The first is the destruction of the two “idols of the Buddha” at Bamiyan. In imitating them, the Nigerian Muslims should long for the day in which every “idolatrous image” will be erased from the Nigerian currency, and no picture will be used on passports and electoral posters, for photos and images are contrary to the Sharia. The second is their effort to impose a strict adherence to the Sunna in the dress code of Afghani women (full face-veiling) and men (st-long beard and trousers cut at the length of the ankle). The third is the protection offered to Osama Bin Laden after the Americans rushed to accuse him of being responsible for the events of 9/11, by arguing that not only was there insufcient proof of his involvement, but also that “even if he had done it, according to the Sharia he should not be handed to you.”

The section concludes with a quote from Safar al-Hawali which is also a favourite scare-quote in the reservoir of contemporary islamophobes, according to which “hating America is part of our creed.” This is followed by prayers for the success of the Taliban; new comparisons between the Taliban and the Prophet’s Companions; and prayers for Bin Baz, al-Albani, Ibn al-‘Uthayimin and Azzam. Finally, there is an invitation to learn from the Taliban’s experience by studying hard “medicine and engineering” while patiently preparing for the moment when Nigeria will be ripe for a leader of the stature of Mullah Omar.

The first questioner asks how one should respond to those Salafis who reject Osama Bin Laden because of his killing of innocent unbelievers; this is probably a reference to the quietist and Saudi-loyalist strand of Salafi thought in Nigeria, represented by scholars such as Muhammad Sani Umar Rijiyar Lemo.

Pantami responded to the questioner by saying that yes, these scholars have some truth, for Bin Laden is liable to make mistakes, but “I still consider him as a better Muslim than myself.” “We are all happy whenever unbelievers are being killed,” continued Pantami, “but the Sharia does not allow us to kill them without a reason.” “Our zeal (hamasa) should not take precedence over our obedience to the sacred law.”

The second questioner asks how a jihad could take place in Nigeria when there is no consensus over a leader, in contrast to the consensus that (if one has to believe to the lecture) existed in Afghanistan around the gure of Mullah Omar. Pantami answers that this was precisely the goal of his lecture; in other words, to point out the need to establish in Nigeria an overall Islamic leadership similar to Mullah Omar’s, before moving to the next step.

In Nigeria, continued Pantami (emphasis added), this is the time for correction (gyara) and preparation (isti‘dād): “How can you start a jihad,when your father is still going around without a beard? When your mother is still going around with a mere transparent veil (gyale) rather than with a full-length hijab?

“Any effort to start a jihad without having established correct Islamic practices is doomed to failure, and this is precisely the main lesson to draw from the Afghan Taliban, whose success was established upon their unwavering attachment to the Sunna. This is the reason, concludes Pantami with a new reference to the “Kanamma affair” and to his critical engagement with Yusuf, why “any attempt to start a struggle that you have seen me rejecting so far, [it was because] it was not led by scholars and there was no understanding of the Sunna.” Thus the second question, focused on the possible implementation of jihad in Nigeria, was answered with a call for postponement (irjā’, Yusuf would say).

The third questioner asks how to make sense of the alliance between Saudi Arabia and the western countries fighting Al-Qaeda, such as the United Kingdom and the United States. Unfortunately, the recording stops before one can listen to Pantami’s answer.

Isa Pantami - A Jihadi Gradualist in Sheep's Clothing

According to a 2017 paper published by the US Institute of Peace and the Wilson Centre, Al Qaeda's jihadi tactics have morphed over the years from ""shock and awe"" events like September 11 to a strategy known as ""gradualism."" Explaining the subtle difference between open terrorism and gradualist terrorism, the paper says:

""ISIS is a political extremist actor, while al-Qaeda has become an extremist political actor. In other words, ISIS is more of an extremist movement with political goals. ISIS is unwilling to compromise; its behaviour is unlikely to change whatever the incentives. In contrast, al-Qaeda is now more of a political organisation with extremist beliefs, although that does not mean it can be co-opted. Both ISIS and al-Qaeda have long-term strategies to create a Salafist utopia. ISIS's core strategy is to pursue a Salafi state through continuous confrontations both within Muslim-dominated countries and outside them. ISIS believes muslims can be held to an interpretation of Sharia today.

[…] Al-Qaeda's strategy is more gradualist. It believes that Muslims must be educated first on Sharia, that the idea of jihad must be popularised, and that Muslims must be convinced to take up arms as the only method of emancipation. It is less exclusionary. It has forged alliances and quietly entrenched itself and its ideas within local communities with the aim of eventually building a pure salafi one.""

The irrefutable evidence of Isa Pantami's own pronouncements, hitherto hidden behind what he considered to be the veil of the Hausa and Arabic language tells a very clear story about exactly who Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami is, and what his existential goals are. It is no longer a conspiracy theory. There is now hard evidence.

At this point, the only course of action left is for President Muhammadu Buhari to quickly and unceremoniously fire Dr Pantami from his sensitive job where he sits on the National Executive Council and has access to the personal data of tens of millions of Nigerians. Nigeria can definitely do better than have an openly self-proclaimed Al-Qaeda sympathiser as its Minister of Communications and Digital Economy.

“We cannot allow a foreign power to interfere in our democratic process with impunity,” Biden said in remarks delivered in the East Room of the White House.

On Thursday morning, the president signed an executive order that imposed a range of new sanctions and the expulsion of diplomats. The sanctions allow the U.S. government to block bond transactions between U.S. institutions and Russian banks; the order reserves the right for the U.S. to expand these sovereign debt sanctions.

In his remarks from the White House, Biden said he had warned Putin repeatedly in the past several months that there would be consequences for Russia’s meddling in U.S. elections, the SolarWinds data breach of U.S. government computers and its continued aggression in Crimea.

In a call with Putin on Wednesday, Biden said, he informed the Russian president of the new sanctions but also stressed that he had sought to deliver a “proportionate” response to them.

“I was clear with President Putin that we could have gone further. But I chose not to do so. I chose to be proportionate,” Biden said. “The United States is not looking to kick off a cycle of escalation and conflict with Russia. We want a stable, predictable relationship.”

Biden added that further retaliatory action against Russia was not off the table.

“If Russia continues to interfere with our democracy, I’m prepared to take further actions to respond,” he said.

As part of the Biden administration’s retaliatory actions, the Treasury Department unveiled sanctions against 32 entities and individuals on Thursday. The White House, meanwhile, expelled 10 Russian diplomats from Washington.

In a show of support for the new sanctions, foreign ministers from the other G-7 nations — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the U.K. — joined the U.S. in a statement issued Thursday.

""We call on Russia to cease its provocations and to immediately de-escalate tensions in line with its international obligations,"" the statement said.

While Biden said he was firm with Putin during Wednesday’s call, he also stressed that the two leaders should continue to speak one on one and proposed that they hold a summit in the coming months.

“I expressed my belief that communication between the two of us, personally and directly, was to be essential in moving forward to a more effective relationship, and he agreed on that point,” Biden said. “To that end, I proposed that we meet in person this summer in Europe for a summit to address a range of issues facing both of our countries.”

Kremlin and White House readouts of Wednesday’s phone call between the two men make no mention of conversations about jailed Putin opposition leader Alexei Navalny.

Asked about the omission Wednesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that “the health, the safety of Alexei Navalny is raised frequently and through many channels.”

In a March interview with ABC News, Biden was asked whether he thought Putin was a “killer.”

“I do,” he replied, a response that drew a sharp rebuke from Russia, which also promptly recalled its ambassador to Washington.

On Thursday, Biden’s tone was far less critical, as he repeatedly highlighted the potential in an ongoing partnership with Russia.

“The way forward is through thoughtful dialogue and the diplomatic process,” he said.

As yet, there has been no formal response from the Kremlin regarding Biden’s proposal for a summit.

Biden seemed optimistic about the prospect for good relations between the U.S. and Russia, but made sure to underscore that he will not be bullied or allow himself to be taken advantage of by Putin.

“My bottom line is this: When there is interest to work with Russia, we should and we will,” Biden said. “And when Russia seeks to violate the interests of the United States, we will respond.”

The achievement was confirmed by the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Ali Akbar Salehi. The official said the 60% uranium enrichment process was “underway at the Martyr Ahmadi Roshan nuclear facility,” referring to the Natanz plant.

“We are producing about nine grams of 60% enriched uranium an hour,” Salehi said. “But we have to work on arrangements to drop it to five grams per hour.”

“60% enrichment is an answer to your evilness,” Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani has said, as he promised to “cut both hands” of Iran’s enemies with the sharp enrichment hike.

The Natanz facility suffered a major power outage last Sunday, which resulted in damage to a number of uranium-enriching centrifuges. Tehran has promised to replace the damaged equipment, as well as to install additional devices at the facility in the aftermath of the suspected attack, which it blamed squarely on Israel. While Israeli involvement in the incident was reported by multiple US and Israeli outlets, Tel Aviv has remained silent on the matter.

The incident came amid talks in Vienna that had been attempting to revive the long-comatose 2015 nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The deal effectively fell apart after then-US President Donald Trump pulled out in early 2018, accusing Tehran of violating its “spirit.” Since then, Washington has imposed numerous sanctions on Tehran, and Iran has gradually expanded its nuclear activities.

While Tehran accused its alleged attackers of trying to undermine its negotiating position via the sabotage at Natanz, European signatories to the JCPOA were more alarmed at the 60% enrichment move.

“This is a serious development, since the production of highly enriched uranium constitutes an important step in the production of a nuclear weapon. Iran has no credible civilian need for enrichment at this level,” the UK, Germany, and France said in a joint statement on Wednesday.

Tehran dismissed such concerns, reiterating that its nuclear program pursues only civilian and peaceful goals. “We could have done 60% [enrichment] before. Today, we can do 90% enrichment if we want to, but we are not seeking a nuclear bomb,” Rouhani said on Thursday.

There are tens of thousands of pieces of evidence included in Ms Maxwell's trial, and the new release of 2,100 photos will only add to the mountain of evidence the alleged sex trafficker's lawyers will have to pour over before she goes to trial.

Ms Maxwell's lawyer sent a letter to Judge Alison Nathan requesting more time to review the materials.

The trial is set to begin on 12 July.

Ms Maxwell was hit with two additional charges of sex trafficking late last month after a new accuser levied claims against her. As a result, Ms Maxwell's lawyers have asked to ""re-review"" the existing evidence to consider the latest charges.

The latest accuser, a woman who is now in her 30's, alleged that Ms Maxwell recruited her to send sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein nude ""sexualised messages"" to his home in Palm Beach between 2001 and 2004. She also claimed that Ms Maxwell groomed her to engage in sex acts with Epstein.

According to the indictment discussing her accusations, “Maxwell asked Minor Victim-4 about her family and other aspects of her life. Maxwell also sought to normalize inappropriate and abusive conduct by, among other things, discussing sexual topics in front of Minor Victim-4 and being present when Minor Victim- 4 was nude in the massage room of the Palm Beach Residence.”

The accuser would have been between the ages of 14 and 17 at the time she was involved with Epstein.

“We cannot adequately prepare for a trial containing the new charges and a substantially expanded conspiracy in the less than three months remaining,” the lawyers said in their letter.

Ms Maxwell's lawyers also claimed that technology issues were hindering her ability to review the evidence herself.

“We have tried to use an FBI-supplied laptop and hard drive to review approximately 2,100 ‘Highly Confidential’ photographs that were not produced to us in discovery,” the lawyers wrote in the letter. “Because of technical issues with the laptop, we still have not completed the review.”

Thus far, a ruling to change the date of the trial has not been made.

A doctor at the Albert Schweitzer municipal hospital in Rio de Janeiro said that doctors are resorting to tying patients to their beds in order to ventilate them.

Medics have also been diluting sedative medication to make it last longer and using neuromuscular blockers so patients can't resist, they said on the condition of anonymity.

Brazil has become the epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic, with daily deaths averaging around 3,000 a day and oxygen supplies for intensive care patients at breaking point.

On Thursday, the country reported 3,560 COVID-19 fatalities and 73,174 new cases.

Describing the situation at the hospital in Rio, the doctor said: ""You relax the muscles and do the procedure easily, but we don't have sedation. Some try to talk, resist. They're conscious.""

Brazilian newspaper O Globo reported on Thursday that other hospitals in the Rio metropolitan region were experiencing similar issues, with patients' relatives desperately calling other medical facilities in search of sedatives.

A spokesperson for Rio de Janeiro's health secretariat said ""occasional"" shortages at the Albert Schweitzer hospital are being caused by difficulties obtaining supplies on the global market.

They said that ""substitutions are made so that there is no damage to the assistance provided"" to patients.

The spokesperson did not comment on claims patients are being tied to their beds.

In Sao Paulo, state health secretary Jean Carlo Gorinchteyn said at a news briefing on Wednesday that 640 hospitals there were on the verge of collapse.

He said medicine shortages are possible within days and the need for medical supplies is urgent.

""This is not a necessity for Sao Paulo; it is a necessity for the whole country,"" he told reporters.

Nine requests for intubation medication have been made by his health ministry over the past 40 days, he added.

The last delivery of supplies only covered 6% of what was needed that month in Sao Paulo, state officials said.

Federal health minister Marcelo Queiroga said on Wednesday that a shipment of sedatives was due to arrive within the next 10 days following a deal with the Pan American Health Organisation.

An order of 3.4 million doses of intubation drugs - enough to treat 500 patients for six weeks - has also been ordered from private sector firms, officials added.

The first batch of 2.3 million doses was due to arrive in Brazil from China on Thursday.

The French embassy in Islamabad on Thursday advised all French nationals in Pakistan to temporarily leave the country after violent protests by a radical religious group that has now been banned by the government.

The Tehreek-i-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) took to streets on Monday to launch violent protests to force the government to expel the French ambassador over blasphemous caricatures published last year.

Though no French citizen was reportedly targeted so far but the embassy has urged all the French citizens to leave Pakistan, apparently as a precautionary measure.

“Due to the serious threats to French interests in Pakistan, French nationals and French companies are advised to temporarily leave the country,” the embassy said in an email message to its citizens in Pakistan.

It said that the departures will be carried out by existing commercial airlines.

Interior minister Sheikh Rashid announced on Wednesday to ban the TLP and officials said that Prime Minister Imran Khan and his cabinet endorsed the summary by the interior ministry to outlaw the group.

The trouble began after police arrested the TLP chief Saad Rizvi on Monday ahead of the April 20 deadline by the group to expel the French ambassador.

The issue of expulsion of the ambassador was linked to an agreement between the TLP and the government when the former in November last year postponed its protest against publication of blasphemous cartoons.

Initially, the government had agreed that it would take action to fulfill the demand of expulsion of the French ambassador by February but later on the two sides agreed to set April 20 as the new deadline.

However, when Rizvi was arrested the TLP in coordinated protests blocked main roads in all major cities and the protests turned violent when police tried to remove them.

After efforts of more than two days, the government has succeeded to clear the roads and restore traffic but French embassy issued an advisory for its citizens. Speaking to Dawn.com, the embassy’s press attache Veronique Wagner, said “We can confirm that we have sent a precautionary note to all our citizens in Pakistan advising them to temporarily leave the country if possible due to the recent protests that have caused graver security threats and put its citizens at risk.” She added, however, that the embassy has not been closed but was working with limited staff.",415,2573,16,105

BAZ RATNER/Reuters

The young mother was trying to get home with food for her two children when she says soldiers pulled her off a minibus in Ethiopia’s Tigray region, claiming it was overloaded.

It was the beginning of an 11-day ordeal in February, during which she says she was repeatedly raped by 23 soldiers who forced nails, a rock and other items into her vagina, and threatened her with a knife.

Doctors showed Reuters the bloodstained stone and two 3-inch nails they said they had removed from her body.

The woman, 27, is among hundreds who have reported that they were subjected to horrific sexual violence by Ethiopian and allied Eritrean soldiers after fighting broke out in November in the mountainous northern region of Ethiopia, doctors said.

Some women were held captive for extended periods, days or weeks at a time, said Dr. Fasika Amdeselassie, the top public health official for the government-appointed interim administration in Tigray.

“Women are being kept in sexual slavery,” Fasika told Reuters. “The perpetrators have to be investigated.”

Reports of rape have been circulating for months. But Fasika’s assertion, based on women’s accounts, marks the first time an Ethiopian official – in this case, a top regional health officer – has made a sexual slavery accusation in connection with the conflict in Tigray.

In addition, eight other doctors at five public hospitals told Reuters that most of the rape victims described their attackers as either Ethiopian government soldiers or Eritrean troops. It was more common for women to report sexual violence by Eritrean soldiers, the doctors said.

The Eritreans have been helping Ethiopia’s central government fight the region’s former ruling party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), in the conflict plaguing the Horn of Africa nation.

Canada joins G7 in condemning Ethiopia violence, calling for humanitarian aid

Taken together, the descriptions paint the most detailed picture to date of the sexual violence against women in Tigray and the military’s alleged involvement in it.

Most people interviewed for this article declined to be identified. They said they feared reprisals, including possible violence, by soldiers who guard the hospitals and towns.

Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed acknowledged in a speech to parliament on March 23 that “atrocities were being committed by raping women” and promised that the perpetrators would be punished. He did not identify the alleged perpetrators.

He said then for the first time that Eritrean soldiers had entered the conflict in Tigray in support of the Ethiopian government after the TPLF attacked military bases across the region in the early hours of Nov. 4. Ethiopia’s government had previously denied this, and the Eritrean government still does not acknowledge their troops’ presence. The TPLF was the dominant power in the central government when Eritrea fought a bloody border war with Ethiopia a generation ago.

Neither the Ethiopian nor the Eritrean governments responded to Reuters’ questions about specific cases raised by women and their doctors, or about the accusation of sexual slavery. No charges have been announced by civilian or military prosecutors against any soldiers. However, officials in both countries emphasized that their governments have zero tolerance for sexual violence – a point Abiy’s spokeswoman, Billene Seyoum, said the prime minister reiterated recently in discussions with military leaders.

The alleged sexual violence has drawn international attention.

Billene said the United Nations, the African Union and Ethiopia’s state-appointed human rights commission have been authorized to carry out joint investigations into alleged abuses by all sides in the conflict. That includes the “criminal clique,” she said, referring to the TPLF.

An Ethiopian military spokesman and the head of a government task force on the Tigray crisis did not respond to phone calls and text messages seeking comment. Reuters could not reach military leaders in either country.

Asked about the reports that Eritrean troops have committed rapes in Tigray and are keeping women in sexual slavery, the country’s information minister, Yemane Gebremeskel, accused TPLF activists of “coaching ‘sympathizers’ to create false testimonies.”

“All the fabricated stories – which are alien to our culture and laws – are peddled to cover up the crimes of the TPLF which started the war,” he told Reuters in a written response.

Reuters was unable to reach a TPLF spokesman.

RECORDS OF ABUSE

Fasika, the health official, said at least 829 cases of sexual assault have been reported at the five hospitals since the conflict in Tigray began.

Those cases were likely “the tip of the iceberg,” Fasika said. Rape is under-reported in Ethiopia because it carries a huge stigma. Also, most of the region’s health facilities are no longer functioning, and travel between towns remains dangerous, he said.

Story continues below advertisement

Most of the women who have come forward are either pregnant or sustained severe physical injury from the rapes, Fasika said.

Reuters interviewed 11 women who said they had been raped by soldiers from Eritrea, Ethiopia or both. Four said they were kidnapped, taken to military camps and gang raped, in some cases alongside other women. The women did not know the camp names but said they were located near Mekelle and the towns of Idaga Hamus, Wukro and Sheraro.

Five other women said they were held in fields or deserted houses for up to six days. And two said they were raped in their own homes.

Reuters could not independently verify their accounts. However, all told similar stories of being beaten and brutalized. Healthcare providers confirmed that the 11 women’s injuries were consistent with the events they described, and they showed Reuters medical records for three of the women detailing their conditions.

The health care providers also shared details of nine other cases of sexual assault, including the ordeals of two 14-year-old girls.

Although Ethiopia’s government declared victory over the TPLF in November, fighting continues in some areas, and medical workers say new rapes are reported at the region’s health facilities every day.

“This is being done to dishonour the women, to break their pride,” said a doctor at Ayder Referral Hospital, in Mekelle, citing the brutality of the attacks and humiliation of victims. “This is not for sexual gratification. The rapes are to punish Tigray.”

‘TELL MY STORY’

The 27-year-old mother said uniformed soldiers from Eritrea pulled her off a minibus on the road from Mekelle to the city of Adigrat on Feb. 6. They tied her up and marched her through fields to a bush camp, she said. After 11 days of rapes and beatings, she said, the soldiers forced nails, cotton, plastic bags and a rock into her vagina and left her alone in the bush.

Villagers found her unconscious and brought her to a nearby hospital.

She said she was still bleeding from severe internal injuries and could not control her urine, walk without a crutch or sit up for long periods. One leg was broken, she said.

She also described a different kind of pain: While in the hospital, she has no way to speak to her 4-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter because the Eritrean soldiers took her cellphone. She had left the children with her mother to search for food and never returned. At the time, the family had less than a week’s worth of bread.

“I don’t know anything, if they are dead or alive,” she said. “The enemy destroyed my life.”

A 32-year-old mother in Mekelle told Reuters that soldiers removed her from a minibus on the same road at the end of February. They were dressed in Ethiopian uniforms, she said, but spoke with an Eritrean accent and had traditional facial scarification typical of the neighbouring country. She said they shot her 12-year-old son dead in front of her, then brought her to a camp where she was held with other female captives and repeatedly raped for 10 days.

“Tell my story,” she said. “This is happening to women out there right now. I want this to end with me.”

A 28-year-old house cleaner said soldiers grabbed her from a street in Mekelle on the afternoon of Feb. 10 and took her to a field outside a military base where she was raped by more than 10 men wearing Ethiopian or Eritrean uniforms.

Wiping away tears, she said that during her two-week ordeal, soldiers doused her with alcohol and mocked her as they assaulted her. She escaped when her captors were distracted by gunfire, she said.

SHOT FOR RESISTING

The government has set up a task force separate from the human rights commission to investigate the reports of sexual violence. Its head, Mebrihit Assefa, said the body includes representatives from the regional health bureau, the attorney general’s office and federal police.

The task force plans to set up five centres where rape survivors can file reports with law enforcement and receive medical and psychosocial support.

“Our prosecutors (and) police officers are there to investigate all crimes committed, including sexual violence,” said Awol Sultan, a spokesman for the attorney general’s office.

He did not respond to questions about the women alleging they were raped during captivity, or whether prosecutors were in touch with either the Eritrean or Ethiopian militaries. The results of the criminal investigations will be released publicly at an unspecified date, he said.

Abera Nigus, the head of Tigray’s justice bureau, said the legal process was likely to be complicated because most courts are not functioning in Tigray, and many rape victims cannot identify their assailants.

Knowing their rapists are still at large also has discouraged women from seeking help, doctors said.

Many of the women who sought treatment at hospitals had vaginal and anal tears, sexually transmitted diseases and injuries that rendered them incontinent, said the Ayder hospital doctor, an obstetrician gynecologist. The doctor shared notes from 11 cases the hospital had treated involving women raped by soldiers.

One woman had been gang raped on three separate occasions, according to the hospital notes.

Another was five months pregnant when she was raped, the notes indicate. Two 14-year-old girls were sexually assaulted in front of their families. One girl had a hand and foot amputated.

She had been shot for resisting her assailant.

Eritrean forces have started withdrawing from the Tigray region in northern Ethiopia, the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said, following mounting reports blaming the Eritreans for human rights abuses including rape, looting and killings of civilians. Yahaira Jacquez reports. Reuters

0,New report: Federal government subsidies and financing for fossil fuels reached nearly $18 billion in 2020,https://environmentaldefence.ca/2021/04/15/new-report-federal-government-subsidies-financing-fossil-fuels-reached-nearly-18-billion-2020/,"For Immediate Release: April 15, 2021

In advance of the federal budget, a new report from Environmental Defence shows that the federal government and its agencies increased financial support for oil and gas companies as country grappled with COVID-19

Ottawa, Ont. – A new report released today by Environmental Defence reveals that despite a decade of promises to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, Canada’s federal government announced a minimum of almost $18 billion to the oil and gas sector in 2020. In contrast, the Government’s new climate plan commits $15 billion to climate initiatives – spread over ten years.

The report, Paying Polluters: Federal Financial Support to Oil and Gas in 2020, estimates federal supports either announced or provided in 2020, including COVID support programs. This includes $3.28 billion in direct spending and $13.6 billion in public financing, primarily through crown corporation Export Development Canada. However, the exact amount of financial support from the federal government is difficult to specify due to a lack of transparency and public reporting. As a result, the numbers included here are certainly an underestimate of total support.

“For too long, Canadian governments have been propping up the fossil fuel industry, using tax dollars to fill the coffers of oil and gas corporations – the very companies and activities most responsible for the climate crisis,” says Julia Levin, Climate and Energy Program Manager at Environmental Defence. “Not only is this behaviour incompatible with ensuring a safe and healthy future – this is money removed from public budgets that could otherwise be spent on a just and green recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. We’re giving away wealth to oil and gas companies at the expense of the general public.”

Providing subsidies and public financing to oil and gas companies contributes to climate change, harms our health, diverts resources from public goods to private hands, yields very little in terms of job creation and distorts the energy market.

Canada first announced its commitment to phase out fossil fuel subsidies in 2009. As a result of a decade of inadequate action, Canada now provides more public finance for fossil fuels than any G20 country other than China – and the most on a per capita basis. Yet momentum to end public finance of fossil fuels among Canada’s peers and major trade partners is snowballing. The United Kingdom has already announced it will no longer provide public finance to overseas fossil fuel projects, and President Joe Biden has made eliminating fossil fuels subsidies and public finance a priority.

“Both the upcoming federal budget and Earth Day Leaders Summit on Climate are great opportunities for Canada to announce plans to redirect the support going to fossil fuels and instead put Canada on a path to a genuinely healthier and more resilient future, one that leaves no one behind,” says Levin. “As the government continues to provide unprecedented recovery fundings in response to COVID-19, now is the time to pursue a long-term, planned exit from fossil fuel production that avoids prolonging and deepening the chaos of the past few months, by providing ample support for workers and communities.”

Other key findings of the report include:

In 2020, an additional $15.35 billion was announced in programs, including as part of the new climate plan, that currently lack robust green strings and therefore could result in substantial fossil fuel subsidies if funds are directed to the fossil fuel sector (for example towards fossil fuel derived hydrogen or carbon capture).

A significant portion of the new support provided to oil and gas during the COVID-19 pandemic was under the guise of job creation and achieving environmental outcomes. These subsidies put taxpayers on the hook to clean up industry’s mess, and have not come close to achieving the intended job creation. Rather than spending the funds on additional reclamation work, the major oil companies that undertake the bulk of the work are simply replacing their own spending with federal funding.

Federal government agencies have played a key role in financing the construction of pipelines that have huge carbon footprints, violate Indigenous rights, and put ecosystems at risk. In 2020 alone, crown corporation Export Development Canada provided up to $5.25 billion in financing renewals for the Trans Mountain expansion (a project with an estimated total price tag of at least $12.6 billion) and approved a loan of up to $500 million for the Coastal GasLink pipeline.

Oil and gas companies claimed funds from COVID-support programs such as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS), while continuing to issue shareholder dividends. For example, Imperial Oil claimed $120 million through CEWS and issued $320 million in dividend.

0,Scott Rudin steps down after allegations of abusive behavior including launching baked potato at assistant,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/scott-rudin-bullying-quit-step-down-b1833387.html,"Amid mounting anger over allegations of bullying, Broadway and Hollywood producer Scott Rudin broke his silence Saturday, saying he is “profoundly sorry” and will step back from his theater work.

“After a period of reflection, I’ve made the decision to step back from active participation on our Broadway productions, effective immediately. My roles will be filled by others from the Broadway community and in a number of cases, from the roster of participants already in place on those shows,"" Rudin said in a statement.

The move comes more than a week after The Hollywood Reporter’s cover story on Rudin contained accounts of the producing heavyweight throwing glass bowls, staples and baked potatoes at former employees. In his statement Saturday he did not deny the allegations.

“Much has been written about my history of troubling interactions with colleagues, and I am profoundly sorry for the pain my behavior caused to individuals, directly and indirectly. I am now taking steps that I should have taken years ago to address this behavior,” he said.

The revelations in The Hollywood Reporter also prompted the performers’ unions SAG-AFTRA Actors Equity and the American Federation of Musicians Local 802 to come together condemn illegal harassment and harassment that creates a toxic work environment for entertainment employees.

The revelations also prompted Tony Award-winner Karen Olivo to pull out of returning to “Moulin Rouge! The Musical” once it reopens. There are also plans for a protest March on Broadway on Wednesday, with stops at both Rudin’s office as well as the Winter Garden Theatre, where Rudin is producing the Broadway revival of “The Music Man."" There's also a campaign to persuade Actors’ Equity Association to add Rudin to a Do Not Work list.

In his statement, Rudin mentioned the upcoming reopening of Broadway after the pandemic shuttered theaters for more than a year. He said he did not want to “interrupt” the work ahead.

""My passionate hope and expectation is that Broadway will reopen successfully very soon, and that the many talented artists associated with it will once again begin to thrive and share their artistry with the world.

Chechen police continue to hold him in custody. Twelve Russian and international human rights organizations said that Gadaev is at high risk of torture, as a result of the actions by the French, Russian and Chechen authorities which violated international human rights law.

French authorities outrageously proceeded with Gadaev’s expulsion despite the decision by the national asylum court prohibiting his expulsion if it meant his return to Russia due to substantiated fears for his life and safety. French authorities’ actions have put him at immediate risk of torture and other ill-treatment and exposed him to a grave danger to his life, in flagrant violation of France’s international obligations prohibiting the return of any person, whatever the circumstances, to a territory where they are at risk of serious human rights violations. This prohibition is a non-derogable norm of international law and is affirmed by numerous human rights treaties ratified by France.

On 10 March, the national asylum court issued a ruling that the authorities should not expel Gadaev if it would mean he was returned to Russia because it would likely expose him to harm. But on the morning of 9 April, French authorities forcibly put Gadaev on a flight from Paris to Moscow. On arrival in Moscow, Russian border guards held Gadaev at Shemetyevo airport’s transit zone for over 12 hours, denying him access to his lawyer, Semyon Tsvetkov.

According to Tsvetkov, he repeatedly inquired with the border guards why they were holding Gadaev, who was not on a wanted list in Russia. A border officer hinted to the lawyer about an “agreement” to put Gadaev on a flight to Grozny, Chechnya’s capital, but he did not answer Tsvetkov’s questions as to who “agreed” to this, and on what basis.

In his conversation with border officials, Tsvektov emphasized that Gadaev did not want to be transferred to Chechnya, where his life would be in danger. Finally, after hours of negotiations, the border guards consented to put Gadaev on a flight to Novy Urengoi, a town in the far north of Russia where his close relatives reside. Fearing for his client’s safety, Tsvetkov boarded the same flight. Gadaev and Tsvetkov arrived in Novy Urengoi on 10 April. According to his family members, soon after the flight landed, two Chechens apparently linked with Chechnya’s authorities came to the home of Gadaev’s relatives demanding to see Gadaev and threatening the family with retaliation if they refused to cooperate.

Shortly afterwards, Gadaev and Tsvetkov noticed surveillance of the apartment building where they were staying and received an informal warning from sources in Chechnya that Chechen police were on their way to Novy Urengoi to detain Gadaev. They went to the police station, reported the threats and apparent surveillance to the Novy Urengoi police, and asked for protection. After filing the report, they wanted to leave Novy Urengoi immediately. However the police argued that in the interests of their safety they should either stay at the station or return to the apartment and they would post several police officers there to ensure their security. They opted for the latter.

On 11 April, at around 13:00 local time, the police asked Gadaev and Tsvetkov to go to the local office of Russia’s Investigative Committee to complete some paperwork connected to the report they filed. However, as soon as they left the apartment building, men who failed to identify themselves but whom Tsvetkov believes to have been Chechen law enforcement officials in plain clothes forced Gadaev into a car. When Tsvetkov attempted to get into the car as well, one of the men pushed him away and said they were taking Gadaev with them and that Tsvetkov should go to the police station where the police would provide relevant information. The local uniformed police officers present at the scene did not intervene.

When Tsvetkov arrived at the station, police told him they knew nothing about Gadaev’s whereabouts or the identity of those who took him away. Later, the police informally suggested to Tsvetkov that Gadaev may have been detained in connection with a criminal investigation in Chechnya.

The manner in which the Chechen men took Gadaev bears all the hallmarks of an abduction-style detention. The course of events strongly suggests that the police in Novy Urengoi acted in collusion with the Chechen police by making sure Gadaev remained in the city until the arrival of law enforcement officers from Chechnya and then effectively handed him over to them in violation of due process.

On 12 April, Tsvetkov travelled to Grozny seeking information about his client. The police and the prosecutor’s office claimed they were not aware of the case. However, according to Gadaev’s family members, on the morning of 13 April, Chechen security officials brought him to his parents’ home in the village of Zakan-Yurt to speak briefly with his mother. Gadaev was not visibly hurt. The officers did not explain why they were holding him and quickly led him away, telling his mother that he would not come to harm.

Before his detention Gadaev had repeatedly told Tsvetkov and his relatives that in the event that Chechen authorities detain him and then present a written confession to any crime, it could only mean that the confession had been coerced under torture.

At around 18:00 Moscow time, Tsvetkov finally learned that Gadaev was being held at the Urus-Martan police department. The officer on duty at the gate of the compound confirmed this to Tsvetkov but did not let the lawyer gain access to his client and did not provide any information as to Gadaev’s status in custody or if there were any charges against him.

On 14 April, Tsvetkov finally saw Gadaev at the Urus-Martan police department. Gadaev looked subdued, although visibly unharmed, and told Tsvetkov that he no longer needed his services and already had another lawyer representing him. He also made a written a statement confirming this, but the police did not provide a copy to Tsvetkov. Based on a conversation between police officers, which Tsvetkov overheard, he learnt that Gadaev was to be placed under arrest on charges of illegal possession and circulation of arms (Article 222 of Russia’s Criminal Code) and would be jailed in Grozny pending trial.

There are strong grounds for concern that Gadaev refused the services of his trusted lawyer under duress. He remains at imminent risk of torture and other ill-treatment, and his life is in danger. Torture in Chechnya is widespread. Gadaev is also at risk of an unfair trial.

We also note with great concern that in the months following last year’s horrific murder of Samuel Paty, a teacher in a town on the outskirts of Paris, by 18-year-old Chechen refugee Abdullakh Anzorov, the number of Chechen asylum seekers being deported from France has been on the rise. According to Comité Tchétchénie, a French non-governmental group working to stop human rights abuses in Chechnya, between November 2020 and April 2021, the French authorities deported at least eight asylum seekers of Chechen origin, including Gadaev, to Russia. Two of them – Ilyas Sadulaev, deported from France on 12 March, and Lezi Artsuev, deported from France on 5 April – have disappeared upon return to Russia.

What happened to Gadaev immediately after his return to Russia provides one more stark example of the lack of internal flight alternative elsewhere in the territory of the Russian Federation for asylum seekers from Chechnya.

The French authorities should urgently liaise with the Russian authorities regarding Gadaev’s case to ensure that he does not suffer any violation of his rights, including his rights to life, to be free from torture, to liberty and security, to a remedy and protection of the law and, if he is facing charges, to a fair trial.

As Gadaev’s deportation was conducted in violation of international law and contrary to the ruling of the national asylum court, the French authorities should also take immediate steps to enable Gadaev’s return to France. The French authorities should suspend all pending deportations and extraditions to Russia of Chechens who face a well-founded risk of torture and instead take meaningful steps to provide them with international protection.

Brief overview of Magomed Gadaev’s case

Magomed Gadaev, 37, suffered arbitrary detention and torture from November 2009 to April 2010 in an unlawful detention facility located in a basement on the riot police (OMON) compound in Chechnya. Upon his release, he provided witness testimony about torture and extrajudicial executions perpetrated by the police officers, as part of an official criminal investigation into the abduction and torture of Islam Umarpashaev – another man arbitrarily detained in the same basement. Russian authorities opened the case as a result of relentless efforts by one of Russia’s leading independent human rights organizations, the Committee Against Torture. However, in spite of powerful evidence, none of the perpetrators has been brought to justice.

Fearing for his life because of threats of retaliation by Chechen authorities, Gadaev fled Russia in 2010, initially for Poland. In 2012, Polish authorities granted him asylum, but he continued to receive phone calls and messages, including from the police officers who had tortured him, with death threats and demands that he withdraw his testimony. As those who threatened him were aware of his whereabouts, Gadayev did not feel safe in Poland. In September 2012, he travelled from Poland to France and asked for asylum there. His asylum request and subsequent appeals were rejected, primarily on the grounds that he already had refugee status in Poland. In 2019, French authorities attempted to deport him to Poland, but the Polish government informed them that they had just revoked his refugee status.

In April 2019, French authorities ordered Gadaev to leave for Russia, his country of citizenship, but in June an administrative tribunal prohibited his deportation to Russia. Gadaev filed another asylum request, emphasizing that Poland no longer recognized him as a refugee. In October 2019, the French Office for Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons (OFPRA) refused to review his application, alleging that his presence in France threatened “national security” but providing no detail. In November, Gadaev appealed that decision, and his appeal is currently pending, with the hearing scheduled for April 28.

In December, police authorities ordered Gadaev to leave France and proceed to Poland, citing the OFPRA decision he was in process of appealing. He immediately appealed the police order in an administrative court, but the court rejected his appeal.

Gadaev then filed an application with the French National Court of Asylum. In a ruling dated 10 March, the court ruled that Gadaev could not be deported to Russia as it would put his life and physical security at risk and he could not be sent to Poland as Polish authorities were not providing any guarantees of protection nor that they would refrain from sending him to Russia. The court specifically stated that the executive authorities should not take any steps with regard to Gadaev while his appeal of the OFPRA decision was pending.

However, on 8 April, police authorities seized Gadaev, despite the court’s ruling, and the next day forcibly put him on a Moscow-bound flight, denying him access to his French lawyer during the time he spent in custody.",1904,11782,16,107
0,China state media airs TV 'confession' of Belizean man sentenced for allegedly financing Hong Kong protests,https://hongkongfp.com/2021/04/16/china-state-media-airs-tv-confession-of-belizean-man-sentenced-for-allegedly-financing-hong-kong-protests/,"Chinese state media has aired the purported confession of a Belizean businessman sentenced to 11 years in prison this month for allegedly conspiring with US citizens to fund protests in Hong Kong in 2019.

Henley Lee Huxiang is the first individual to be prosecuted since China amended its criminal code in March to outlaw the provision of support for activities or entities overseas that would endanger national security.

Wednesday’s “confession” came on the eve of Hong Kong’s first National Security Education Day on Thursday. Beijing insists that the 2019 pro-democracy protests by hundreds of thousands of Hongkongers were incited overseas, a charge denied by those taking part.

The overseas TV channels of Chinese state media have been suspended in the UK and in Australia for airing possibly coerced confessions.

Lee, 66, was arrested in November 2019 for allegedly colluding with people in the United States to fuel protests in Hong Kong and to impose sanctions on the territory, a Communist Party newspaper reported at the time.

He was charged in April 2020 and sentenced to 11 years early this month, according to the Focus Report programme on state television CCTV-13 on Wednesday. Lee appeared in a detailed 13-minute segment that included his purported confessions on camera and comments from officers said to have investigated the case.

“Henley Lee is a typical ‘two-faced man’: he tried hard to appear to be a patriotic businessman when he approached government officials, but in private, he has no qualms about his anti-China attitude,” the report said.

In the video, Lee appeared in a grey T-shirt and a red vest marked with an abbreviated term for “national security custody” and was seen briefly in handcuffs.

Lee gave financial support to Hong Kong activist Alex Chow so he could travel overseas to take part in training and a forum in Europe, the CCTV report alleged. His funding also enabled Nathan Law, Joshua Wong and Sunny Cheung to meet foreign politicians, it said.

Chow and Law both denied knowing Lee and said they had received no funds from him, according to statements they posted to Facebook. Chow said the forum was an event in the Czech Republic promoting democracy and travel fees were sponsored by its organisers.

Lee also allegedly gave funds to a man surnamed Yang, who was connected to politicians in an unnamed western country, according to the TV report. The money was intended to support the election campaigns of these “anti-China” lawmakers in 2018, it said.

Lee moved cash overseas with the help of 20 or 30 of his employees, who each carried no more than the US$5,000 allowed by law each time they left the country, according to his purported confession.

He was consulted by foreign politicians as they drafted legislation that would impose sanctions on China, the report said. He persuaded them not to place restrictions on bonded warehouses and dual-use items, and so the legislation ultimately included more severe measures.

“For a Chinese man to offer these suggestions, causing this western country to place more damaging measures to suppress us, this is behaviour typical of a Chinese traitor,” a police officer said in the report.

Safeguard Defenders, a human rights watchdog which monitors televised “confessions” on Chinese state media, said Lee’s case set a precedent in the reach of the country’s security laws beyond its national borders.

“This is a dangerous precedent that cannot be understated and reflects the brand new provisions in China’s Criminal Law, echoing the extraterritorial aspects of the Hong Kong National Security Law,” the group said in a statement.

Lee is the fifth person in recent months to appear on Focus Report and confess to national security crimes, according to the group. “Like Lee, the other four have all stood accused of crimes against national security, some also for ‘instigating’ protests in Hong Kong. The other four are all Taiwanese citizens.”",675,4182,16,107

""If Russia continues to interfere with our democracy, I'm prepared to take further actions to respond. It is my responsibility as president of the United States to do so,"" Biden said from the White House.

""I was clear with President Putin that we could have gone further, but I chose not to do so, I chose to be proportionate,"" Biden said of the measures, adding that he did not want to ""kick off a cycle of escalation and conflict with Russia.""

Biden also said that he proposed in a phone call with Putin that the two meet in person this summer in Europe to discuss a range of pressing issues.

The Biden administration unleashed several sanctions that named 32 Russian individuals and entities for their roles in attempting to influence the 2020 U.S. presidential election, five individuals and three entities linked to Russia's illegal annexation of Ukraine's Crimea, and six technology companies for supporting support Russian Intelligence Services.

In addition, the State Department announced the expulsion of 10 officials from the Russian Embassy in Washington.

Russia has long brushed off allegations of meddling in U.S. elections, human rights abuses, cyberattacks as well as reports of placing bounties on U.S. troops serving in Afghanistan.

Last month, the Biden administration issued its first sanctions on Russia over the alleged poisoning and subsequent detention of Putin critic Alexey Navalny.

Navalny, a leading critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, flew to Russia from Berlin, where he spent nearly half a year recovering for a nerve agent poisoning that took place last August. He was arrested at passport control and later sentenced to more than two years in prison. The U.S. reiterated its calls for his immediate release.

The Kremlin has repeatedly denied having a role in Navalny's poisoning.

0,Myanmar’s lost generation: nation’s youth sacrificing futures for freedom | Global development | The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/apr/15/myanmars-lost-generation-young-people-sacrifice-futures-for-freedom,"For Myanmar’s young people, 2021 was supposed to be a year for optimism. After seeing through the Covid-19 pandemic, the rollout of the vaccine had begun and general elections in November had marked a step towards the country realising its potential.

But in the wake of the 1 February coup, their dreams have turned into nightmares, as many of Myanmar’s young people have found themselves forced to sacrifice their futures to take a stand against the military.

Aspiring engineer, Hlyan Phyo Aung, 22, is one of them. News portal Myanmar Now reported that he was hurt by an explosion during a crackdown on a protest in the central city of Magway on 27 March. A soldier reportedly shot off his injured hand at close range, another shot multiple rubber bullets into his other hand, and then troops kicked him in the face until onlookers flung themselves over him, saving his life.

His right hand was amputated at the wrist; he may also permanently lose the use of his left hand. His left leg was shot eight times and may also be amputated, his right thigh has two bullet wounds, his face was battered and damage to his eyesight caused by the impact of the gunshots may also be irreparable. The military has stopped him from receiving treatment outside one of its own hospitals, and is also charging him with incitement, which carries up to three years in jail.

His story echoes the brutality borne by other protesters of his generation. Among the first civilian casualties was a 19-year-old girl shot in the head by security forces. Then came an endless list of ruined futures – a 24-year-old father who lost his leg after being shot in Yangon on 10 March, in the north-west region of Sagaing, a 20-year-old man whose leg was also amputated after the military reportedly threw a hand grenade, a 19-year-old student shot dead near Yangon on 27 March, and even younger casualties on the same day, such as a 14-year-old girl who died in her home after security forces sprayed bullets in a neighbourhood, and a seven-year-old girl shot while sitting on her father’s lap in Mandalay.

Some of those who survived the attacks have been maimed for life or are unable to work as a result of their injuries.

‘I wanted a happy life’

“I wrote content, worked hard and spent a lot of time with friends,” says Wai, 21, an online culture writer. “My future was clear: I wanted a good job, a happy family and a peaceful life.”

But since the military seized power, Wai’s main goal has been to avoid the junta’s forces, who have killed and maimed hundreds of his peers. Now unemployed because of the economic crisis triggered in the coup’s aftermath, he fears junta troops will hunt him down.

A 2014 consensus showed that more than 50% of Myanmar’s population was under the age of 30. This segment has direct knowledge of the military’s disastrous rule that over decades impoverished a once-prosperous nation, but also a decade of exposure to the outside world as well as better access to information, education and job opportunities. Faced once more with a military dictatorship, their role in the anti-coup movement is testament to the sacrifices they are willing to make for hard-earned rights.

“If the junta beats this revolution, our future is gone,” says Wai, who saw a fellow protester shot dead in North Okkalapa, a township in Myanmar’s biggest city Yangon, on 8 March – a week before martial law was declared in the area.

“If they win, I won’t marry or have children because I wouldn’t want my family to live under their control. International relations would be ruined, and life would become like North Korea. We’ll protest as much as we can until we win. It is worth giving your life for the next generation.”

The regime’s forces have killed at least 714 people since the coup, according to the Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), but hundreds more are likely to have been seriously wounded by live rounds, mortar fire, hand grenades and other weapons used by the military.

It is worth giving your life for the next generation Wai

The country risks spiralling into “full-blown conflict,” according to UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, who on Tuesday urged countries to push the military into halting its violent repression against citizens.

Following the latest massacre of at least 82 civilians in Bago, she said the world “must not allow the deadly mistakes of the past in Syria and elsewhere to be repeated.”

Atrocities have become increasingly difficult to record because of the regime’s shutdown of mobile data and wireless broadband that has blocked internet access for most of the population. Meanwhile, analysts have warned of a dramatic reversal in the economic progress Myanmar gained over the past decade. The World Bank has projected the economy to shrink 10% in 2021, but Fitch Solutions has forecast a 20% decline in growth for the 2020-21 fiscal year and impending “economic collapse”.

While some protesters have begun to use makeshift weapons against security forces, hundreds of others are reportedly travelling to territory controlled by ethnic armed groups where they are receiving training in basic warfare. Clashes are intensifying between the ethnic groups and the Tatmadaw, which has deployed deadly airstrikes near Myanmar’s borders with China and Thailand. Recent reports indicate that the military has also sentenced to death 23 people following secret trials, including four protesters.

Ruined futures

Another victim of military brutality was Thet Paing Soe, 30, who was supporting his mother with his salary as a driver.

On 20 March, Thet Paing Soe was shot while hiding from security forces down an alley in Yangon’s Tamwe township. His family rushed the funeral because they feared soldiers would seize the body.

The second youngest of six siblings and not yet married, his loss “could not be put into words,” said the brother. “I am still suffering,” he says. “If it were possible, I would fight back, but [without weapons] we are still unable to do that.”

After glimpsing life under a government chosen by the people, Min Thura, 23, felt he had no choice but to demonstrate against a return to military rule.

Before the coup, he applied for a warehouse job in Yangon and on 4 March came the good news: his interview was successful. But it was too late by then. Security forces had shot him in the left eye with a rubber bullet the previous day, causing damage to his right eye as well. Forced to decline the role and go into the care of his family, he said his doctor doubts he will recover his eyesight.

“I have to accept that I will no longer be able to see,” he says.

As plans come together for a federal army to face the Tatmadaw, Min Thura said young people should join the resistance.

“I don’t want our citizens to get hurt or die any more because we’re all brothers and sisters,” he said, adding that if the international community is planning to help: “please help us as quickly as possible.”",1262,7406,15,109

Article content Citing rising COVID-19 case numbers, on Friday the Province of Ontario enacted one of the strictest lockdowns yet seen in the Western world, including empowering police to stop and question any person seen outside their home. “Moving forward, police will have the authority to require any individual who is not in a place of residence to, first, provide their purpose for not being at home, and provide their home address,” said Ontario Solicitor General Sylvia Jones in a livestreamed Friday news conference. She added, “police will also have the authority to stop a vehicle to inquire about an individual’s reason for leaving their residence.” We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

The new orders effectively confine Ontario’s 14 million people to their home, save for a handful of permitted activities. “It is imperative that everyone limit their trips outside of the home to permitted purposes only, such as going to the grocery store or pharmacy, medical appointments, outdoor exercise, or for work that cannot be done remotely,” said Jones.

Article content It’s also a departure from January, when Jones’ office had specifically assured the public that police would not be stopping Ontarians simply for being outside. “On its own, being outside is not sufficient evidence of a failure to comply with the stay-at-home order,” a spokesman had said at the time. More On This Topic Ontario gives police new powers to enforce stay-home order and ban on outdoor gatherings Ontario needs aggressive vaccination drive to flatten COVID-19 curve, experts say Although the new measures would not pass Charter of Rights muster under any conventional circumstances, they are made possible thanks to wide-reaching provisions contained in the Canadian Quarantine Act. The 2005 act specifically empowers warrantless arrests, and allows peace officers to detain anyone they “believe has refused to be isolated or refuses to comply with a measure.” Accompanying the expansion of law enforcement powers was what Ontario Premier Doug Ford called the “strictest measures in all of North America.” This included a full shutdown of outdoor amenities, including golf courses, basketball courts and playgrounds. Under the prior provisions of the Reopening Ontario Act, anyone caught on a jungle gym until the lifting of the measure can face fines of $750, to an individual maximum of $100,000 and up to a year in jail.

Article content While Ontario had previously allowed outdoor gatherings of up to five people, that has now been limited to “members of one’s own household.” Jones also announced the partial closure of Ontario’s borders with the rest of Canada. Starting at midnight on Monday, roadblocks at the Manitoba and Quebec borders will now turn away any traveller who can’t prove they are travelling for work, medical care or the exercise of Indigenous treaty rights. “Should an individual not have a valid reason to enter Ontario, they will be turned back,” said Jones. Although this marks the most consequential intranational border closure since the arrival of COVID-19 to Canada, it is not without precedent. The territory of Nunavut has imposed strict restrictions on the arrival of non-residents during the pandemic. As well, the “Atlantic Bubble,” a travel-restricted area enacted by Canada’s Atlantic provinces, was enforced in part by peace officers stationed on land crossings from Quebec. The enforced stay-at-home orders are indeed the broadest COVID-19 restrictions yet observed in the Western hemisphere, although they do echo the hard lockdowns observed by New Zealand in the first weeks of the pandemic. Italy has also returned to strict lockdowns following a rise in cases and hospitalizations, and have mobilized 70,000 additional police to enforce it.

0,"Biden declares Russia threat 'national emergency,' lobs sanctions; 10 diplomats booted over election meddling",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-russia-threat-national-emergency-sanctions,"President Biden on Thursday signed an executive order declaring a ""national emergency"" over the threat from Russia, as his administration slapped new sanctions on the country.

The U.S. Department of State said it is expelling 10 officials from Russia’s bilateral mission.

""Today, we announced actions to hold the Russian Government to account for the SolarWinds intrusion, reports of bounties on U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan, and attempts to interfere in the 2020 U.S. elections,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.

SECRETARY OF STATE BLINKEN VISITS AFGHANISTAN IN SURPRISE TRIP AFTER BIDEN TROOP ANNOUNCEMENT

The White House also released a letter to Congress stating that the president has issued ""an Executive Order declaring a national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by specified harmful foreign activities of the Government of the Russian Federation.""

The letter said that Russia had aimed to ""undermine the conduct of free and fair democratic elections,"" engaged in ""malicious cyber-enabled activities,"" targeted journalists and dissenters outside of its borders, and violated international law.

This, Biden said in the letter, constitutes ""an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.""

Blinken's statement went into more detail, citing not only the SolarWinds hack that compromised many agencies in the federal government but also the poisoning of top Putin political rival Alexei Navalny.

PUTIN SO UPSET OVER BIDEN'S KILLER COMMENTS HE MOVED 28,222 RUSSIAN TROOPS TO UKRAINE BORDER, REPORT

""We remain concerned about Navalny’s health and treatment in prison, and call for his unconditional release,"" Blinken said. Navalny is currently in the custody of the Russian government and reported not to be well. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki previously said that ""[t]he Russian government is responsible for his health and well-being.""

Blinken also emphasized Thursday, however, ""the United States will also seek opportunities for cooperation with Russia, with the goal of building a more stable and predictable relationship consistent with U.S. interests.""

Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov, according to the Russian state-run media organization TASS, said ""[w]e condemn any pursuit of sanctions, we consider them illegal. In any case, the principle of reciprocity in this matter is valid; reciprocity in a way that best serves our interests.""

""It goes without saying that possible sanctions being discussed would by no means promote such a meeting,"" Peskov also said, regarding a potential in-person meeting between Putin and Biden.

Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova meanwhile said at a news conference that Russia has summoned the U.S. ambassador for a ""hard conversation,"" but didn't immediately detail specific retaliatory actions from Russia.

The tough stance from the Biden administration comes as tensions have escalated between the U.S. and Russia during the president's first three months. Biden called Putin a killer in his first sit-down interview after taking office. Putin was reportedly so upset over the comment that he left his quarantine, got a COVID-19 vaccination and moved 28,000 Russian troops to the border with Ukraine.

Russian Bear bombers went into action, forcing NATO to scramble 10 jets to intercept the Russian warplanes flying over the North Atlantic Ocean earlier this month, a rare show of force near the Arctic. Last week, Putin quietly changed Russia’s constitution to allow him to stay in power until 2036. He would be 83 years old.

When three Russian submarines burst through the Arctic ice in a synchronized exercise in late March, the Pentagon took notice and Putin praised the naval achievement. Each Russian sub can carry 16 ballistic missiles.

""We're monitoring very closely. Nobody wants to see the Arctic as a region become militarized,"" Defense Department press secretary John Kirby told reporters at the Pentagon.

The crash happened at 11:25 p.m. in the Carlton Woods subdivision near The Woodlands. The car burst into flames after hitting a tree near 18 Hammock Dunes Place.

Harris County Precinct 4 Constable Mark Herman told KPRC 2 that the investigation showed “no one was driving” the fully-electric 2019 Tesla when the accident happened. There was a person in the passenger seat of the front of the car and in the rear passenger seat of the car.

2 men killed in Tesla car fire in Spring

Deadly car crash under investigation in Spring

Herman said authorities believe no one else was in the car and that it burst into flames immediately. He said it he believes it wasn’t being driven by a human.

Harris County Constable Precinct 4 deputies said the vehicle was traveling at a high speed when it failed to negotiate a cul-de-sac turn, ran off the road and hit the tree.

KPRC 2 reporter Deven Clarke spoke to one man’s brother-in-law who said he was taking the car out for a spin with his best friend, so there were just two in the vehicle.

The owner, he said, backed out of the driveway, and then may have hopped in the back seat only to crash a few hundred yards down the road. He said the owner was found in the back seat upright.

The brother-in-law of one of the victims said relatives watched the car burn for four hours as authorities tried to tap out the flames.

Authorities said they used 32,000 gallons of water to extinguish the flames because the vehicle’s batteries kept reigniting. At one point, Herman said, deputies had to call Tesla to ask them how to put out the fire in the battery.

Authorities will perform autopsies on both men.",381,2130,19,111

In an order titled “Complete Blocking of Social Media Platforms,” the Pakistani government ordered Pakistan Telecommunication Authority to block social media platforms including Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube and Telegram from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. local time (06.00 a.m. to 10.00 a.m. GMT) Friday.

The move comes as Pakistan looks to crack down against a violent terrorist group and prevent troublemakers from disrupting Friday prayer congregations following days of violent protests.

Earlier this week Pakistan banned the Islamist group Tehrik-i-Labaik Pakistan after arresting its leader, which prompted protests, according to local media reports.

An entrepreneur based in Pakistan told TechCrunch that even though the order is supposed to expire at 3 p.m. local time, similar past moves by the government suggests that the disruption will likely last longer.

Though Pakistan, like its neighbor India, has temporarily cut phone call access in the nation in the past, this is the first time Islamabad has issued a blanket ban on social media in the country.

Pakistan has explored ways to assume more control over content on digital services operating in the country in recent years. Some activists said the country was taking extreme measures without much explanation.",218,1442,13,112
0,Iran has named a suspect it alleges is responsible for the attack on the country’s vital nuclear site in Natanz.,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/iran-nuclear-natanz-attack-suspect-b1833238.html,"Iran has named a suspect it alleges is responsible for the attack on the country’s nuclear facility in Natanz.

The incident at the country’s main uranium enrichment facility last week – which Tehran quickly blamed on Israel – cast a shadow over vital ongoing talks in Vienna aimed at salvaging the international deal intended to block Iran’s route to creating a nuclear arsenal.

Iranian state TV said on Saturday that intelligence officials had named Reza Karimi, a 43-year-old born in the city Kashan, as the “perpetrator of this sabotage”.

The report accused Mr Karimi of fleeing the country “hours before” the attack at the Ahmadi Roshan facility, which Iranian president Hassan Rouhani gave as justification for Tehran’s decision to start enriching uranium to a purity of up to 60 per cent – levels well above the 3.67 per cent limit enshrined in the nuclear deal currently under discussion and strong enough to be used in a so-called “dirty bomb”.

“Necessary steps are under way for his arrest and return to the country through legal channels,” the report said, also broadcasting an image which appeared to show an Interpol Red Notice seeking Mr Karimi’s arrest.

The arrest notice was not available on Interpol’s public-facing database at the time of publication, and the international agency did not respond to a request by The Independent for clarification on whether one had been issued.

The apparent Interpol Red Notice listed his travel history as including Ethiopia, Kenya, the Netherlands, Qatar, Romania, Turkey, Uganda and the United Arab Emirates. The state TV report did not elaborate how Mr Karimi would have gained access to one of the most secure facilities in the Islamic Republic.

Alireza Zakani, an MP who heads up the Iranian parliament’s research centre, was quoted widely this week as saying the attack had damaged and destroyed thousands of centrifuges – machines used to refine uranium. However, no other official has offered such an estimate, and no photos of the aftermath have been released.

Israel has not officially confirmed or denied involvement, but media outlets in the country initially reported that the damage was the result of a cyberattack, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying hours after the attack that “the struggle against Iran and its proxies and the Iranian armament efforts is a huge mission”. A previous Mossad-CIA operation in 2010 targeted the facility with a computer virus, reportedly setting Iran’s nuclear ambitions back several years.

But the TV report by Islamic Republic Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) on Saturday spoke of a “limited explosion of a small part of the electricity-feeding path to the centrifuges' hall”, adding: “The explosion happened because of the function of explosive materials and there was no cyberattack.”

The report also showed centrifuges in a hall, as well as what appeared to be caution tape at the Natanz facility. In one shot, a reporter interviewed an unnamed technician, who said: “The sound that you are hearing is the sound of operating machines that are fortunately undamaged.”

The man – filmed from behind to hide his identity – claimed that “many of the centrifuge chains that faced defects are now under control, adding: “Part of the work that had been disrupted will be back on track with the round-the-clock efforts of my colleagues.”

Meanwhile, in Vienna, negotiations seeking to rescue the nuclear deal, called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), continued on Saturday, with diplomats on both sides suggesting difficult progress had been made.

“We think that the talks have reached a stage where parties are able to begin to work on a joint draft,” said Iranian negotiator Abbas Araghchi. “It seems that a new understanding is taking shape, and now there is agreement over final goals.”

And Enrique Mora, the European Union official who chaired the talks, tweeted that “progress has been made in a far from easy task”, adding: “We need now more detailed work.”

Saturday’s meeting saw diplomats from the five powers remaining in the deal – the UK, France, Russia, China and Germany – reconvene for talks, with expert-level working groups on sanctions lifting and nuclear activities set to continue in the coming week.

Despite several failed attempts to resume negotiations, it is the first time such a meeting has been held since former US president Donald Trump announced in 2018 that he was pulling out of the deal struck by his predecessor Barack Obama three years prior, and was reimposing punishing economic sanctions on Iran, which has since been wracked by recession.

While the White House’s new occupant Joe Biden is keen to rejoin the nuclear deal, Tehran’s interest lies – ahead of looming elections – in seeing the lifting of sanctions, the impacts of which have been felt harshly by Iranian residents.

While one EU diplomat told Agence France-Presse earlier this week that Sunday’s attack and Iran’s nuclear response had “complicated” discussions in Vienna, Ali Vaez of the International Crisis Group think tank was quoted as saying that the events had added “urgency” to the talks by reminding “both parties that the status quo is a lose-lose situation”.

“It is clear that the more the diplomatic process drags on, the higher the risk that it gets derailed by saboteurs and those acting in bad faith,” Mr Vaez said.

Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful, and an annual US intelligence report released on Tuesday maintained the longtime American assessment that Iran isn’t currently trying to build a nuclear bomb.

The country’s newly announced intention to enrich uranium up to 60 per cent purity would still fall significantly below the 90 per cent purity required for a modern nuclear weapon – but it is three times higher than its previous efforts.

Iran previously had said it could use uranium enriched up to 60 per cent for nuclear-powered ships, however it currently has no such ships in its navy.

Mr Macron visited the building site on Thursday to view the progress on the rebuilding project and argued that the country’s heritage had not been forgotten despite delays caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

“We’re seeing here how, in two years, a huge job has been accomplished,” Mr Macron said, flanked by ministers, architects and the retired French army general who is overseeing the restoration.

“We’re all impressed with what we see, with the work that has been achieved in two years. Bravo,” he told workers at the site.

“We’ve done a lot, and we’ve avoided the worst.”

The president added that it was clear that more work remained to be done on the project, as he recalled the “emotion” throughout France on the day of the shocking fire in April 2019.

He also offered a ""huge thank you"" and a message of determination to all the workers mobilised for the restoration project.

Mr Macron had promised that the cathedral would be rebuilt by 2024, but officials have acknowledged work will not be fully completed by then.

Factors such as the Covid-19 pandemic have contributed to the slower than expected pace of the reconstruction, along with other complications, such as the vast amounts of toxic lead distributed onto Notre Dame following the blaze.

Officials warned this month that the cathedral and its esplanade could remain under construction for another 15 or 20 years, but they have pledged to make sure that it will be open for prayer at least by the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.

“The objective... is to return Notre Dame to worshippers and to visits in 2024. That means that in 2024, Mass will be able to be organised in the cathedral,” Jeremie Patrier-Leitus, a spokesperson for the restoration, said.

Since 2019, religious ceremonies have taken place at Notre Dame’s temporary liturgical base at the nearby church of Saint-Germain l’Auxerrois.

0,Black Lives Matter founder Patrisse Khan-Cullors breaks down in interview over right-wing attacks on her new home,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/patrisse-cullors-blm-founder-home-b1832846.html,"Black Lives Matter (BLM) co-founder Patrisse Cullors held back tears while discussing criticism she faced last week over her housing portfolio, worth $3m (£2.17m).

Ms Cullors, 37, who created the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter in 2013 and later co-founded the Black Lives Matter Network, was criticised last week after the New York Post revealed that she had spent $1.4m (£1.017m) on a Los Angeles property, her third residence in the city and fourth overall.

She has bought two other homes in the Los Angeles area over the last few years, which sit in her portfolio alongside a 3.2-acre property in Georgia that she purchased for $415,000 (£301,950).

Questions were raised about how the director of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation had acquired the funds to pay for the properties, with Black sports journalist Jason Whitlock accusing her and other BLM founders of “making millions of dollars off the backs of these dead Black men who they wouldn’t spit on if they were on fire and alive”.

However, during an interview with Marc Lamont Hill for Black News Tonight on Thursday, Ms Cullors described the scrutiny over her homes as a “racist and sexist” attack by the “right-wing media”.

Ms Cullors also rejected claims that the purchases go against her self-described ideology as a “trained Marxist”, explaining that she bought the homes for her family, and defines her wealth “as my family’s money, as well”.

She added: “I think that is critique that is wanting. The way that I live my life is a direct support to Black people, including my Black family members, first and foremost.

“For so many Black folks who are able to invest in themselves and their communities they choose to invest in their family and that is what I have chosen to do.”

Ms Cullors then told Mr Hill that she thinks the criticism over her properties is part of an effort to discredit her work and BLM’s activism.

“The whole point of these articles and these attacks against me are to discredit me, but also to discredit the movement,” she said.

“We have to stay focused on white supremacy,’ she added as she urged people to ‘see through the right-wing lies,’” Ms Cullors added.

After being asked how she has coped with the criticism by Mr Hill, she then held back tears and revealed that she hired security last week after the initial reports came out and her new home was pictured in the media.

“I spent the last week with security and these articles have shown the homes that I live in and that my family lives in,” she said as she held back tears.

“I have not just been a target of white supremacists and the right in this moment but obviously since the beginning of when I started Black Lives Matter I have been a target and these folks have created a much more dangerous situation for me and my family. It is very serious.”

The criticism last week prompted BLM to release a statement on Tuesday denying paying for the properties.

The group revealed that Ms Cullors has not been paid by them since 2019 and that she had only received around $120,000 (£87,234) since the organisation’s founding in 2013, for “duties such as serving as spokesperson and engaging in political education work”.

BLM added: “All Black activists know the fear these malicious and serious actions are meant to instil: the fear of being silenced, the trauma of being targeted, the torture of feeling one’s family is exposed to danger just for speaking out against unjust systems.

“We have seen this tactic of terror time and again, but our movement will not be silenced.”

Since helping found BLM in 2013 following George Zimmerman’s acquittal for killing Trayvon Martin, Ms Cullors has written a best-selling memoir and has signed a deal to create content with Warner Bros.

Eleven people were killed and 98 injured in a train accident in Egypt’s Qalyubia province north of Cairo, the health ministry said in a statement.

The train was heading from Cairo to the Nile Delta city of Mansoura when four carriages derailed at 1:54pm (11:54 GMT), about 40km (25 miles) north of Cairo, Egyptian National Railways said in a short statement.

The cause of the accident is being investigated, it added.

More than 50 ambulances rushed to the site and moved the injured to three hospitals in the province, the health ministry said.

Videos on social media purportedly showed carriages overturned and passengers escaping to safety along the railway.

Derailed train carriages in Egypt’s Qalyubia province north of Cairo [AFP]

Egypt has seen several railway tragedies in recent years.

At least 20 people were killed and nearly 200 were injured in March when two trains collided near Tahta, about 440km (275 miles) south of Cairo.

Earlier this week, 15 people were injured after another train derailed in the northern province of Minya al-Qamh.

Egypt’s transportation minister Kamel al-Wazir, a former army general, has faced calls to resign from some Egyptians on social media. He has rejected these and said he would keep working on developing the ageing rail network.

In February 2019 an unmanned locomotive slammed into a barrier inside Cairo’s main Ramses railway station, causing a huge explosion and a fire that killed at least 25 people. That crash prompted the then-transportation minister to resign.

Egypt’s deadliest train crash was in 2002, when more than 370 people were killed after a fire broke out in an overnight train travelling from Cairo to southern Egypt.",292,1794,21,114

Gaarder's death comes several days after he hosted two illegal house parties on March 26 and 27. It is unclear how many people attended. He is thought to have been ill for several weeks but kept it secret local officials believe, newsinenglish.no reported.

Local media reported that more than a dozen attendees have since tested positive for the virus and continued to pass it on.

""We don't know how many or who took part in the arrangements, but ask all participants to take a corona test as soon as possible,"" police said in a press release, according to newsinenglish.no.

Gaarder was a prominent conspiracy theorist who used various social media channels to peddle false information relating to the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the US election in 2020.

He frequently compared COVID-19 to ""something that will be like a cold or light flu"" and incorrectly argued that it doesn't spread from person to person.

Gaarder also frequently posted about the Illuminati and argued that Joe Biden's election victory in 2020 was illegitimate.

Last month, the municipality of Gan banned social gatherings to prevent the further spread of the virus.

0,Polish MoD Unveils Air Force Modernization Plan. Over USD 30 billion to be spent on Integrated Air and Missile Defence,https://www.defence24.com/polish-mod-unveils-air-force-modernization-plan-over-30-usd-billion-to-be-spent-on-integrated-air-and-missile-defence,"Parliamentary National Defence Commission assembled to discuss the information provided by the Minister of Defence, concerning the status of the Polish Air Force, its mission readiness, and the planned steps in modernization. A lot of concrete data was released during the debate, including the number of combat-capable F-16 jets, or delivery dates and HEAD operations start date associated with the Boeing 737s. The Polish MoD also outlined the amounts involved and timelines regarding the programmes that concern both the Air Force, as well as other branches of the military - including procurement of UAS and air defence systems.

The meeting began with a statement by the undersecretary at the Polish Ministry of Defence, Wojciech Skurkiewicz, who presented the information that the Polish MoD provided. As stated by Skurkiewicz, the Polish combat aviation component utilizes 48 F-16 aircraft spread among three squadrons. Another three squadrons: a single Su-22 unit, and two MiG-29 elements; are used solely in peacetime. MiG-29 jets are also deployed to conduct air policing missions, in the Baltics, and in Poland as well. In case of war, the Soviet-made aircraft would be virtually useless. Responding to the questions asked by the MPs, regarding the number of aircraft capable of undertaking operational activities, Skurkiewicz also provided definitive numbers. 41 out of 48 F-16s exhibit full combat capability - this is a number that is higher than the one we obtained last year (a bit over 30 airframes translating into around 60% of availability). The above means that the operational readiness of the Polish F-16 fleet now exceeds 80%. On one hand, this is a significantly high value, exceeding the analogous indicator in the USAF (around 70%).

On the other hand, though, readiness as such is a must, considering the limited overall number of aircraft remaining in the inventory of the Polish Air Force. Skurkiewicz also noted that 28 MiG-29s and 18 Su-22s are also being operated by the service, without any details referring to the availability. Responding to safety concerns raised by the MPs, when it comes to the Fulcrums, amidst the failures and crashes of the recent years, a statement was made by the Air Force Inspector, Div. Gen. Jacek Pszczoła. He said that the Bydgoszcz-based WZL facility has learned its painful lesson, and now it is trusted by both him and the pilots, with the safety levels being satisfactory.

Skurkiewicz announced that Harpia programme aimed at the acquisition of 32 F-35As along with a training and logistics package is currently underway. The acquisition itself is to have a price tag of around PLN 20 bn. If the infrastructure and armament-related investments are taken into the equation, the amount would be as high as 28.6 bn zlotys (7,5 USD billion).

Responding to a question asked by Maciej Lasek (KO MP), referring to the plans of withdrawal with regard to MiG-29 and Su-22, Skurkiewicz said that the Su-22 Fitters would be decommissioned in 2025, while the withdrawal process regarding the MiG-29 would progress gradually, along with the F-35 deliveries. MP Mroczek raised a concern that there is no plan in place, regarding the new structure of the Air Force. Responding to that, General Pszczoła said that by 2030 the Polish Air Force is to consist of five complete squadrons, 16 airframes in each squadron.

This, however, is not exhaustive. “In the back of my head, I believe that Harpia programme would result in the procurement of 4 squadrons, ultimately. It is not my place to say as to what type of aircraft would be procured next, but by 2035 another two squadrons would exist. Seven squadrons, 16 aircraft in each, by 2035”, Pszczoła said. Skurkiewicz also said that, depending on the finances, a decision to procure more combat aircraft after 2035 may be made. The official noted that the F-35 acquisition is a long-term investment, with the platform acting as a “domain integrator” boosting the capabilities of the Polish defence system. It is expected that they would be able to serve until the year 2070.

Skurkiewicz also outlined the status of the Polish airlift assets, with that component currently operating 59 aircraft, including 39 Bryzas (PZL Mielec M28), 16 C296Ms, 5 C-130 Hercules, 2 Gulfstream G550s, and a single Boeing 737-800. A procedure is underway, to procure five second-hand C-130H airframes, within the framework of EDA.

The MPs were also asking questions regarding the date of delivery of the two remaining Boeing airframes that have been already ordered. Pszczoła said that following the delays related to retrofitting of the aircraft in France, and delays resulting on the grounds of the pandemic, the aircraft in question will be arriving in Poland soon. The first one is expected to arrive in May, while the second - in June this year. Both are also expected to gain operational readiness in July. Pszczoła also announced that the sole Boeing aircraft delivered until today (“Józef Piłsudski”) would then leave for Toulouse on 21st June for retrofitting. The retrofitted airframe would come back to Warsaw in December. Representatives of the MoD also noted that three crews per aircraft have been trained to carry out VIP flights.

Within the context of the VIP aircraft, a dispute emerged regarding the procurement process of those. Czesław Mroczek indicated that an amount of 1.7 bn zlotys had been allocated to that acquisition earlier, while 3.05 bn. was the actual price paid for them, during the term of office of Macierewicz and Kownacki. Grabarczyk MP (KO) also pointed out that the acquisition was subjected to critique by the Supreme Chamber of Control. Bartosz Kownacki responded, stating that the Boeings, at the time of the acquisition, were the only aircraft meeting the Polish requirements defined for the VIP transport platforms. Kownacki said that the former government, allocating just PLN 1.7 bn. zlotys to the acquisition in question was unreasonable. Leasing of the Embraer airliners from Lot Polish Airlines was referred to, by Kownacki, as a waste. Kownacki added that no respectable government transports VIPs onboard aircraft that belong to the class of those leased by the Polish state. A similar opinion was voiced by MP Rozenek (SLD), stating that the matter shall be looked at in an objective manner. “The Polish state stopped using half-measures, and we are witnessing positive results. Critique directed against this procurement is not understandable to me”, he said.

The discussion was also quite intense when it came to helicopters. Skurkiewicz informed that the Polish military currently operates 238 rotary-wing aircraft, including 68 W-3, 22 SW-4, 58 Mi-2, 25 Mi-8, 19 Mi-17, 10 Mi-14, 4 SH-2H, 28 Mi-24, and 4 Black Hawks.

He also said that 4 ASW/SAR AW101 helicopters were procured. Black Hawks, meanwhile, are undergoing retrofitting to meet the requirements of the user, namely the SOF component. The process of retrofitting is expected to be finalized by the end of this year. 4 W-3 Sokół SAR platforms, meanwhile, are being upgraded to a common W-3WA SAR/FADEC standard. The first two aircraft would be handed off in July this year, with another two to follow in October 2022. Before that, similar upgrades had been implemented on 8 Sokół helicopters, it is expected that 20 would undergo similar upgrades. All of those would be received by the 1st and 2nd SAR (ASAR) Groups and the 33rd Airlift Base. Kondor naval helicopter procurement procedure and Kruk attack helicopter acquisition are in progress as well. As for now, the Technical Modernization Plan envisages allocation of an amount of PLN 16.2 bn. to the upgrades of the helicopter fleet.

During the meeting, another discussion took place referring to the resignation from the acquisition of the 50 Caracal helicopters.

Skurkiewicz also outlined the status of the training component in the Air Force. Currently, it comprises 52 aircraft: 28 PZL-130 Orlik (some of which are undergoing TC-II Advanced upgrades), eight M-346 Bielik AJTs (another four have arrived and are going through the handing-off procedure), 8 TS-11 Iskra trainers, 8 Bryza aircraft, and 33 SW-4 and Mi-2 helicopters, plus a simulator center at the 41st Training Aviation Base in Dęblin. Bryza, Mi-2, and SW-4 aircraft were all included in the previously quoted status reports regarding the airlift and helicopter assets. Implementation of a programme aimed at establishing infrastructure for the M-346 is underway now.

When it comes to the UAVs, the Minister mentioned the 12th Base in Mirosławiec operating 15 Mini Orbiter 2B elements. Procurement procedures are in progress, regarding the acquisition of the tactical short range UAVs (Orlik), 15 medium-range tactical Gryf UAVs, and four MALE UAVs (Zefir). Col. Waldemar Bogusławski, speaking on behalf of the Armament Inspectorate, added that two agreements are being drafted now, regarding the micro-UAVs and the Orlik programme. The mini-UAV procurement procedure is also being carried out now (Wizjer). Furthermore, the MoD also launched an acquisition programme regarding the Albatros naval UAV platforms.

The opposition MPs were indicating that the UAV procurement plans are insufficient, taking into account the recent experiences of the Armenia/Azerbaijan conflict and the global trends in the development of assets as such.

Information pertaining to the plans related to UAV procurement presented by the MoD (and the information regarding the air defence assets outlined below), most probably refers to the Air Force, and other branches of the military as well (Land Forces, receiving the Poprad SHORAD systems, or the Navy, expected to receive the Albatros systems).

Skurkiewicz also addressed the air defence assets issues. Currently, Wisła air/missile defence system, Narew SHORAD system, Pilica AAA/SAM system, Poprad VSHORAD system, Piorun MANPADS system, SONA AAA system, Noteć AAA system, Nida aerial counter-UAS system, Bystra radars, and Grzmot short-range missile system proceedings are underway in that domain. Together, the aforesaid tasks have a value of 122.6 bn. zlotys (over 32 USD billion), as defined within the Technical Modernization Plan.

Modernization of the radio-technical component’s inventory is also going on. NUR-31 and NUR-41 radars are bound to be replaced by new, domestically developed NUR-15M systems (15 examples). A project also has been launched to develop a domestic long-range radar (known as Warta - 17 radars to be acquired). Finally, the military also plans to procure 15 ATC radars, within the framework of a project named Drawa. To lower the level of the radar coverage in the East, four Aerostat-based radars would be acquired. The procurement programme is codenamed Barbara, when it comes to these assets.",1718,10795,20,118

The controversial public cash 'passport' proposal is contained within Executive Office reports relating to the Communities in Transition (CIT) scheme.

It states that convicted terrorists should be ""eligible"" to ask the PSNI for an endorsement, and that should then allow them to work with community organisations including those in ""receipt of public money"".

The demand has caused further concerns among politicians already reeling from the news that paramilitary-supported groups are to be handed £10m of public cash.

One senior source told this newspaper: ""This is effectively paramilitaries asking for a police-endorsed 'passport' to allow them to access taxpayers' money. It's a ridiculous suggestion to expect the PSNI to get involved in this.""

Sunday Life revealed last weekend how First Minister Arlene Foster and deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill have allocated a further £10m of public cash to phase two of the CIT project, having already thrown £12m at phase one.

Whatsapp CASH INCENTIVE: Arlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill have signed off a further £10m to the controversial CIT fund for paramilitaries

The spend has been branded ""incredible"" by politicians as the budget allocation was confirmed in the same week of the worst sectarian rioting seen in Northern Ireland in a decade - violence which several loyalist leaders encouraged.

CIT's core objective is to help paramilitaries 'transition' into community roles, and the project involves several ex-UVF and IRA prisoners.

To aid this 'transition' loyalists and republicans have asked for restrictions not to be placed on them accessing public cash if they are given PSNI references.

This 'possible solution', contained within Executive Office reports, states: ""Any person convicted of a scheduled offence in connection with the affairs of Northern Ireland should be eligible to ask the PSNI for formal confirmation that they have no current involvement with criminal activity, or issues of a security concern for three years or more.

""Formal confirmation should allow them to participate without hindrance in the affairs of any community organisation on the basis of full and equal membership, including employment. This includes the receipt of public money by organisations in which they are employed. It is important to provide support for those who want to transition.""

But the demand has only caused further rows between politicians concerned at which groups will benefit.

Executive Office sources explained how Sunday Life's recent revelations about the £22m CIT fund caused ""mayhem"" within the corridors of power at Stormont.

Hastily arranged meetings last Monday and Tuesday discussed the fallout from our story, and the public perception that government is again throwing millions of pounds at paramilitaries in the hope that they go away.

An insider said: ""Senior people at Stormont are finally coming round to the realisation that the public is not going to tolerate any more money being handed over to convicted paramilitaries or their pet projects.""

MLAs have tabled several urgent questions to the Executive Office on the matter, with People Before Profit's Gerry Carroll asking how many organisations are benefiting from the CIT fund and what criteria they were asked to meet for funding. SDLP Assembly members Colin McGrath and Matthew O'Toole have also filed questions about the multi-million pound scheme.

The big winners from the CIT programme appear to be the republican and loyalist restorative justice groups Community Restorative Justice (CRJ) Ireland and Alternatives NI.

The registered charities, which raked in a combined £1.8m of public money last year, were set up by former IRA and UVF prisoners as a way to deal with neighbourhood disputes without involving the courts.

Both are being funded to roll out restorative justice projects in the eight areas of Northern Ireland which will benefit from the £10m of phase two CIT cash.

Several of these districts - west Belfast, north Belfast, the Shankill and Carrickfergus - were ravaged by recent rioting. This has led to the perception that paramilitaries there are being rewarded for encouraging the violence.

Mrs Foster defended the CIT scheme at a press conference last Wednesday, and dismissed any suggestion rioters or paramilitaries are being bought off. An Executive Office spokeswoman said: ""A budget of £10m has been allocated for the next three years as an initial contribution to the Communities in Transition initiative which will run until March 2024.

""A range of Phase 1 projects have already been extended to 30 June 2021. It is the intention of the Executive Office that Phase 2 of the programme will commence from 1 July 2021.""

A Spanish court has provoked outrage by acquitting a man of sexually abusing his 14-year-old stepdaughter despite the fact she gave birth to his child.

The Pamplona court accepted the defendant's claim the teenager initiated the encounter and he had no recollection of it as he had been very drunk that night.

Close to nine months later, in December 2018, the girl was admitted to hospital and gave birth to a child, something the accused claimed had been a complete surprise to him and the girl's mother.

Social services ordered a paternity test, which confirmed the stepfather was the father of the baby.

The girl's mother reported the father for alleged sexual abuse of her daughter, who initially said she had been raped in the street before changing her story to corroborate her stepfather's claim he had not been conscious when they had sex.

The judges, sitting in the same Pamplona court that in 2018 sparked massive protests when acquitting the ""wolf pack"" gang rapists who were later found guilty on appeal, said that there was insufficient evidence to convict the stepfather.

However, the sentence also noted the girl had ""kept her head and eyes facing down"" during the trial, ""answering questions very briefly in a barely audible voice"".

Altamira Gonzalo, vice-president of the Themis women jurists' association, said the verdict ""takes us back to the kind of sentences we used to see in Spain in the 1950s or 60s, when there was complete impunity for men in the family environment"".

""The sentence beggars belief. The only thing the court valued is the accused's right to the presumption of innocence. It has ignored its duty to protect a minor and the fact that the age of consent in Spain is 16,"" Gonzalo told The Telegraph.

Spain's parliament this week passed a new child protection law backed by NGOs such as Save the Children, which estimates only 15 per cent of family abuse cases in Spain are reported.

Cira Garcia, a judge from one of Spain's gender violence courts, said the sentence does not even consider the possibility the girl may have changed her version of events in order to protect her stepfather.

""We are sick of criticising that children's testimony is often not given credibility and they are accused of lying in court, but here the girl's word is accepted without question to absolve the accused, even though her account of events is absolutely implausible,"" Garcia told the online newspaper Publico.

0,New Zealand wants to ban cigarette sales to anyone born after 2004 as part of plan to make nation ‘smoke free’ by 2025,https://www.rt.com/news/521201-new-zealand-cigarettes-smoking-ban/,"New Zealand is currently mulling a series of proposals aimed at eliminating smoking in the country, including a radical initiative that would prohibit the sale of tobacco to an entire generation.

Under the country’s Smokefree Aotearoa 2025 Action Plan, New Zealand hopes to gradually increase the legal smoking age and ultimately prohibit cigarette sales to anyone born after 2004. The initiative also calls for a significant reduction in the level of nicotine allowed in tobacco and places restrictions on where cigarettes can be sold. The government would also set a minimum price for all tobacco products.

As the name of the plan suggests, the goal is to phase out tobacco use in the country over the next few years, creating a “smoke free” New Zealand by 2025. The country’s Health Ministry explained that while smoking rates have declined over the past decade, “much work still needs to be done,” particularly to reduce tobacco use among “Maori, Pacific peoples and those living in our most disadvantaged communities.”

New Zealanders have been invited to “provide feedback” about the action plan, which was formally released on Thursday. Residents will have until May 31 to share their thoughts on the matter before it enters the next phase towards becoming law.

Also on rt.com New Zealand PM urges public to ‘call out’ family & friends who break Covid-19 rules, who let down ‘team of five million’

Associate Health Minister Ayesha Verrall said that around 4,500 New Zealanders die each year from tobacco-related ailments and that the government was committed to “accelerated progress” in its fight against smoking.

“We need a new approach… Business-as-usual without a tobacco control program won’t get us there,” Verall argued.

While the initiative has been hailed by some advocacy groups, it is not without its critics. Some have warned that limiting the sale of tobacco would bankrupt shop owners. The restrictions could also fuel an unregulated black market for tobacco products. The government has even acknowledged that the amount of tobacco products smuggled into the country has “increased substantially” in recent years.

Due to launch in October 2021 after years of delays, the new cutting-edge telescope could allow humanity to detect life signs on distant planets in as little as 60 hours, according to early calculations.

“What really surprised me about the results is that we may realistically find signs of life on other planets in the next 5 to 10 years,” said Caprice Phillips, a graduate student at the Ohio State University.

“Humankind has contemplated the questions, ‘Are we alone? What is life? Is life elsewhere similar to us?’” Phillips says.

“My research suggests that for the first time, we have the scientific knowledge and technological capabilities to realistically begin to find the answers to these questions.”

The JWST will peer into the distant past by observing far-away galaxies and other remote objects out in the wider universe, so even if it doesn’t find alien lifesigns right away, it will help humanity answer other fundamental questions about the origin and nature of the universe.

0,France finally outlaws sex with children under 15 after Duhamel-Kouchner incest scandal reignites age-of-consent debate,https://www.rt.com/news/521197-france-bans-sex-children/,"French lawmakers have adopted a law cracking down on sex with children and incest, following a social media firestorm touched off by allegations of incestuous abuse against a prominent intellectual earlier this year.

The Assemblee Nationale voted unanimously on Thursday to set the age of consent at 15, classifying sex with children under that age – as well as incestuous sex with anyone under 18 – as rape, punishable by up to 20 years in prison.

“This is a historic law for our children and our society,” Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti told lawmakers, adding that it sends a clear message that “children are off-limits.”

The law also includes tougher penalties on internet pedophilia, with anyone caught grooming children under 15 online facing 10 years in prison and a €150,000 (approximately $180,000) fine. Previously, French prosecutors could only bring charges of rape or sexual assault if they could prove an adult forced, threatened or tricked a minor into sex.

Also on rt.com France drops plan to set age of sexual consent at 15, triggering outrage & confusion

The new law did carve out an exemption for consensual relations between a minor and a young adult up to five years older – a so-called 'Romeo and Juliet' clause, named after the teens in William Shakespeare’s famous tragedy. Dupond-Moretti defended its inclusion, saying he did not want “to put a youth of 18 on trial because he had consensual sex with a girl aged fourteen-and-a-half.”

A previous attempt by French lawmakers to set the age of consent floundered in 2018. It was inspired by the case of a 28-year-old who was caught having sex with an 11-year-old girl, but was initially not charged with rape. The new law was driven in part by a book published in January this year, however.

In ‘La Familia Grande’, Camille Kouchner accused her stepfather Olivier Duhamel of having abused her twin brother for years, starting when he was 14. She also claimed her mother’s “leftist intellectual friends” – as France24 put it – knew about the abuse, but kept it quiet. The conspiracy of silence apparently included her own father, former foreign minister and Doctors Without Borders (MSF) co-founder Bernard Kouchner.

Duhamel, a prominent political scientist and TV pundit, has since resigned from public life. Earlier this week, French media reported he had confessed to the abuse to police.

Kouchner’s book prompted a Twitter user to publish their own accusation of incestuous abuse with a hashtag #MeTooInceste, which has since gone viral in France.

“Due to the serious threats to French interests in Pakistan, French nationals and French companies are recommended to temporarily leave the country,” read the letter from the French embassy to its citizens in Pakistan on Thursday.

The move comes after a week of intense protests against French interests in the country, with radical Islamist party Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan paralyzing the country's two largest cities, Lahore and Karachi, as well as the capital Islamabad, demanding the expulsion of the ambassador of France.

The group, which was banned on Wednesday under the Anti-Terrorism Act, has made the issue of “blasphemy” its rallying cry. Since November, it has called for the expulsion of the French ambassador and a ban on all French goods following President Emmanuel Macron’s vocal support for freedom of expression and his refusal to condemn the showing of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed.

In November, the group blocked highways and called on the government to consider its demands. The organization threatened to restart protests on April 20 if the government had not met its demands, but the arrest of its leader on Monday by Pakistani authorities triggered a new wave of demonstrations.

Liaison Office Director Luo Huining gave no details but said Beijing has always been “true to its word and resolute in its deeds” in ensuring national security.

“Now that we have a law, a mechanism, and a team, the implementation is ever more important,” said Luo. “For all who endanger national security, hard resistance should be stricken down by law, soft resistance should be regulated by law.”

More than 100 people have been arrested since Beijing in June last year imposed a national security law on Hong Kong, mandating punishments of up to life imprisonment. The Chinese and Hong Kong governments say foreign forces conspired to encourage the months-long anti-government protests in 2019, a claim denied by pan-democrats.

Some western nations have imposed sanctions on mainland and Hong Kong officials in response to the security legislation and a sweeping political overhaul designed to ensure only “patriots” rule Hong Kong.

In a rare public appearance at the ceremony, Director of the Office for Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong Zheng Yanxiong thanked the legal sector for its support: “I have to especially thank the friends in the legal sector who resolutely supported the implementation of the national security law,” said Zheng.

“Judges, prosecutors, lawyers, and scholars, they all made professional contributions by speaking justly and acting proactively in legal events, with the moral recognition of national security, a serious attitude towards the rule of law, and legal responsibility towards social order.”

Zheng, who was appointed director in July last year, was known for a hardline approach that stamped out anti-corruption protests in Wukan, a village in Guangdong province, in 2011.

Zheng also described the Hong Kong administration, especially the disciplined services, as the city’s “guardian angels” in maintaining national security and prosperity.

Legislative efforts ‘demonised’

In her opening speech, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said national security and regime security were inseparable. “To genuinely secure national security, the right to rule must be tightly gripped in the hands of patriots.”

Lam said legislative efforts to maintain national security had been “demonised by individuals with ulterior motives” since the 1997 handover, making Hong Kong a gap in China’s national security.

Meanwhile, Most of Hong Kong’s newspapers carried front-page government advertisements promoting Thursday’s National Security Education Day, with the exception of the pro-democracy Apple Daily.

The sometimes-violent protests which gripped the city for months in 2019 and early 2020 have subsided since the start of the Covid pandemic and the passing of the National Security Law. Meetings of more than four people are still banned under pandemic regulations.

But the League of Social Democrats and the Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China staged a four-person protest in Wan Chai demanding full democracy. They also called for political prisoners to be released and for human rights to be respected.",533,3506,19,122

Kobili Traoré killed an Orthodox Jewish woman in 2018 by throwing her off her balcony in Paris.

France's top court has ruled that he will not go on trial because he was in a drug-induced psychosis.

Cannabis was found in Traoré's blood after he was taken into custody for the killing.

France's top court ruled on Wednesday that the killer of an elderly Jewish woman will not go on trial, France24 reported.

Kobili Traoré admitted to murdering his neighbor, Sarah Halimi, in 2017. He shouted ""Allahu Akbar,"" or ""God is great"" in Arabic, and ""I killed the devil,"" shortly before throwing her off the balcony of her third-floor Paris apartment, The New York Times said.

On Wednesday, the Court of Cassation - France's final court of appeal - affirmed two prior judgments that ruled that Traoré could not be held criminally responsible for his actions because he was in a state of drug-induced psychosis.

Traoré, a drug dealer, smoked pot every day for 13 years and had up to 15 joints a day, Israel Hayom reported. Toxicological analysis revealed the presence of cannabis in his blood on the day he was arrested, the French newspaper Libération said.

The court noted that ""a person is not criminally responsible if suffering, at the time of the event, from psychic or neuropsychic disturbance that has eliminated all discernment or control,"" The Times said.

Whether the disturbance was brought on through voluntary drug use is not a legally important distinction, the court said.

In December 2019, President Emmanuel Macron made a rare intervention by criticizing the Paris appeals court for saying that Traore was unfit for trial.

""Even if, in the end, the judge decided that there was no criminal responsibility, there is a need for a trial,"" Macron said in 2020.

The country's top magistrates then criticized Macron for impacting the ""independence of the justice system,"" The Times of Israel reported.

The ruling has angered French politicians and France's Jewish community, the largest in Europe.

Dozens of French senators have reacted by proposing a revision to the law that exonerates a crime due to a drug-induced psychosis, The New York Times said.

Dr. Arūnas Bubnys was nominated for the post on Wednesday by Viktorija Čmilytė-Nielsen, the Speaker of Lithuania’s parliament, the Seimas.

According to the biography of Bubnys on the LGGRTC’s website, the “most important trends of his work” focus upon “anti-Nazi resistance in Lithuania in 1941–1944, the Polish underground in Lithuania in WWII, and holocaust (sic) in Lithuania.”

However, experts on the slaughter of nearly 200,000 Jews in Lithuania — the overwhelming majority — during the Nazi Holocaust decried the appointment of Bubnys, charging him with glorifying the pro-German puppet regime that ruled following the Nazi invasion of 1941, as well as deliberately minimizing the role played by Lithuanian collaborators during the Holocaust.

Related coverage Federal Prosecutors Ask Court to Keep Nazi-Sympathizing Capitol Rioter in Jail Due to Threat to New Jersey Jewish Community US Justice Department prosecutors, in a court filing on Friday, said that a known Nazi sympathizer and army reservist who...

“For years Dr. Bubnys has participated in the glorification of the outbreak of the Lithuanian Holocaust on 23 June 1941,” observed the website Defending History, which closely monitors the politically-charged environment around the study of the Holocaust in Lithuania and other eastern European countries.

In June 2020, Bubnys addressed a public meeting in which he effusively praised Jonas Noreika, a Lithuanian independence advocate and military general who participated in the mass murder of Jews in the summer of 1941, and Kazys Škirpa, a founder of the wartime-era Lithuanian Activist Front (LAF) whose writings advocated the ethnic cleansing of Lithuania’s Jewish citizens. The two men are among the many anti-Soviet, nationalist politicians of that period whose reputations have been rehabilitated by the Lithuanian government over the previous 20 years.

According to Defending History, Bubnys “has also glorified the Nazi puppet ‘provisional government’ of the summer of 1941, and has consistently downgraded local Holocaust collaboration while seeking wherever possible to blame the ‘Jewish police’ for the horrors of the Vilna, Kovno, and Shavl (Šiauliai) ghettos, in the period after the murder of the Jewish residents of all of the hundreds of smaller communities [in Lithuania] in the second half of 1941.”",389,2594,16,124

O plánovaném vyhoštění ruských diplomatů, kteří musí území České republiky opustit do 48 hodin byl už informován i prezident Miloš Zeman. „Prezident nám vyjádřil absolutní podporu,“ zdůraznil Babiš. „Česká republika je svrchovaný stát a musí odpovídajícím způsobem reagovat,“ prohlásil premiér.

„Prezident republiky byl o případu informován panem předsedou vlády i panem vicepremiérem v průběhu soboty. Prezident republiky tedy veškeré informace má k dispozici. Nejvyšší ústavní činitelé postupují v součinnosti,“ uvedl Zemanův mluvčí Jiří Ovčáček.

Před společným vystoupením s Babišem si Hamáček předvolal ruského velvyslance Alexandra Zmejevského.

Babiš o incidentu a vyhoštění ruských diplomatů mluvil v sobotu večer i se šéfem Evropské rady Charlesem Michelem. Partnery v Evropské unii chce podrobně informovat na příštím summitu, uvedl premiér večer na Twitteru.

„Česko se tímto oznámením přihlásilo k ostrému kurzu vůči Rusku. Je ale otázkou, kdy se tato informace dostala k vládním představitelům, protože vyšetřování probíhalo delší dobu a údajně se záležitost měla projednávat před čtrnácti dny ve zpravodajském výboru,“ poukázal Miroslav Mareš z katedry politologie na Masarykově univerzitě na načasování českého oznámení.

Česká policie zároveň po vystoupení Babiše a Hamáčka oznámila, že kvůli výbuchu ve Vrběticích hledá dva muže.

Portál Lidovky.cz uvedl s odkazem na zdroje blízké vyšetřování, že muži hledaní NCOZ se do areálu ve Vrběticích dostali už 15. října, den před výbuchem, a nastražili tam výbušné zařízení. To však explodovalo dříve, než plánovali, zabít zřejmě mělo někoho, komu byla určena dodávka zbraní, uvedly Lidovky.

Terčem pro GRU podle mezinárodní investigativní skupiny Bellingcat byl jeden z významných bulharských obchodníků se zbraněmi Emilian Gebrev, kterého se na Balkáně údajně pokusili členové ruské rozvědky dvakrát otrávit.



Podle portálu Seznam Zprávy se ruská rozvědka GRU zaměřila na Vrbětice kvůli válce v Sýrii, kam měla údajně munice z vrbětického skladu směřovat. Podle vyšetřovatelů mohlo jít o sabotáž, aby munice ze skladu nemohla putovat k Američanům, kteří tak chtěli pomoci povstalcům v Sýrii bojujícím proti syrskému prezidentovi Bašáru Asadovi, napsal portál. Rusové naopak Asadův režim podporovali.



Při výbuchu ve Vrběticích zahynuli dva lidé

Jeden sklad ve Vrběticích vybuchl v říjnu 2014, druhý v prosinci téhož roku. Při prvním výbuchu zemřeli dva lidé. Sklady si pronajímala ostravská firma Imex Group. Policie exploze vyšetřuje jako úmyslné obecné ohrožení. Munice uložená v dalších skladech byla z Vrbětic odvezena.



Podle premiéra Babiše existuje „důvodné podezření o zapojení důstojníků ruské vojenské zpravodajské služby GRU, jednotky 29155“ do výbuchu muničního skladu ve Vrběticích.



Při výbuších bylo zasaženo 1319 hektarů půdy, z toho zhruba 341 hektarů přímo v areálu. Většinu pozemků už mají zpět v užívání jejich majitelé. V budoucnu by měly získat všechny pozemky a objekty v areálu do svého majetku Vojenské lesy a statky ČR, které na nich plánují hospodařit. (shrnutí dění kolem výbuchu čtěte zde)

The delegate referred to the largest seizure of wood in the history of Brazil. In the document, the police official says that Salles hampered environmental inspection and sponsors private interests.

Saraiva cites evidence of two crimes: administrative advocacy and preventing or hindering investigation of criminal offenses involving a criminal organization.

The Federal Police and Salles have been battling since the day the minister decided to visit the place where the wood was seized, in Pará. At the site, he did some type of verification of the operation and returned a week later, when he participated in a meeting with the owners of the material.

Saraiva told Folha that this is the first time that the minister of the Environment has actively undermined an operation that seeks to preserve the Amazon rainforest.

COVAX conundrum

NEW DELHI: After gifting and selling tens of millions of Covid-19 vaccine doses abroad, India suddenly finds itself short of shots as new infections surge in the world's second-most populous country.India breached 200,000 daily infections for the first time on Thursday, and is trying to inoculate more of its population using domestically produced shots.Facing soaring cases and overflowing hospitals after lockdown restrictions were eased, it also abruptly changed the rules to allow it to fast-track vaccine imports, having earlier rebuffed foreign drugmakers like Pfizer.It will import Russia's Sputnik V vaccine starting this month to cover as many as 125 million people.The reversal in fortunes could hamper not only India's battle to contain the pandemic, but also vaccination campaigns in more than 60 poorer countries, mainly in Africa, for months.The COVAX programme, backed by the World Health Organization and Gavi vaccine alliance, aims at equitable vaccine access around the world, and is relying heavily on supplies from India, Asia's pharmaceutical powerhouse.But so far this month India has only exported around 1.2 million vaccine doses. That compares with 64 million doses shipped abroad between late January and March, according to data from the foreign ministry.An official with knowledge of India's vaccine strategy said that available shots would be used domestically while the country faced an ""emergency situation"".""There is no commitment to other countries,"" he said.India's foreign ministry, which oversees vaccine deals with other countries, said last week that Indian demand would dictate the level of exports.Resulting shortages are already being felt in some countries in the COVAX scheme, and a UN health official involved in the vaccine rollout in Africa said: ""To be so reliant on one manufacturer is a massive concern.""The director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, said earlier this month delays in supplies from India could be ""catastrophic"".Four sources involved in discussions on vaccine supplies and procurement said factors including delays by India and COVAX in placing firm orders, a lack of investment in production, raw material shortages and underestimating the coronavirus surge at home had contributed to vaccine shortages.The Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's biggest vaccine manufacturer, had vowed to deliver at least 2 billion Covid-19 shots to low and middle-income countries, with nearly half of that by the end of 2021.But it has also come under pressure to meet the needs of other governments, including Britain, Canada and Saudi Arabia, amid AstraZeneca's global production problems.The United States, meanwhile, ring-fenced the supply of key equipment and raw materials for its own vaccine makers, limiting SII's operations and delaying by months its goal of raising monthly output to 100 million from up to 70 million now, said one of the sources.A further initial hurdle to SII's supply ambitions was India's hesitation in placing firm orders, two sources said.That could have allowed it to boost output of the AstraZeneca vaccine early, even though regulators had yet to approve it.India spent months discussing the final price per dose, and inked an initial purchase order roughly two weeks after India's drug regulator approved the AstraZeneca shot, according to the sources.At one point, SII ran out of space to store produced doses.""That is why I chose not to pack more than 50 million doses, because I knew if I packed more than that, I would have to store it in my house,"" SII Chief Executive Adar Poonawalla told Reuters in January.He said he had spent 20 billion rupees ($272 million) on the 50 million doses that the company started stockpiling since around October.Even now, the government only makes ad-hoc purchases from SII instead of agreeing a longer-term supply schedule, said one of the sources.SII has sought more than $400 million from the government to increase capacity, but no commitment has yet been made.The health department and foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment on issues of funding, purchasing delays and other aspects of India's vaccination rollout.COVAX also did not green-light shipments to participating countries from SII until after the shot received WHO clearance in mid-February, said a source involved in the COVAX initiative.The source said those delays meant tens of millions of additional doses that the SII could have produced between October and February never materialised.Gavi defended its decision to wait for proper approvals before going ahead with firm orders. And while it is looking for more suppliers, it conceded that much still depended on India's vaccine makers who account for some 60% of global supplies.COVAX has a deal to buy 1 billion-plus doses from the SII. But it has received less than a fifth of the 100 million or so doses of the SII-made AstraZeneca vaccine it had expected by May. SII is also supposed to make millions of doses of the Novavax shot for COVAX.Gavi had hoped SII would fully resume vaccine deliveries to COVAX in May, but on Wednesday it said India's Covid-19 crisis could affect that.""We understand the ferocity of the virus in India at the current time, nevertheless we hope and expect deliveries to resume as soon as possible,"" it said in an email to Reuters.On Thursday India reported 200,739 infections over the past 24 hours, a seventh daily record in the last eight days, while 1,038 deaths took its toll to 173,123. Its tally of 14.1 million infections is second only to the United States.Having originally aimed to cover 300 million of its highest-risk people by August, or just over a fifth of its 1.35 billion population, the government has now expanded that by another 100 million, with the promise to widen it further.",929,5873,22,126

This advisory is being released alongside the U.S. government’s formal attribution of the SolarWinds supply chain compromise and related cyber-espionage campaign.

We are publishing this product to highlight additional tactics, techniques, and procedures being used by SVR so that network defenders can take action to mitigate against them.

Mitigation against these vulnerabilities is critically important as U.S. and allied networks are constantly scanned, targeted, and exploited by Russian state-sponsored cyber actors. In addition to compromising the SolarWinds Orion software supply chain, recent SVR activities include targeting COVID-19 research facilities via WellMess malware and targeting networks through the VMware vulnerability disclosed by NSA.

This was highlighted in NSA’s Cybersecurity Advisory, “Russian State-Sponsored Actors Exploiting Vulnerability in Workspace ONE Access Using Compromised Credentials.”

NSA, CISA, and FBI strongly encourage all cybersecurity stakeholders to check their networks for indicators of compromise related to all five vulnerabilities and the techniques detailed in the advisory and to urgently implement associated mitigations.

NSA, CISA, and FBI also recognize all partners in the private and public sectors for comprehensive and collaborative efforts to respond to recent Russian activity in cyberspace.

NSA encourages its customers to mitigate against the following publicly known vulnerabilities:

Washington: The Biden administration announced Thursday the US is expelling 10 Russian diplomats and imposing sanctions against several dozen people and companies, holding the Kremlin accountable for interference in last year's presidential election and the hacking of federal agencies.

The sweeping measures are meant to punish Russia for actions that US officials say cut to the core of American democracy and to deter future acts by imposing economic costs on Moscow, including by targeting its ability to borrow money. The sanctions are certain to exacerbate tensions with Russia, which promised a response, even as President Joe Biden said the administration could have taken even more punitive measures but chose not to in the interests of maintaining stability.

“We cannot allow a foreign power to interfere in our democratic process with impunity,” Biden said at the White House.

Sanctions against six Russian companies that support the country's cyber efforts represent the first retaliatory measures against the Kremlin for the hack familiarly known as the SolarWinds breach, with the US explicitly linking the intrusion to the SVR, a Russian intelligence agency. Though such intelligence-gathering missions are not uncommon, officials said they were determined to respond because of the operation's broad scope and the high cost of the intrusion on private companies.

The US also announced sanctions on 32 individuals and entities accused of attempting to influence last year’s presidential election, including by spreading disinformation. US officials alleged in a declassified report last month that Russian President Vladimir Putin authorised influence operations to help Donald Trump in his unsuccessful bid for reelection as president, though there’s no evidence Russia or anyone else changed votes or manipulated the outcome.

The actions, foreshadowed by the administration for weeks, signal a harder line against Putin, whom Trump was reluctant to criticise even as his administration pursued sanctions against Moscow. They are the administration’s second major foreign policy move in two days, following the announcement of troop withdrawals from Afghanistan. Until now, Biden has largely focused on the coronavirus pandemic and economy in his first months in office.

Biden said that when he advised Putin days earlier of the forthcoming measures — which included expulsion of the 10 diplomats, some of them representatives of Russian intelligence services — he told the Russian leader “that we could have gone further but I chose not to do so. I chose to be proportionate.""

“We want,” he said, “a stable, predictable relationship.”

Even so, Russian officials spoke of a swift response, with Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov warning that “a series of retaliatory measures will come in the nearest time.""

Other American measures are expected, though the administration is not likely to announce them. Officials have advised that their response to Russia would be in ways both seen and unseen.

The sanctions are the latest in a series of actions that successive presidential administrations have taken to counter Russian behavior seen as antagonistic. It is unclear whether the new US actions will result in changed behavior, especially since past measures — both Trump and Barack Obama expelled individual diplomats during their presidencies — have failed to bring an end to Russian hacking.

But experts suggest this latest round, even while not guaranteed to curb cyberattacks, might have more resonance because of its financial impact: The order makes it more difficult for Russia to borrow money by barring U.S. banks from buying Russian bonds directly from the Russian Central Bank, Russian National Wealth Fund and Finance Ministry. It could complicate Russian efforts to raise capital and give companies pause about doing business in Russia.

The impact of the sanctions and the US willingness to impose costs will be weighed by Putin, though he is unlikely to make “a 180” degree pivot in his behavior, said Daniel Fried, a former assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs.

“The issue is, how can we push back against Putin’s aggression, while at the same time keeping open channels of communication and continuing to cooperate with Russia in areas of mutual interest,” Fried said. “And it seems to me the Biden administration has done a pretty good job framing up the relationship in exactly this way.”

Eric Lorber, a former Treasury Department official now with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the administration, is “surely trying to balance putting pressure on Russia, pushing back on Russia, while at the same time, not engaging in full-fledged economic warfare.”

The White House did not impose sanctions related to separate reports that Russia encouraged the Taliban to attack US and allied troops in Afghanistan, saying instead that Biden was using diplomatic, military and intelligence channels to respond.

Reports of alleged “bounties” surfaced last year, with the Trump administration drawing criticism for not raising the issue directly with Russia. Administration officials said Thursday they had only low to moderate confidence in that intelligence, in part because of the ways in which the information was obtained, including from interrogations of Afghan detainees.

Among the companies sanctioned are websites US officials say operate as fronts for Russian intelligence agencies and spread disinformation, including articles alleging widespread voter fraud in 2020. The individuals who were targeted include Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian and Ukrainian political consultant who worked with former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and who was indicted in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.

The Treasury Department said Thursday that Kilimnik had provided “sensitive information on polling and campaign strategy” to Russian intelligence services. That went further than Mueller's office, which said in 2019 that it had been unable to determine what Kilimnik had done with the polling data after getting it from the Trump campaign.

Also sanctioned were the Kremlin’s first deputy chief of staff, Alexei Gromov, several individuals linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman with close ties to Russia's president, nicknamed “Putin’s chef” for serving Kremlin functions, and several front companies the US says helped Prigozhin evade sanctions imposed earlier.

The US also sanctioned eight individuals and entities tied to Russia’s occupation in Crimea.

Biden informed Putin that the sanctions were coming earlier this week. Administration officials have made clear in their contacts with the Russia side that they are hoping to avoid a “downward spiral” in the relationship, according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity following the sanctions announcement.

The two leaders had a tense call in which Biden told Putin to “de-escalate tensions” following a Russian military buildup on Ukraine’s border, and said the US would “act firmly in defense of its national interests” regarding Russian intrusions and election interference.

In a television interview last month, Biden replied “I do” when asked if he thought Putin was a “killer.” He said the days of the US “rolling over” to Putin were done. Putin later recalled his ambassador to the US and pointed at the US history of slavery and slaughtering Native Americans and the atomic bombing of Japan in World War II.

0,France complicit in Boko Haram/ ISWAP threats to Nigeria’s sovereignty - CATE reveals in a letter to Ambassador - Vanguard News,https://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/07/france-complicit-in-boko-haram-iswap-threats-to-nigerias-sovereignty-cate-reveals-in-a-letter-to-ambassador/,"Kindly Share This Story:

The Coalition Against Terrorism and Extremism (CATE) has warned France that its sabotage and sponsorship of Boko Haram/ISWAP activities in Nigeria poses a threat to the country’s sovereignty.

CATE made this known in an open letter signed by its National Co-ordinator, Gabriel Onoja, on Monday and addressed to France Ambassador to Nigeria, Jérôme Pasquier.

Also read:

According to Onoja, the European nation alongside its former colonies are frustrating Nigeria’s counter-terrorism efforts over the crude oil and mineral deposits found in the Lake Chad Basin.

“We decided to pen down this open epistle to you and by implication, the French Government to express our deep concerns over some suspected developments, actions or inactions by the government of your country in the festering Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) terrorism in Nigeria, particularly in the Northeast region,” Onoja wrote on behalf of CATE.

“We dare submit that wittingly, Nigeria’s war against terrorism is greatly hampered for lack of adequate cooperation or outright sabotage of its efforts by her neighbouring countries, the former colonies of France.

” The game plan is to keep the Lake Chad Basin area permanently unsecured for Nigeria to be unable to embark on crude oil prospecting on its own side of the Lake Chad and legitimate boundaries; while the same resources are illegally or stealthily tapped by partners in this criminal cartel.”

CATE said it is disappointed with France’s “lukewarm posture” to terrorist activities, adding that the country’s silence is a sign of guilt.

The group recalled how the French failed alliance with its ex-colonies almost jeopardized Nigeria’s progress and the European nation’s failure to prosecute eight of its nationals fighting on the side of Boko Haram since 2017.

“In 2017, France organized a security summit to discuss Boko Haram. And months later, it launched the G5 Sahel Force at a conference with French President Emmanuel Marcon in attendance together with leaders of Niger, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Burkina Faso. Shortly after the French Summit on Boko Haram, remnants of the sect which escaped from Nigeria into Niger and Chad bounced back stronger to launch attacks on Nigeria,” Onoja stated.

“There were strong indications that the Nigerian Military decimated Boko Haram to near defeat in 2017. But curiously, the sect resurged suddenly after the formation of G5 Sahel Force, and with attacks from their safe havens in France’s former colonies, but not a whisper was heard from the French Government as a reprimand.

“Strangely too, Nigeria’s militia fighting Boko Haram is known as the Civilian JTF, Internally Displaced Persons and several survivors of Boko Haram attacks admitted through eyewitnesses narratives the airdrop of supplies to the terrorists across Nigeria’s borders with her francophone neighbours of Cameroon, Chad and Niger, a violation of the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy stipulations endorsed by all member-states.

“Several security experts and analysts, as well as intelligence reports, have fingered Chad and Niger as offering transit routes through their countries’ borders for the movement of a large cache of arms and ammunition to Boko Haram insurgents. It is the weapons supplies that embolden Boko Haram atrocities in Nigeria, but France is suspiciously silent over the development by her former colonies.

“CATE is also concerned that the French Government refused to prosecute eight French nationals fighting on the side of Boko Haram and were ‘mistakenly’ arrested by Cameroonian forces in 2015.‎ The serving French Foreign Minister at that time, Mr. Lauren Fabuci ordered Cameroun to transfer the suspects to France for presumed prosecution. But thereafter, the suspects are not known to have been subjected to any trial by the French Government in contravention of international laws on counter-terrorism.”

“In the face of these consistent worthy allegations in the public domain, the silence of France is not golden or possibly, an acquiesce of guilt. Therefore, we write to seek explanations to these allegations on France’s alleged complicity in sponsoring terrorism in Nigeria. The silence of France is the reason experts are holding strongly to the verdict that France is behind Boko Haram terrorism in Nigeria. ”

CATE, however, warned France to quit the silence and genuinely support Nigeria to flush out of Boko Haram remnants for the “utmost benefits to citizens of both countries who share a very close affinity that dates back to centuries to decisively work together to defeat Boko Haram terrorists”.

The vaccine is not only being used in India, but exported to a number of countries.Poonawalla had earlier admitted that SII has been facing problems in sending out required number of batches of vaccines due to the bureaucratic and government-related hurdles.Tagging the twitter handle of the President of the United States, Poonawalla said in a tweet, ""Respected @POTUS, if we are to truly unite in beating this virus, on behalf of the vaccine industry outside the US, I humbly request you to lift the embargo of raw material exports out of the U.S. so that vaccine production can ramp up.

It is now readily available online.

Keeping their identities anonymous, the hackers have sent emails to Navalny's supporters, threatening to use their email addresses to gather extra information, before eventually selling the database to advertising companies. The leaked file contains 529,570 different addresses, although many of them have not been verified.

The website, set up on March 23, aims to collect information about 500,000 Navalny backers, with the aim of mobilizing an extensive database once they hit the figure. To sign up, a supporter just needs to enter their location, which can be either their house or street, and an email address. Once the email is confirmed, the person is placed on an interactive map, which currently has 440,217 people.

The initiative, set up by Navalny's right-hand man, Lithuania-based Leonid Volkov, seeks to show the authorities that a considerable number of Russians are behind the opposition figure. The hackers, however, aren't very happy about the idea.

""Keep participating in the movement of this IT wizz Volkov, and we'll keep getting new data about you, haha,"" the email, sent to the entire database, cajoled. ""In the meantime, we'll start de-anonymizing emails, and soon we'll know your names, addresses, phone numbers. Next, we'll sell your data to advertising companies.""

Ivan Zhdanov, director of Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, confirmed the hack as real, but assured those on the database that their only listed data is their email address. The Anti-Corruption Foundation is listed by the Ministry of Justice as a Foreign Agent.

Writing on the Team Navalny telegram channel, Zhdanov suggested that the issue lies with the third-party service used to send out communications.

""The biggest mean thing malicious users can do is to send you a nasty email, which will probably end up in spam,"" he said. ""We apologize for the trouble caused.""

This is not the first time Navalny supporters have had their information exposed online. In February, Moscow daily Kommersant wrote that an archive of personal information about 28,000 people was leaked on the web, including telephone numbers.

The opposition figure is currently in prison after being judged to have broken the terms of a suspended sentence, handed to him in 2014 due to a case involving French company Yves Rocher.

Confusion after St. Vincent PM says only those with Covid jab can flee VOLCANO on cruise ships,https://www.rt.com/news/520696-vincent-volcano-evacuation-vaccinated/?fbclid=IwAR1_rrswdaRbRL2NeoPZEa-vCeGKhlvmVr3dGPRyL15oI4J8fgt-jk_baq8,"As a volcanic eruption cast a pall of ash over the Caribbean island of St. Vincent, tens of thousands fled – but eyebrows were raised after the island nation’s PM said they weren’t going anywhere without a Covid shot.

The La Soufriere volcano on the eastern Caribbean island of St. Vincent erupted on Friday, sending a column of ash 10km into the sky. With some 16,000 people living in the ‘red zone’ near the volcano, the authorities had been scrambling to put together evacuation plans in the hours leading up to the blast.

For viewers following the evacuation effort through television news reports, one detail of the plan may have stood out. “Cruise ships are evacuating people from the island,” CBS News’ Norah O’Donnell announced on Friday, adding that “only those vaccinated against Covid” would be allowed to leave.

INSANE: “Cruise ships are evacuating people from the island, but only those vaccinated against covid.”What in the hell pic.twitter.com/FuKq3IU1i7 — Drew Hernandez (@DrewHLive) April 10, 2021

The clip, which has since raised some eyebrows online, turned out to be factually correct. St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ prime minister, Ralph Gonsalves, did announce in a press conference that evacuees would need to receive a Covid shot before boarding any of the two Royal Caribbean cruise ships and two Carnival Cruise Line’s vessels that arrived on Friday.

Furthermore, Gonsalves said that the neighboring islands of St. Lucia, Grenada, Barbados, and Antigua would accept evacuees, but only if they had been vaccinated.

To add to the horror on St Vincent, *only vaccinated* evacuees are being accepted on cruise ships or nearby islands. This is worse than my worst nightmares about vaccine segregation. This has to redouble our determination to NEVER allow covid passes.pic.twitter.com/Q2Zx73bFkN — Silkie Carlo (@silkiecarlo) April 10, 2021

So... a volcano on St Vincent has erupted and cruise ships are evacuating residents in peril, but only if they've been vaccinated for Covid. We're through the looking glass, everybody. — Oliver Smith (@ollysmithtravel) April 10, 2021

However, despite Gonsalves’ announcement, neither Royal Caribbean nor Carnival Cruise Line have mentioned anything about keeping unvaccinated passengers off their ships. Royal Caribbean did say that “all precautions will be taken to protect the health and safety of the crew and passengers who board our ships,” but did not elaborate further. Nor have the governments of the aforementioned islands released any official statements clarifying whether or not they would accept unvaccinated evacuees.

Further complicating matters is the fact that St. Vincent received its first shipment of vaccines only two days before the eruption. Throughout the pandemic, St. Vincent and the Grenadines has recorded only 1,789 cases of Covid-19 and 10 deaths, according to figures from the World Health Organization.

0,"As International Space Station shows signs of falling apart, Putin approves ambitious plan for Russia to make its own replacement",https://www.rt.com/russia/520992-iss-replacement-putin-plan/,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed off on plans for the country to begin the construction of a manned orbital satellite to eventually replace the International Space Station (ISS), which appears to be on its last legs.

In recent years, the ISS has begun to fall apart, with astronauts now frequently discovering cracks. Last week, it was revealed that Russian cosmonauts were still working on plugging a leak first noticed in 2019. The ongoing problems with the international station have prompted Moscow to begin creating a replacement.

Called ROSS, the Russian orbital satellite will consist of three to seven modules and will be able to carry up to four people. Although only approved by Putin on Monday, on the 60th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin’s landmark first human spaceflight, the project has been in the works for some time. Last November, the first deputy designer general for space contractor RSC Energia revealed his belief that Russia needed to get started on a new station, saying the ISS was already falling apart.

“Until 2025, Russia has obligations to participate in the ISS program,” Vladimir Solovyov told the Russian Academy of Sciences. “There are already a number of elements that have been seriously damaged and are out of service. Many of them are not replaceable. After 2025, we predict an avalanche-like failure of numerous elements onboard the ISS.”

Russia has a long history of making its own satellites, with Sputnik 1 being the first to ever be launched into low Earth orbit, all the way back in 1957. In 1986, the Soviets launched a domestically made space station named Mir, which at the time was the largest artificial satellite in orbit.

Last May, Russian space agency Roscomos revealed that the proposed ROSS could be ready for deployment after 2024.

Despite Moscow’s willingness to go it alone, Roscosmos has reaffirmed its commitment to international cooperation in recent months. Earlier this month, Russia signed off on a plan to continue to collaborate with the US in space, and the two nations are due to use each other’s rockets to head into the cosmos. Roscosmos also signed a moon exploration deal with China in March, with the space agency agreeing to share a lunar station with Beijing.

While space has often been a place for international competition, both Washington and Moscow regularly help each other in times of need. For example, earlier this year, American astronauts donated food to their Russian counterparts when supplies from Earth were delayed.

0,France tells its citizens to flee Pakistan as deadly anti-French riots intensify over Emmanuel Macron’s perceived slight on Islam,https://www.rt.com/op-ed/521261-france-pakistan-khan-macron/,"is a UK journalist, ex-Fleet Street editor, financial industry consultant and political communications special advisor in the UK and EU.

is a UK journalist, ex-Fleet Street editor, financial industry consultant and political communications special advisor in the UK and EU.

Pakistan Premier Imran Khan, struggling to stop hardliners from venting their fury, has banned a radical party and pulled the plug on social media. But he’s the one who first lit the fuse and is now paying the price.

When he first waded into the domestic affairs of France, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan probably thought he could rely on the muscle of fellow Muslim leaders, including bellicose Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, to help see off complaints about over-reach.

Also on rt.com Muslim boycott threats and politics play out in attacks on ‘mentally ill’ Macron as he ups the rhetoric against Islamists

However, in just six months, the relationship between Islamabad and Paris has deteriorated to such an extent that French nationals and companies have now been told by their government to leave the Muslim nation “because of the serious threats to French interests in Pakistan”.

Radical Islamists are largely to blame for the escalation of hostilities and mobilised crowds via social media and messaging apps to blockade the country’s two largest cities, Lahore and Karachi, earlier this week.

This forced Khan’s hand and he has had the leader of the hardline political party, Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), arrested. In the violent demonstrations that followed Saad Rizvi’s detention, two police officers were killed. The party, instrumental in stirring up anger against France over satirical caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad published in Charlie Hebdo magazine, has now been banned and its dissolution sought in the country’s Supreme Court.

In a more direct effort to prevent troubleseeking Islamist mobs assembling, the government today also asked the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority to pull the plug on Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube and Telegram nationwide to prevent TLP radicals from winding up others during Friday prayers.

It’s a serious move and shows that the Pakistan leader recognises things have got out of hand. However, he has to take a large share of the blame for things reaching this point.

Tensions were running high across the Islamic world following President Emmanuel Macron’s defence of the publication of caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed and their use in French school lessons which had led to the the decapitation of schoolteacher Samuel Paty last year and a second terrorist attack which left three more people dead in just a matter of days.

Macron’s staunch defence of the French laïcité (secularism) provoked a series of angry Twitter responses from PM Khan, keen to display his Islamic credentials by alleging that the French president had “chosen to encourage Islamophobia by attacking Islam rather than the terrorists who carry out violence.”

And it was that tone which set the cat among the pigeons.

Macron doubled down, tweeting later on the same day: “We will not give in, ever.

We respect all differences in a spirit of peace. We do not accept hate speech and defend reasonable debate.”

Also on rt.com Macron needs the help of Muslim world leaders or France’s tally of decapitated heads will continue to rise

As ill-feeling bubbled along, it was revealed that France had decided not to assist with the upgrade of the 150 Mirage fighter jets that Dassault Aviation had sold to Pakistan, leaving Khan with only half a fleet fit to fly. Similar requests to help upgrade the country’s French-Italian air defence system, along with its three Agosta 90B submarines, were also declined.

The pressure has been building on Pakistan ever since but the radicals are on a roll.

Meanwhile, in Turkey, the redoubtable Erdogan eventually chose a more pragmatic line and patched things up with his French counterpart last month, releasing a statement that both countries “can contribute significantly to stability and peace” and that “Turkey wishes to cooperate with France” in seeking to achieve their mutual aims in Europe, the Caucasus, the Middle East and Africa.

Khan, however, has found it harder to rein in the fury of the TLP and its supporters, who are still seething over what they see as state-sanctioned blasphemy against Islam by France, for which a price must be paid.

The problem for the former international playboy and cricket star who now leads a population of more than 212 million people – including 174 million Muslims – is that he not only lacks the authority of his Turkish friend – with a much smaller population of 82 million – but that the constitutional empowerment of Pakistan’s religion makes it more difficult to pivot when a touch of pragmatism is needed to diffuse a tricky situation.

If the banning of the TLP and the heavy handed restrictions on social media have the desired effect in keeping the radicals from dictating the public mood, Khan might have enough breathing space to start rebuilding his relationship with Macron.

Otherwise he risks being isolated, stuck with a hamstrung military, and being viewed as a Islamist terrorist sympathiser to be kept at arm’s length by the rest of the world’s leaders.

The high-ranking diplomat was nabbed during a meeting with a Russian citizen who allegedly provided him with secret data.

The diplomat, identified as Alexander Sosonyuk, was arrested in Russia's second city on Friday, the Federal Security Service (FSB) said on Friday. The diplomat was detained while having “a meeting with a Russian citizen, during which he received secret information from law enforcement and FSB databases,” the agency said in a statement.

“Such activity is incompatible with the status of a diplomatic worker and is openly hostile towards Russia. The foreign diplomat will be subjected to measures applied under international law,” the FSB added.

While the agency did not elaborate on the fate of Sosonyuk, he’s likely to be declared a persona non grata and expelled from Russia shortly. It also remained unclear whether any other individual, including Sosonyuk’s Russian contact, has been detained in the aftermath of the ill-fated meeting.

Ukraine has acknowledged the incident, rejecting the allegations and accusing Russia of “hostile” behavior.

It declared victory to the world after the first wave passed, and let its guard – and mask – down. The numbers are leaping from day to day at a speed that far outstrips last year’s. The huge election rallies, especially in Bengal, and the Maha Kumbh are almost certain to accelerate the spread of the infection. While it may be more localised in poll-bound states – that, at least, is the hope – there’s a deepening fear among public health officials that the dispersal of the millions who have congregated in Haridwar might act as a national super-spreader. The Prime Minister is to be commended for emphasising – during his recent interaction with chief ministers – the need to intensify testing, even if it results in a spike in caseload.Nowhere is that need for testing on a war-footing greater than in Haridwar today. And that must be followed – without an hour’s delay – by a massive tracing and containment exercise. It’s too late to argue over whether such a massive gathering should have been allowed in the first place. What the Uttarakhand government and the Centre need to do now is act with the greatest urgency in checking the spread of the virus. Once the pilgrims board buses and trains, there’s no saying how many more will be exposed across the length and breadth of the country.

A senior official in the health department confirmed to TOI that a total of 68 “top seers” in Haridwar have tested positive for Covid-19 between April 5 and 14.In the wake of the increasing number of Covid cases in the sadhu community in Haridwar, Niranjani Akhada, one of the largest naga sanyasi akhadas and the second most powerful after the Juna akhada, has announced it will now exit the mela.According to the mela administration , 332 people (of 14,915 tested) reported Covid positive on Thursday. The administration doesn’t have any record of the total number of Covid deaths among those attending the religious fair. Of the 13,415 tested on Wednesday, 119 were positive; 79,301 people were tested since April 12 and 745 found positive.Secretary of the Niranjani Akhada Mahant Ravindra Puri said that “most of the saints and their followers” in the camps at Haridwar have Covid-19 like symptoms due to which saints of the akhada have decided to end the mela from April 17.Director-general of health Dr Tripati Bahuguna said, “The private hospital where Mahamandaleshwar Kapil Dev Das was admitted has shared information with the health department that the seer was admitted to their facility on April 12 and he breathed his last on April 13. He had kidney ailments before Covid-19 struck him. He was undergoing dialysis too.”The place in Kankhal where the seer had been camping houses 10,000 more saints and followers.

Immediately before the release, prosecutors retrated statements that he had a gun.",https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-04-15/chicago-to-release-video-of-cop-fatally-shooting-13-year-old,"Body-camera video released Thursday after public outcry over the Chicago police shooting of a 13-year-old boy shows the youth appearing to drop a handgun and begin raising his hands less than a second before an officer fires his gun and kills him.

A still frame taken from Officer Eric Stillman’s jumpy nighttime body-camera footage shows that Adam Toledo wasn’t holding anything and had his hands up when Stillman shot him in the chest around 3 a.m. March 29. Police, who were responding to reports of shots fired in the area, say the teen had a handgun on him before the shooting. In Stillman’s footage, the officer shines a light on a handgun on the ground near Adam after shooting him.

The release of the footage and other investigation materials comes at a sensitive time, with the ongoing trial in Minneapolis of former Officer Derek Chauvin in the death of George Floyd and the recent police killing of another Black man, Daunte Wright, in a nearby suburb.

Before the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, an independent board that investigates all shootings by police in Chicago, posted the materials on its website, Mayor Lori Lightfoot called on the public to keep the peace, and some downtown businesses boarded up their windows in anticipation of unrest.

Small groups of protesters gathered at a police station and marched downtown Thursday night, but there were few signs of widespread demonstrations in the city.

“We live in a city that is traumatized by a long history of police violence and misconduct,” Lightfoot said. “So while we don’t have enough information to be the judge and jury of this particular situation, it is certainly understandable why so many of our residents are feeling that all-too-familiar surge of outrage and pain. It is even clearer that trust between our community and law enforcement is far from healed and remains badly broken.”

Nineteen seconds elapsed from when Stillman exited his squad car to when he shot Adam. His body-camera footage shows him chasing the boy on foot down an alley for several seconds and yelling, “Police! Stop! Stop right f— now!”

As Adam slows down, Stillman yells, “Hands! Hands! Show me your f— hands!”

Adam then turns toward the camera, Stillman yells, “Drop it!” and midway between repeating that command, he opens fire and Adam falls down. While approaching the wounded teen, Stillman radios for an ambulance. He can be heard imploring the boy to “stay awake,” and as other officers arrive, Stillman says he can’t feel a heartbeat and begins administering CPR.

In a lengthy email, Stillman’s attorney Tim Grace said Adam left the officer no choice but to shoot.

“The juvenile offender had the gun in his right hand … looked at the officer which could be interpreted as attempting to acquire a target and began to turn to face the officer attempting to swing the gun in his direction,” Grace wrote. “At this point the officer was faced with a life threatening and deadly force situation. All prior attempts to deescalate and gain compliance with all of the officer’s lawful orders had failed.”

Adeena Weiss-Ortiz, an attorney for Adam’s family, told reporters after the footage and other videos were released that they “speak for themselves.”

Weiss-Ortiz said it’s irrelevant whether Adam was holding a gun before he turned toward the officer.

“If he had a gun, he tossed it. The officer said, ‘Show me your hands.’ He complied. He turned around,” she said.

The Chicago Police Department typically doesn’t release the names of officers involved in such shootings this early in an investigation, but Stillman’s name, age and race — he’s 34 and white — were listed in the investigation reports that the Civilian Office of Police Accountability released Thursday.

Weiss-Ortiz said she looked into Stillman’s history and found that “he had no prior discipline, no prior events.”

Lightfoot, who along with the police superintendent called on the independent board to release the video, urged the public to remain peaceful and reserve judgment until the board completes its investigation. Choking up at times, she decried the city’s long history of police violence and misconduct, especially in Black and Latino communities, and said too many young people are left vulnerable to “systemic failures that we simply must fix.”

She also described watching the video as “excruciating.”

“As a mom, this is not something you want children to see,” she said.

In addition to posting Stillman’s video, the review board released footage from other body-worn cameras, four third-party videos, two audio recordings of 911 calls and six audio recordings from ShotSpotter, the system that alerted police to gunshots in that area of Little Village, a predominantly Latino and Black neighborhood on the city’s West Side.

Adam, who was Latino, and a 21-year-old man ran when confronted by police, and Stillman shot the boy once in the chest after a chase during what the department described as an armed confrontation. The 21-year-old man was arrested and booked on a misdemeanor charge of resisting arrest.

The review board initially said it couldn’t release the video because it involved the shooting of a minor, but it changed course after the mayor and police superintendent called for the video’s release.

Lucky Camargo, an activist and lifelong resident of Little Village, decided not to watch the video. But neighbors described it to her as “an execution.”

“This was wrong,” she said. “I didn’t need to watch the video to make that assessment on my own. I don’t feel there was any justification to shoot someone.”

Footage of the shooting had been widely anticipated in the city, where the release of some previous police shooting videos sparked major protests, including the 2015 release of footage of a white officer shooting Black teenager Laquan McDonald 16 times, killing him.

Before the Stillman video’s release, some businesses in downtown Chicago’s Magnificent Mile shopping district boarded up their windows. Lightfoot said that the city had been preparing for months for a verdict in the Chauvin trial and that it had activated a “neighborhood protection plan” ahead of Thursday’s release.

“It happens now that these circumstances are sitting next to each other,” she said.

Adam’s mother described him as a curious and goofy seventh-grader who loved animals, riding his bike and junk food. The Toledo family issued a statement urging people to avoid violent protests.

“We pray that for the sake of our city, people remain peaceful to honor Adam’s memory and work constructively to promote reform,” the family said.

Before the video’s release, Lightfoot and attorneys for the family and city said in a joint statement that they agreed that in addition to the release of the video, all investigation materials should be made public, including a moment-by-moment compilation of what happened that morning.

“We acknowledge that the release of this video is the first step in the process toward the healing of the family, the community and our city,” the joint statement reads. “We understand that the release of this video will be incredibly painful and elicit an emotional response to all who view it, and we ask that people express themselves peacefully.”

The Chicago Police Department has a long history of brutality and racism that has fomented mistrust among the city’s many Black and Latino residents. Adding to that mistrust is the city’s history of suppressing damning police videos.

The city fought for months to keep the public from seeing the video of a white officer shooting Laquan 16 times in 2014, killing him. The officer was eventually convicted of murder. And the city tried to stop a TV news station from broadcasting video of a botched 2019 police raid in which an innocent, unclothed Black woman wasn’t allowed to dress herself until after she was handcuffed.",1323,8138,22,130
0,Opinion | Justin Trudeau is about to set an ambitious new target for greenhouse gas reduction. Canada seems ready for the challenge,https://www.thestar.com/politics/political-opinion/2021/04/14/justin-trudeau-is-about-to-set-an-ambitious-new-target-for-greenhouse-gas-reduction-canada-seems-ready-for-the-challenge.html,"The federal Liberals are poised to commit to cutting greenhouse gas emissions by more than 40 per cent by 2030, the Star has learned — a major ramping up of their climate ambition as the politics around their current target heats up.

That’s easier said than done — especially since Canada has managed to lower emissions by just one per cent over the past 15 years.

But taken together with the Conservatives’ new climate plan and surging investment into clean energy, it’s one more sign that Canada and Canadian voters are ready for fundamental changes to how our economy and our energy consumption work.

A Liberal commitment to surpass 40 per cent is aggressive. It takes the federal ambition beyond Stephen Harper’s 30-per-cent target of old, and it’s in the realm of what’s considered necessary to ensure global warming over the long term is held to just 1.5 C.

And it will set the cat among the political pigeons now that the Conservatives — after months of existential angst — have just laid out a plan for the 30 per cent target.

Under pressure from the White House in advance of U.S. President Joe Biden’s climate summit set for next week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is set to announce the new target some time after Monday’s federal budget or perhaps at the summit itself.

Biden is thinking big — in terms of money the U.S. is willing to spend, in terms of how steeply the U.S. wants to cut emissions, and in terms of what it wants its allies to do alongside it. And Trudeau, it seems, is all ears.

The problem, as both the Liberals and the Conservatives know, is how to actually achieve those emission reductions.

Under both Trudeau and Harper, Canada had promised to cut emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, but neither of their parties had put in place a credible plan that set the country on a path to reach that target until recently.

The Liberals laid out a detailed, fully funded plan to get there in December. It ratcheted up the carbon price for consumers, earmarked $15 billion in low-carbon initiatives, another $15 billion in public transit funding, and set out details to cut emissions by at least 31 per cent by 2030.

As they said at the time, if all the stars align, the plan should be able to deliver a reduction of between 32 and 40 per cent.

Now, the stars are actually aligning. With Biden fully engaged on climate change, Canada has a hope of working with the United States to reduce methane emissions for oil and gas production, and to harmonize fuel efficiency regulations for new cars.

“It certainly makes it a lot easier,” Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson told the Toronto Star’s Alex Ballingall earlier this week. “It just works so much better from an economic perspective, if we can actually have common approaches (to) common targets.”

To surpass a 40 per cent reduction in emissions, however, the federal government will need more than compatibility with the Americans and a carbon tax aimed at consumers.

In Ottawa’s latest analysis of where emissions come from, released just this week, we can see that there are three sectors that make up the lion’s share of our emissions and where emissions are also on the rise: oil and gas, transport and buildings.

So meeting our new target will mean a laserlike focus on what we produce, what we drive, where we live and where we work. That means government spending to support innovation, a massive switch to electric vehicles, and retrofitting of buildings across the country. It also means financing for a hydrogen strategy as well as carbon capture and storage.

And it means collaborating closely with the private sector so that companies can shift their production to clean energy and low-carbon processes. In a position paper published on Thursday, the Business Council of Canada, the lobby group representing Canada’s biggest companies, said it was ready, willing and able to work with government to comply with carbon pricing, reduce emissions and fully embrace sustainable finance.

Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading...

But it also implies lifestyle changes for regular Canadians — some hard choices about our energy consumption, our driving and commuting habits, and our willingness to learn new skills in a changing workforce.

Are we ready for this? Say what you will about the stringency and credibility of the new Conservative plan on climate; the fact that Erin O’Toole has finally now proposed a carbon levy of his own, embraced clean fuel standards and seems to adopt the Liberal price on carbon for large emitters suggests a recognition that voters are indeed ready.

If we can pull this off, the next generation just might thank us.

A former flight attendant, he borrowed from relatives and poured his $5,000 life savings into opening a clothing shop on the outskirts of Delhi selling custom-designed suits, shirts and pants.The shop, called the Right Fit, opened in February 2020, just weeks before the coronavirus struck India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi abruptly enacted one of the world’s toughest nationwide lockdowns to stop it. Unable to pay the rent, Anand closed the Right Fit two months later.Now Anand, his wife and his two children are among millions of people in India in danger of sliding out of the middle class and into poverty. They depend on handouts from his aging in-laws. Khichdi, or watery lentils cooked with rice, has replaced eggs and chicken at the dinner table. Sometimes, he said, the children go to bed hungry.“I have nothing left in my pocket,” said Anand, 38. “How can I not give food to my children?”Now a second wave of COVID-19 has struck India, and the middle class dreams of tens of millions of people face even greater peril. Already, about 32 million people in India were driven into poverty by the pandemic last year, according to the Pew Research Center, accounting for a majority of the 54 million who slipped out of the middle class worldwide.The pandemic is undoing decades of progress for a country that in fits and starts has brought hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. Already, deep structural problems and the sometimes impetuous nature of many of government’s policies had been hindering growth. A shrinking middle class would deal lasting damage.“It’s very bad news in every possible way,” said Jayati Ghosh, a development economist and professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “It has set back our growth trajectory hugely and created much greater inequality.”The second wave presents difficult choices for India. India on Friday reported more than 216,000 new infections, another record. Lockdowns are back in some states. With work scarce, migrant workers are packing into trains and buses home as they did last year. The country’s vaccination campaign has been slow, though the government has picked up the pace.Yet government appears unwilling to repeat last year’s draconian lockdown, which left more than 100 million Indians jobless and which many economists blame for worsening the pandemic’s problems. The government has also been reluctant to increase spending substantially like the United States and some other places, instead releasing a budget that would raise spending on infrastructure and in other areas but that also emphasizes cutting debt.The Modi government has defended its handling of the pandemic, saying vaccinations are making progress and that signs point to an economic resurgence. Economists are forecasting a rebound in the coming year, though the sudden rise in infections and India’s slow vaccination rate — less than 9% of the population has been inoculated — could undermine those predictions.The heady growth forecasts feel far away for Nikita Jagad, who was out of work for over eight months. Jagad, a 49-year-old resident of Mumbai, stopped going out with her friends, eating at restaurants and even taking bus rides, unless the trip was for a job interview. Sometimes, she said, she shut herself inside her bathroom so her 71-year-old mother wouldn’t hear her crying.Last week, Jagad got a new job as a manager at a company that provides housekeeping services for airlines. It pays less than $400 a month, roughly half her previous salary. It could also be short-lived: the state of Maharashtra, home to Mumbai, announced lockdown-like measures this week to stop the spreading second wave.If she loses her new job, Jagad is still the only support for her mother. “If something happens to her,” she said, “I don’t have the money to even admit her in the hospital.”India’s middle class may not be as wealthy as its peers in the United States and elsewhere, but it makes up an increasingly potent economic force. While definitions vary, Pew Research defines middle-class and upper-middle-class households as living on about $10 to $50 a day. The kind of income could give an Indian family an apartment in a nice neighborhood, a car or a scooter, and the opportunities to send their children to a private school.Roughly 66 million people in India meet that definition, compared with about 99 million just before the pandemic last year, according to Pew Research estimates. These increasingly affluent Indian families have drawn foreign companies like Walmart, Amazon, Facebook, Nissan and others to invest heavily in a country of aspirational consumers.Anil G. Kumar, a civil engineer, was one of them. Around this time last year, he and his family were about to buy a two-bedroom apartment. But when last year’s lockdown hit, Kumar’s employer, a construction chemicals manufacturer, slashed his salary by half.“Everything turned turtle within a few hours,” he said. Three months later, his job had been eliminated.Now Kumar spends his days in his home in a working-class neighborhood in the western part of Delhi, searching for jobs on LinkedIn and taking care of his son.The family’s middle-class life is now under threat. They survive on the $470-a-month salary Kumar’s wife draws from a private university. Instead of holding a big celebration for their son’s 10th birthday at a restaurant, which would have cost nearly $70, they ordered a cake and a new outfit for about one-fifth the cost. Kumar also canceled his Amazon Prime subscription, which he hadn’t used in a while.“Every day you can’t sit on the laptop,” he said. “At times, you feel depressed.”India’s middle class is central to more than the economy. It fits into India’s broader ambitions to rival China, which has grown faster and more consistently, as a regional superpower.To get there, the Indian government may need to address the people the coronavirus has left behind. Household incomes and overall consumption have weakened, even though the sales of some goods have increased recently because of pent-up demand. Many of the hardest hit come from India’s merchant class, the shopkeepers, stall operators or other small entrepreneurs who often live off the books of a major company.“India is not even discussing poverty or inequality or lack of employment or fall in incomes and consumption,” said Mahesh Vyas, the chief executive of the Center for Monitoring of the Indian Economy. “This needs to change first and foremost,” he said.Most Indians are “tired” and “discouraged” by the lack of jobs, said Vyas, especially low-skilled workers.“Unless this problem is addressed,” he said, “this will be a millstone that will hold back India’s sustained growth.”Anand, the prospective fashion designer, who lives in the industrial hub of Noida in the southeastern Delhi area, found himself at wits' end during last year’s lockdown. The family fell behind on the rent. Two months into the lockdown, he collapsed in what he described as a panic attack.“We did not want to live,” said his wife, Akanksha Chadda, 33, a former operations manager at a luxury retail store who also hasn’t been able to find a job. She sat facing a photograph taken three years ago of her son and daughter sitting on a giant turtle at an amusement park. “I didn’t know if I would wake up the next morning or not.”The days when they could afford muesli for breakfast and pizza for dinner are gone, Anand said. On good days, they get some vegetables and banana for the kids.In January, Chadda sold their 8-year-old son’s bicycle to buy milk, lentils and vegetables. He cried for a solid evening. But she felt she had little choice. She had already sold her jewelry the month before.“When you don’t see a ray of hope,” she said, “you lose it.”",1280,7816,21,134

Typhoon Surigae is packing 115-120 knots of sustained winds and has become a violent tropical cyclone. It will become a powerful Category 5 typhoon before turning towards the northern Philippines on Sunday and Monday. Surigae is the first typhoon of the 2021 Pacific season.

*** IMPORTANT UPDATE – SEE BELOW ***

UPDATE: A Category 5 Super Typhoon Surigae peaks at 190 mph and 888 mbar, becoming the most intense April tropical cyclone on record, heads further northwest across the Philippine Sea



******

Based on the latest satellite data observation, typhoon Surigae has already reached its maximum sustained winds of 115-120 knots, a 50-knot increase in the last 24 hours. Central pressure is below 940 mbar. Typhoon Surigae is increasingly likely becoming a Category 5 system over the next 24 hours, earning the Super Typhoon status according to the weather model and satellite analysis.

This would then be the first Category 5 system on Earth this year. The last tropical cyclone that struck the Philippines was a real monster, a Category 5 typhoon Goni. Goni was a Super Typhoon with 170 knots winds, becoming one of the most powerful tropical cyclones ever recorded on our planet.

The Eyewall Replacement Cycle (EWRC) with Surigae is almost finished this Saturday morning (local time) which will help the typhoon to gain even more strength and probably continue with its rapid intensification. As soon as the large eye warms and clears, an even faster intensification rate could take place. Typhoon Surigae may reach 130-140 knots when the peak will occur on Sunday.

Surigae also got its secondary designated name Bising after entering the tropical area monitored by the Philippine Meteorological Agency (PAGASA). Typhoon Surigae is also the first tropical cyclone that formed anywhere in the northern hemisphere this year.

Very favorable oceanic and environmental conditions are present ahead of its track this weekend, which will help to boost its intensity even more. The wind shear is also very low, so we are basically seeing near-ideal conditions for a rapid intensification until Surigae strengthens to the maximum, Category 5 strength.

Typhoon Surigae remains an extremely dangerous system for the Philippines late this weekend into early next week as it nears the northern parts of the country. It may blast into the north-northeast Philippines with a massive amount of rainfall and violent winds with life-threatening storm surge.

Prior to Surigae, a strong tropical cyclone Seroja struck Western Australia last week. After a spectacular Fujiwhara effect of two merging tropical cyclones, Seroja and Odette.

In a typical year, about 8 tropical cyclones threaten the land of the Philippines, the highest number of tropical systems that strike any country around the world.

DEEP MJO WAVE EMERGED OVER THE VERY WARM PACIFIC OCEAN

The sea surface temperatures over the western Pacific are very warm lately, even extremely warm/hot further west towards the Indian Sea. Temperatures are reaching about 29 to 30 °C (84-86 °F). Hot seas with temperatures even above 31 °C (87 °F) are seen over the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea.

These are definitely strongly supportive oceanic conditions for the very rapid intensification of any tropical cyclone. This is also the main reason why Surigae has literally exploded into a powerful Category 4 typhoon this Friday and is likely going for the Category 5 strength soon.

The Philippine Sea waters remain quite higher than the long-term average, about 1 °C above normal. Strongly anomalous sea temperature often leads to the explosive development of deep storms, commencing to very well-organized tropical cyclones. Often undergoing rapid intensification.

As we can see from the attached sea temperature anomaly chart below, the majority of the western Pacific is well above average. Also further west across the Indian Sea. Having the highest temperature anomaly around Japan and across the Northwest Pacific.

On both charts above, notice also how cold waters are still present over the Bering Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk, being still partly frozen. Thanks to frigid Arctic conditions still in place that far north through this mid-April.

Another factor that has significantly increased the chances for tropical development over the western Pacific is the so-called MJO wave. The wave coincides well with the above normal sea temperatures over the Pacific. The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is the largest and most dominant source of short-term tropical variability. An eastward-moving wave of thunderstorms circles the entire planet on the equator in about 30 to 60 days.

The MJO consists of two phases, one is the enhanced rainfall (wet phase) and the other is the suppressed rainfall (dry phase). This means that there are increased storms and a lot of rainfall on one side and reduced storms and drier weather on the other side. The wet phase leads to diverging air parcels while the dry phase brings converging air parcels. This horizontal movement of the air is referred to as the Velocity Potential (VP) in the tropics.

We are able to track the entire MJO wave movement by looking at the larger scale air parcels movement. With the weather model data, we can easily see the areas where the air is rising and where it is subsiding.

The graphics below, provided by Michael J. Ventrice, Ph.D. represent an MJO wave with filtered VP200* anomalies (see details below) for the current state, for the week 1 forecast, and for the week 2 forecast.

Cold colors are representative of a more favorable state over the Pacific Ocean for tropical cyclogenesis while warm colors represent a less favorable state for tropical cyclogenesis (e.g. over Africa and South Atlantic).

*VP200 – means a Velocity Potential (VP). It is an indicator of the large-scale divergent flow, so at upper levels in the tropics. The negative VP anomalies (shaded blue in the diagram) are closely tied to the divergent outflow from enhanced convective regions.

Notice how extremely deep the MJO wave is over the western Pacific. Undoubtedly we can see this is a very significant signal of the upward motion, supporting vigorous convection in the region where typhoon Surigae formed.

Another important factor is the Ocean Heat Content (OHC). The OHC takes into account the depth of the sea, and how warm the water layers are deep below the sea surface. Lately, we can see a large pool of high available oceanic heat energy with a very warm water layer running down quite deep over the Philippine Sea. Taking a closer look, one can see how Surigae is moving right into the very favorable conditions this weekend.

Deepwater is also quite warm which typically provides a very favorable environment of a thick layer of warm water. Tropical systems are fueled by these warm layers, as deep convective storms draw energy from hot water. Long story short: the thicker the warm layers are, the more fuel/energy is available to feed the storms.

TYPHOON SURIGAE COULD THREATEN PHILIPPINES

Typhoon Surigae/Bising has tracked west-northwestward at 9 knots overnight to Saturday. Animated enhanced infrared satellite imagery reveals that Bising has rapidly intensified over the past six hours, with the eye of around 5-10 nautical miles clearing.

Based on the advanced Dvorak estimation, the initial intensity is at around 115-120 knots, a solid Category 4 typhoon. The environmental analysis reveals that a very low shear of 10-15 knots is present over the Philippine Sea, with an impressive equatorward and poleward upper-level outflow ventilation. Attached above is a visible satellite during the early morning hours on Saturday.

Typhoon Surigae will continue intensifying this Saturday and will reach a Category 5 strength over the next 12-24 hours. And become a very violent tropical cyclone while gradually moving northwest over the next couple of days. Attached wind gusts swath map below hints how intense winds Surigae could develop – more than 250 km/h while moving towards the north-northeast Philippines.

The exact track of typhoon Surigae is, however, yet unknown, as some global weather models are taking a more westerly shift while some of them suggest a more northerly track.

In the case of Surigae taking the more western track, the system could spread heavy rains with massive flooding and severe damaging winds from the eastern Mindanao to eastern Visaya, and eastern Luzon over the weekend into early next week.

Attached below is the rainfall total map over the next 10 days, based on the ECMWF model. An *extreme* amount of rainfall could happen over the northern Luzon island and could lead to destructive flooding. It indeed strongly depends on how west shift the tropical cyclone will take over the next 24 hours. We can see 500-800 mm of rain will be possible.

Coastal flooding is likely to be expected, especially in bays and inlets, depending on where the Surigae’s center will pass. Destructive wave will blast the coast with major storm surge, potentially leading to land erosion.

After typhoon Surigae moves away from the Philippines, it will rapidly lose its strength coming into much less favorable oceanic conditions for tropical cyclones. However, conditions need to be very closely monitored of Surigae would threaten Japan island Iwo To. Stay tuned for further updates!

But he has not quelled the threat that Mr Navalny poses to his rule. An open letter sent to The Economist today from nearly 80 eminent writers, actors, artists, historians and public intellectuals from around the world highlights the ignominy Mr Putin is bringing upon himself and his regime.

The signatories report that Mr Navalny, who last August survived poisoning with Novichok, a nerve agent, that many blame on Mr Putin, has symptoms of a severe neurological disorder—constant back pain and the loss of sensation in his legs and hands, as well as a severe cough and fever. “As a Russian citizen, he has the lawful right to be examined and treated by a doctor of his choice,” note the signatories of the letter. “Having been denied this right, on March 30th, he began a hunger strike in protest.” His wife says that, in his cell in Pokrov, some 100km (60 miles) east of Moscow, he has lost some 16kg in weight.

He is now being threatened with forcefeeding that would amount to torture. Mr Navalny’s doctors have demanded immediate access to him, saying his health is now approaching a critical state.

Instead of a doctor, the Kremlin has sent a television propaganda team, led by Maria Butina, a celebrity Putin supporter who was jailed in America for infiltrating American political circles as part of Russia’s attempt to influence the presidential election of 2016. Swaggering into Mr Navalny’s barrack with a TV crew, she yelled that the prison was more comfortable than a hotel in the small Siberian town where she grew up. (No matter that it has no hotel at all.) When Mr Navalny’s doctor and political ally, Anastasia Vasilyeva, arrived at the prison gates to demand access a few days later, she was detained, along with several journalists, including one from CNN.

Few things illustrate the pettiness of Mr Putin’s regime as clearly as its treatment of political prisoners. Mr Navalny asked for a family photo album; it was denied. While he is on hunger strike, he says, the prison governor had sweets planted in his clothes and gave his cellmates an electric stove on which they grill chicken and bread. “This is the essence of this regime’s [belief]: why would anyone want to defend his principles or fight for his rights if there is tasty grilled chicken nearby,” Mr Navalny said in an Instagram post via his lawyers.

While the Kremlin tries to crush Mr Navalny’s morale, his team has mounted a campaign to free him. It has called for a 500,000 strong street protest demanding Mr Navalny’s release and has already persuaded nearly 450,000 to sign up for it. And it continues to needle Mr Putin with revelations of alleged corruption in his regime, including, most recently a new revelation about one of Mr Putin’s lavish residences with massage rooms, a swimming pool, and an extreme-cold cryotherapy chamber.

Faced with the possibility of the largest protest in modern Russia’s history and the prospect of suffering a crushing defeat in the parliamentary elections in September, the Kremlin has responded with drastic threats. On April 16th Russian prosecutors demanded that Mr Navalny’s anti-corruption foundation and all his regional branches should be banned as extremist organisations. This would mean that anyone working or even volunteering for Mr Navalny could face criminal charges.

A statement, issued by Mr Navalny’s team, says this amounts to mass political repression. “The darkest times for any freethinking people and for the civil society in Russia are coming. Effectively the Kremlin has just demanded that anyone who disagrees with it, who disagrees with [Mr Putin’s] palaces...with corruption...is recognised as an extremist.” The Kremlin’s move has solidified Mr Navalny’s reputation as Mr Putin’s number-one opponent.

Even in his torment, Mr Navalny can subject Mr Putin, too, to an agonising dilemma. On the one hand, giving in to the hunger striker’s demand would look like a political defeat, and a moral victory for his hated critic. But to let him die would make Mr Putin even more like “the killer” President Joe Biden has called him. Facing new American sanctions imposed this week for a range of Russian behaviour, Mr Putin must know that Mr Navalny’s death would make any hope of international rehabilitation even more remote.",740,4458,24,139

Within the top 20 most dangerous nations across the globe, Saudi Arabia ranked second among Middle East and North African nations, followed by Oman (5), Qatar (8), UAE (9), Yemen (10), Sudan (13), West Bank and Gaza (14), Iran (15), Morocco (18), Egypt (19), and Algeria (20).

“As of now, 28 countries have marriage equality, and 16 countries provide civil unions or partnerships,"" Asher and Lyric wrote. ""Two countries – Bulgaria and Israel – do not allow marriage equality for their citizens but formally recognize marriages overseas.”

Israel does not criminalize same-sex relations in contrast to nearly all countries in the Middle East and North Africa regions.

Qatar’s Islamic regime, which imposes the death penalty on gays, is slated to host the FIFA World Cup football competition in 2022. Saudi Arabia and the Islamic Republic of Iran also execute gays and lesbians.

According to a 2008 British WikiLeaks cable, Iran executed between 4,000-6,000 gays and lesbians since its 1979 Islamic revolution. The Jerusalem Post reported in 2019 that Iran’s regime publicly hanged a man based on a violation of its anti-gay law.

The Post’s disclosure of the 2019 execution in Iran played a role in the US government’s launching of a campaign to decriminalize homosexuality across the world. Richard Grenell, the former US director for national intelligence and ambassador to Germany at the time, jumpstarted the international campaign to stop state-sponsored executions of gays.

Lyric and Asher explained the study’s methodology: “We looked at the top 150 most-visited countries in the world (by the number of incoming tourists) and then carefully examined LGBTQ+ rights for each country. We created our LGBTQ+ travel safety index based on a total of nine ranking factors. In this year’s update, we also added transgender legal identity laws which weren’t included in our original 2019 study.”

The nine factors are: Legalizes same-sex marriage, worker protections, protection against discrimination, criminalization of violence, adoption recognition, whether it is a good place to live, transgender legal identity laws, illegal same-sex relations and propaganda/morality laws.",466,3010,21,140

It seemingly marked the end of a very dark period in Greece’s recent history, but Golden Dawn’s second-in-command Christos Pappas, sentenced to at least 13 years in jail for running a criminal organisation, disappeared after failing to turn up at court. Officially, no one knows where Pappas currently is. Unofficially though, it’s a very different, and wild, story involving radical monks, cops with far-right sympathies, and a convicted war criminal.

ATHENS – The birthplace of democracy has a major Nazi problem. For six months now, cops and intelligence officials have searched fruitlessly for a leading figure of a far-right criminal gang that was for a time Greece’s third biggest political party.

Two weeks later, the same three-judge panel dropped sentence after sentence on 57 members of the group’s leadership, most receiving about 13 years. It should have been a great victory against fascism, except Pappas, the group’s second-in-command, and Ioannis Lagos, Golden Dawn’s only elected member of the European Parliament, didn’t show up to be jailed. Lagos still sits in a Brussels apartment having invoked diplomatic immunity as an MEP, arguing that his conviction was a political witch hunt. His immunity will almost certainly be voided as the pandemic-slowed wheels of bureaucracy eventually catch up with him, but in the meanwhile he still collects his €9,000 monthly salary (about £7,750), and is furious to have been stripped of his daily €323 allowance (about £280).

On a beautiful autumn day last October, tens of thousands of Greeks gathered around the heavily guarded central courthouse in Athens to hear three judges convict the top leadership of the ultra-nationalist party that had terrorised leftists and immigrants across the country for over a decade, for a menu of crimes ranging from operating a criminal gang, to murder. With the convictions, the judges finally ended Golden Dawn’s leap from a violent racist rabble to a violent racist rabble-like political party that received millions of euros in annual taxpayer-funded support from Greece and the European Union.

When compared to its formation on the bloody ethnic battlefields of the post-Communism Balkans and its heyday as a political party that murdered its enemies in public, Golden Dawn’s demise was relatively wholesome.

But the cops have nothing on Pappas, a former member of the Greek parliament and fan of Nazi cosplay . Half a year later, no one knows where he is.

They didn’t just work out together. The cops loved to vote for Golden Dawn as they rose to become the third biggest party in Greece in 2012, with police voters giving Golden Dawn heavy support in some areas, according to a 2012 analysis by Al Jazeera. But after the one-time street gang achieved a huge electoral breakthrough to win about 7 percent of the votes, which got them into the Greek and European Parliaments, the situation changed massively, said Parras.

Every weekend there were attacks on immigrants, hundreds of them never reported from what we can determine because of fear of having wrong papers.

“In the 1990s and early 2000s, the police and security forces wanted Golden Dawn to do their dirty jobs for them in suppressing Leftist demonstrations, the anarchists and their demonstrations,” Parras said of the era that saw widespread violence between the ultra-left and right. “There was coordination between MAT [the notoriously rugged special riot police] and Golden Dawn — MAT is often recruited from the ranks of the [Army] Special Forces and it’s been well established they coordinated during this era. And there’s the natural affinity of young men in special forces going to gyms, similar ideas of the body and martial fitness. A lot of them worked out together.”

That Golden Dawn and Greek police and security units have close fraternal and, even at times, operational relationships, became impossible to deny after a series of arrests in 2013, according to journalist Dimitris Parras, whose unrelenting coverage of the group’s early days was basically ignored in Greece. So it’s hard for many Greeks to take the police claims that they’d properly monitored Pappas’ years-long house arrest seriously.

For civil society, immigrants, and Greece’s committed leftist community that had all been targeted by Golden Dawn’s violence, Pappas’ disappearance is a rude twist to what could have been a reasonably happy ending, and fast becoming a stain on Greece’s international reputation. There’s a sinking feeling that Pappas escaped justice with the help of the Greek security services, the Orthodox Church, and a convicted Serbian war criminal.

“They had a big plan to climb the staircase into the EU and get its money as a political party,” he said, but prior to that Golden Dawn had spent years attacking immigrants – in both an organised and random way.

Prior to its electoral breakthrough in the 2012 Greek elections, when it began winning about 7 percent support in successive elections through to 2015, Golden Dawn mainly focused on beating up immigrants and left-wing political figures, according to lawyer Kostas Skarmeas. He represented three Egyptian fishermen nearly beaten to death in their Athens apartment by a local Golden Dawn unit, in a trial which revealed the attack to be a planned operation led by local party members.

Six months after Pappas disappeared, the official line is he’s in Greece and will be found. But several people, from Greek security officials to regional intelligence officers who have worked war crimes cases in the Balkans, told VICE World News of their suspicions of more official involvement in his disappearance.

And it's that sense of collaboration between the centre-right and far-right in Greece that has Golden Dawn’s victims wondering if these ties – between the parties, the powerful and conservative Orthodox church that often considers itself the arbiter of what is truly Greek, and the security forces – will allow Pappas to never serve his prison term.

He’s not exaggerating, according to witness accounts and residents of the central Athens neighbourhood of Victoria, a centre of refugee and immigrant life in Greece.

“Every weekend there were attacks on immigrants, hundreds of them never reported from what we can determine because of fear of having wrong papers, being a refugee or because the perception that the police were aligned with Golden Dawn,” said Skarmeas.

Asked how many people he personally knew who were attacked in such a manner, Ali suggested at least six personally and says he’s known of dozens more. It was common in a community with few Greek friends.

We were protecting immigrants from the Nazis that the cops had sent after us.

“Terrible time, terrible people,” said ‘Ali,’ a shopkeeping immigrant originally from Bangladesh, who arrived in 1995, speaking on the condition of anonymity. “People would run home after dark from the shops because there would be men chasing you for being an immigrant.”

“They would hunt in packs like wolves looking for someone alone to attack, it was every weekend for years,” they said, asking not to be named because they’re no longer involved in anarchist causes.

“There were at least 40 attacks on immigrants that led to serious medical care or hospitalisations over that period [roughly 2010 to 2012] in Victoria,” said the activist in neighbouring Exachia, home to a number of hard-left anarchist collectives who still periodically clash with police riot squads.

Ali’s account sounds about right to a one-time leader of an anarchist group in a nearby neighbourhood that tried to provide security for immigrants by brutally brawling with Golden Dawn members.

Outside of some dedicated reporters like Parras, Greeks didn’t want to see the armed gangs literally beating people with impunity on their streets and Greek mainstream right politicians – who share a lot of common ground with the hard right on the issue of immigration – were eager to share political spoils with allies willing to aggressively attack their political enemies. And we are talking about literal attacks.

But after 2012, the racist gang of Golden Dawn had gone legit in the eyes of Europe’s political establishment. And Greece’s mainstream right parties were clearly looking to work with them. Eagerly, in fact, despite the ongoing campaign of attacks that never became a political issue because the victims were often illegal immigrants or radical leftists. The establishment, starting with the police up through the ministries and even to the media, found them easy to ignore and dismiss.

“Today the [anarchist] movement is dead, the government and various internal and external political conditions have ended most of the militant leftists and anarchist groups,” they said. “But in that era these were real fights, not the political performances you often see with ‘Antifa’ today. These were leftists going out together to battle racist Nazis in what felt like a true ideological fight for Greece. People died on both sides but it was always clear what side the cops were on. We were protecting immigrants from the Nazis that the cops had sent after us.”

About 50 guys made it in time to receive the baseball bats, clubs and knives being distributed by officials from what was, at the time, Greece’s third largest political party. The cause for action? Leftist rapper and union activist Pavlos Fyssas was sitting in a nearby cafe with a handful of friends watching Olympiakos play Paris Saint-Germain.

At about 11pm on Sunday, September the 17th, 2013, the members of Golden Dawn’s Nikea branch received a text message from one of their top leaders, Giorgos Roupakias, that everyone had ten minutes to get to the local Golden Dawn office.

“All that changes after the murder but the personal ties and relations are still very strong,” he said.

“Golden Dawn supported the regime and its laws, often voting for them,” said Parras of the right-wing government in power at the time. “At this stage we saw an open collaboration between politics and the security services and Golden Dawn was part of this.”

But there’s no version of tough that can handle 50 Nazi skinheads carrying bats and knives jumping you and a handful of friends with the intent to kill. And the testimony in court, which lays out the run up and organisation of the murder in sickening detail, makes it absolutely clear that Roupakias came for murder as he and five other men with knives specifically hunted down Fyssas among his wildly outnumbered friends, who’d gone from drinking beer and watching football to fighting for their lives. Of course they killed him, there was never any intention for this to be a fair fight – it was an assassination.

A well-known figure in both the Greek leftist and hip hop scene, Fyssas was a committed enemy of Golden Dawn and the hard right – not to mention a pretty tough guy: A member of the Syndicate of Metalworkers of Piraeus, just like his father.

“There was millions of euros in the hands of a criminal gang,” said Skarmeas of the period between the 2012 elections and the murder of Fyssas, whose slaying he said represented Golden Dawn’s shift away from targeting immigrants to “focus[ing] on attacking the Greek Antifa-Communist movements.”

Warrants were issued, and raids on offices and members’ homes found the hard drives and mobile phones that proved the longstanding but not publicly admitted ties between Golden Dawn and the mainstream parties.

Starting to understand why we figure Pappas won’t get caught? At home these guys are protected by the government but they can travel because they have lots of friends in the Balkans.

If nobody cared about scores of brutally beaten immigrants, the notion that a political party had openly organised the murder of a political opponent via text message – and then committed that murder in public with scores of attackers – finally defined Golden Dawn in terms that even the most craven political opportunists on the mainstream right couldn’t ignore any longer.

“Starting to understand why we figure Pappas won’t get caught?” an Athens resident told VICE World News. “At home these guys are protected by the government but they can travel because they have lots of friends in the Balkans.”

“After the arrests, inspections of the laptops and mobile phones showed close communication with [politicians who today back the ruling New Democracy Party] speaking as friends, trading votes,” he said.

The “filthy” monastery, it turns out, really is filthy because it’s a neo-Nazi squat, according to a church official, who told the local press that he believed Pappas had sheltered at the Esphigmenou Monastery on Mt Athos, famous for being in the hands of renegade conservative monks since the 1970s.

“If they haven’t arrested him in some filthy monastery in Greece within a few weeks, he’s probably with ultra-right Serbs who got him out,” he added. “He’s got ties to Šešelj and the Serbs going back to the Balkan wars, check out the Greeks at Srebrenica.”

“The Golden Dawn guy? We think that crazy fucking Serb cult got him out,” he said via encrypted messenger, explaining he’d worked undercover in Greece on a related operation about a decade ago. “Yeah [Golden Dawn] has close ties to the security services but in a case like this he can’t hide forever because most of the cops in Greece are actually looking for him.”

A central European intelligence official who works in counter-intelligence in the Balkans was forthright when asked about the Pappas situation in January.

The legal battles and church schisms involved are literally too Byzantine to explain in detail, but Mt Athos, an isolated, rocky peninsula in northern Greece, is legendary or infamous depending on your religious point of view. Filled with more than a dozen monasteries and cut off from the mainland, it’s basically been controlled by monks in near-complete religious rebellion against mainstream church authorities since 2002. The community is so extreme that it can’t reconcile with the already hardline Greek Orthodox Church, which itself refused to stop offering communion from the same silver spoon to elderly people during the pandemic. The stated reason was Satan poses a bigger threat than COVID.

Vartholomaios, who like the Greek police, intelligence services, justice ministry and prime minister’s office, refused to speak on the record for this story, is the legally assigned abbot to the monastery and the cult of radical monks has been occupying his belfry since the 1970s. He cheered the October verdicts against Golden Dawn because he claimed the group had been using the place as a hideout and training camp, with even rumours of people being held prisoner.

We will of course look for him with any lead here in Greece. But I think that’s only if he comes back. He’s being hidden by his Serb friends.

“When I heard that Pappas had disappeared, my first thought was they have him in the monastery. I don’t know if they have investigated, but the police would have a hard time trying to search the monastery, which they have turned into a fortress,” Abbot Vartholomaios of Esphigmenou Chapter of Mt Athos told the Greek newspaper Kathimerini.

“We will of course look for him with any lead here in Greece,” said the official. “But I think that’s only if he comes back. He’s being hidden by his Serb friends.”

“If he wasn’t there himself, it was being used by the people helping him hide and we have information Athos was part of the journey out of the country into Serbia or Kosovo,” said the Greek police official, who pointed to an international arrest warrant issued by Greece in February.

Police did actually raid the monastery in February but missed Pappas. A Greek police official, speaking on background, believed Pappas had used the area as a hideout after he first went missing following his last October check-in with police before he was due to be jailed.

“Šešelj is part of that old [network] used after the wars in the 1990s to keep people out of war crimes trials,” said the central European intelligence officer, who worked in Serbia and Kosovo on war crimes cases. “His ten years in prison in The Hague, his role in the pre and post war political movement of ultra-Serbian nationalism makes him very well respected in these circles. Is he the most powerful man in Serbia? Far from it, but he’s got the ability to hide an old Nazi from Interpol. At least for awhile.”

“It is worth noting that the Golden Dawn had close relations with Šešelj, for example he visited Thessaloniki in 2017 and he gave a press conference together with Golden Dawn,” one activist said, providing a link to the event.

And what Serb friends Pappas appears to have. Vojislav Šešelj, a hardline Bosnian-Serb politician convicted of war crimes and living openly in Serbia, was named by three officials, including the central European intelligence officer, as a close friend of Pappas with even closer ties to the radical elements of the Orthodox Church very much suspected of direct involvement by almost everyone VICE World News spoke to for this story.

“By the time of the sentencing two weeks later we have intelligence that indicates he’d passed through [North] Macedonia into either Serbia or Kosovo, with repeated mentions he was dressed as a monk,” said the Greek police official.

All three officials agree that, using monasteries in Mt Athos as a support hub, Pappas had moved to the area around the beginning of October.

The Serbian political entities in Republika Srpska and Kosovo are considered much more nationalistic and work harder to protect fugitives than Serbia proper, according to multiple war crimes investigators who worked in the region.

“That's the official line and it's the truth,” said the Serb diplomat. “The unofficial line is we know that these radical friends of his helped him escape Greece and while he probably passed through Serbia, I don’t see much evidence he stayed, the most logical and safest thing for him would have been to move to remote areas of [Serbian-held] Kosovo or [the Bosnian Republika Srpska] to hide with the crazy monks. If we find him in Serbia we will arrest him but in those places I don’t know who can do it.”

Serbs really don’t like to give up Serbs. And Pappas might be popular with radicals but he’s not Serb.

The Serbs deny everything officially, but a foreign ministry official told VICE World News that police were actively searching for Pappas based on tips and would certainly arrest him if he was found.

The Central European official agrees that Serbia wouldn’t kill itself looking for Pappas, but with enough pressure it would be perfectly willing to arrest him.

“This is consistent with Pappas having grown a beard while on trial and awaiting sentencing, we used to joke he was doing it for the church,” said Parras, the reporter who followed Golden Dawn for years.

“Serbs really don’t like to give up Serbs,” he said. “And Pappas might be popular with radicals but he’s not Serb and I can’t see the Serbian government willing to take pressure over him. But if he’s in [Republika Srpska] or Kosovo? Those are much more radical local governments with far less influence over the monks, and we learned [from] hunting down Serb war criminals in the 1990s that [non-monk] Serbs might turn on a Serb but the monks will never cooperate with the police.”

And Golden Dawn certainly has war-crime credibility with those elements of ultra-Serbian nationalism going back to the early 1990s, via dozens of Greek volunteers who went to Serbia and Bosnia to fight as the former Yugoslavia violently fell apart.

In its earliest days, Golden Dawn actually hated ethnic Slavs and even pushed for eliminating Christianity all together from Greece in a return to its neo-pagan roots. But this stance proved to be too metal even for the Greek hard right, and the fighting in nearby Bosnia – defined by many in Serbia and Greece as a battle against Turks not Bosnians – unified the movement under a version of Orthodox nationalism and ethnic paranoia. And while at the time Golden Dawn was just one of a number of tiny groups in the right wing scene, dozens of members of the Greek hard right fought alongside the Serbs in their own Greek volunteer unit. And about a dozen Greek fighters were present at the fall, and subsequent massacre at Srebrenica in 1995.

The Athens neighbourhoods of Victoria and Exachia are no longer the scene of pitched battles between Communists and Nazis, as the restive anarchist squats have been badly weakened by arrests and police pressure, and the Nazis remain quiet or locked up after the trials. But the surrounding streets and parks are heavily patrolled by riot police and motorcycle jump-out teams that conduct heavy-handed lockdown checks and often demand papers from carefully masked refugees. In many cases the fear of Golden Dawn has been replaced by fear of the police.

But still the change is noticeable, even during a stroll in a local park. Hundreds of Greeks and refugees – mostly South Asian and Afghan – mingled together, playing cricket and football, enjoying the sun.",3562,21476,20,140

Serum Institute of India (SII) CEO Adar Poonawalla on April 16 requested United States President Joe Biden to lift the embargo on export of raw materials to help other countries ramp up COVID-19 vaccine production.



Respected @POTUS, if we are to truly unite in beating this virus, on behalf of the vaccine industry outside the U.S., I humbly request you to lift the embargo of raw material exports out of the U.S. so that vaccine production can ramp up. Your administration has the details.

Poonawalla tweeted: “Respected @POTUS, if we are to truly unite in beating this virus, on behalf of the vaccine industry outside the U.S., I humbly request you to lift the embargo of raw material exports out of the U.S. so that vaccine production can ramp up. Your administration has the details.”

His tweet comes following Oxford-AstraZeneca’s legal notice to the Serum Institute, which manufactures Covishield – one of the coronavirus vaccines being administered in India.

Poonawalla had said earlier that SII would need around Rs 3,000 crore to ramp up COVID-19 vaccine production capacity.

The vaccine maker hopes to increase its capacity of Covishield production to 110 million doses per month June onwards.

SII has already delivered over 100 million doses to India and exported around 60 million doses to other countries.

Things are already getting complicated.",https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/04/demise-arecibo-and-rise-chinas-fast-telescope/618608/,"Until, that is, FAST opened to astronomers, for the first time since its construction finished in 2016. After that initial completion, scientists and engineers spent years commissioning it and bringing it up to full scientific operation. They deemed it ready for proposals from would-be users in China early last year. “The timeline was very tight, and it was extremely difficult to get everything ready for opening to the world [at] that time,” Keping Qiu, a professor in the School of Astronomy and Space Science at Nanjing University, wrote in an email to Undark. Qiu leads the committee that will evaluate the incoming ideas and added, “The FAST group worked very hard over the past year, and now the telescope is making the step forward” by opening up to the world.

Read: What happens if China makes first contact?

If the international researchers’ ideas pass muster, those scientists will get approximately 10 percent of the telescope’s time, and the remaining 90 percent will go to Chinese scientists. “We expect that FAST would not only take the place of Arecibo in supporting astronomers doing good science in relevant research areas,” Qiu said, “but also make breakthroughs and open new windows for research in radio astronomy.”

This kind of shared use mirrors the way many large observatories around the world work, in which an Open Skies policy lets anyone from anywhere compete for observing time. It also reflects China’s broader efforts to host world-class facilities that foreign researchers envy—a flex of global muscle. But scientific tensions and suspicions currently run high between the U.S. and China: American researchers have faced increasing censure for taking undisclosed money from China, the U.S. fears its rival would like to steal intellectual property, and concrete restrictions exist for certain space scientists who’d like to work across these particular borders. Current federal law in the U.S., for instance, severely limits NASA and its scientists from working on projects with China and its scientists. Collaboration, it turns out, rarely comes without complication.

But American and Chinese astronomers both hope this particular opportunity will nevertheless work smoothly for both sides. “Observatories generally feel that they benefit by having an influx. The more people from more places that come through and use the telescope,” Cordes says, “it kind of lifts all boats, that rising tide.”

Cordes and colleagues are hoping to use FAST at some point for work on a project called NANOGrav (short for North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves). The group watches to see if pulsars’ pulses, which are emitted like clockwork, arrive delayed or early. In aggregate, that messy timetable indicates that ripples in the fabric of the universe, called gravitational waves, are stretching or squishing said fabric. But to get the job done, astronomers must spy every couple of weeks on a network of pulsars, for which they had previously used both Arecibo and America’s next-largest instrument, the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope, in West Virginia. When Arecibo collapsed, the team was left looking for a new instrument.",503,3180,22,148

Over 18,000 Pentagon contractors remain in Afghanistan, while official troops number 2,500. Joe Biden will withdraw this smaller group of soldiers while leaving behind US Special Forces, mercenaries, and intelligence operatives — privatizing and downscaling the war, but not ending it.

(This article was originally published at CovertAction Magazine.)

On April 14, President Joe Biden announced that he would end the U.S.’s longest war and withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan on the 20th anniversary of the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks.

Over 6,000 NATO troops will also be withdrawn by that time.

“War in Afghanistan was never meant to be a multigenerational undertaking,” Biden said during his remarks from the White House Treaty Room, the same location from which President George W. Bush had announced the war was beginning in October 2001. “We were attacked. We went to war with clear goals. We achieved those objectives. Bin Laden is dead and al Qaeda is degraded in Afghanistan and it’s time to end the forever war.”

Biden’s claim that he is ending the forever war is misleading. As The New York Times reported, the United States would remain after the formal departure of U.S. troops with a “shadowy combination of clandestine Special Operations Forces, Pentagon contractors and covert intelligence operatives.” Their mission will be to “find and attack the most dangerous Qaeda or Islamic state threats, current and former American officials said.”

The Times further reported that the United States maintains a constellation of air bases in the Persian Gulf region as well as in Jordan, and a major air headquarters in Qatar, which could provide a launching pad for long-range bomber or armed drone missions into Afghanistan.

Matthew Hoh, a disabled combat veteran who resigned from the State Department in 2009 in protest of the war, stated that a genuine peace process in Afghanistan is “dependent upon foreign forces leaving Afghanistan.”

Further, Hoh said that, “Regardless of whether the 3500 acknowledged U.S. troops leave Afghanistan, the U.S. military will still be present in the form of thousands of special operations and CIA personnel in and around Afghanistan, through dozens of squadrons of manned attack aircraft and drones stationed on land bases and on aircraft carriers in the region, and by hundreds of cruise missiles on ships and submarines.”

Mercenaries R Us

The meaninglessness of President Biden’s announcement becomes apparent when we consider that the Pentagon employs more than seven contractors for every serviceman or woman in Afghanistan, an increase from one contractor for every serviceman or woman a decade ago.

As of January, more than 18,000 contractors remained in Afghanistan, according to a Defense Department report, when official troop totals had been reduced to 2,500.

These totals reflect the U.S. government’s strategy of outsourcing war to the benefit of private mercenary corporations, and as a means of distancing the war from the public and averting dissent, since relatively few Americans are directly impacted by it.

Most of the mercenaries are ex-military veterans, though a percentage are third-country nationals who are paid meager wages to perform menial duties for the military.

One of the biggest mercenary companies is DynCorp International of Falls Church Virginia, which as of 2019 had received over $7 billion in government contracts to train the Afghan army and manage military bases in Afghanistan.

From 2002 to 2013, DynCorp received 69 percent of all State Department funding. Forbes Magazine called it “one of the big winners of the Iraq and Afghan Wars” — the losers being almost everyone else.

A blueprint for U.S. strategy in Afghanistan is the 1959-1975 secret war in Laos, where the CIA worked with hundreds of civilian contractors who flew spotter aircraft, ran ground bases, and operated radar stations in civilian clothes while raising its own private army among the Hmong to fight the pro-communist Pathet Lao.

The CIA and Special Forces have again attempted to recruit tribal elements in Afghanistan and, like in Laos, have become enmeshed in inter-tribal and sectarian feuds.

For years, U.S. Special Forces operatives have also been training Afghan security forces as a proxy army and running Phoenix-style snatch and grab and assassination missions, which are poised to continue — despite the formal troop withdrawal.

What Uncle Sam really wants in Afghanistan

Republican hawk Jim Inhofe lambasted Biden’s withdrawal plan, stating that this was a “reckless and dangerous decision. Arbitrary deadlines would likely put our troops in danger, jeopardize all the progress we’ve made, and lead to civil war in Afghanistan — and create a breeding ground for international terrorists.”

Inhofe it should be noted is a war profiteer. He invested in the stocks of leading arms manufacturer Raytheon at the same time he was calling for an increase in the defense budget as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

Inhofe’s assessment is flawed because, among other reasons, the U.S. has not made much progress in 19 years of war (the Taliban, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, is stronger than at any point since 2001 and controls about one-fifth of Afghanistan), and Afghanistan was never really a breeding ground for international terrorists.

The 9/11 hijackers mostly came from Saudi Arabia, and the Taliban agreed to turn over Osama Bin Laden to an international court after the 9/11 attacks, which they never supported.

The Afghan War will go on indefinitely not because of the threat of terrorism — which is accentuated by the U.S. military presence — but because the United States will not concede ground in the region.

The U.S. has announced intentions to retain at least two military bases in Afghanistan after the official troop drawdown, and set up over 1000 bases during the war.

Uncle Sam also covets Afghans’ mineral wealth. A 2007 United States Geological Service survey discovered nearly $1 trillion in mineral deposits, including huge veins of iron, copper, cobalt, gold, and critical industrial metals like lithium, which is used in the manufacture of batteries for laptops and cellphones.

An internal Pentagon memo stated that Afghanistan could become the “Saudi Arabia of lithium.”

In 2001, when the U.S. first invaded Afghanistan, it was in the process of expanding its military infrastructure in Central Asia. Afghanistan provided a key way-station to this new “oil dorado,” which holds as much as 200 billion barrels of oil — about 10 times the amount found in the North Sea, and a third of the Persian Gulf’s total reserves.

Afghanistan was further valued at the time as a key location for an oil pipeline that would transport Central Asian oil to the Indian Ocean while bypassing Russia.

In the 1990s, the Southern California oil company Unocal began taking steps to build the pipeline, even courting the Taliban. In 2018, ground was broken on a new pipeline project backed by the United States that will carry oil from Turkmenistan to northern India.

The U.S. ruling establishment’s greatest fear is that a complete U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan might result in the U.S. losing a strategic foothold to its main geopolitical rivals, China and Russia.

China has recently increased its trade and investment in Afghanistan — with which it shares a border — and has sought to cultivate better relations with the Afghan government and Taliban.

Russia, meanwhile, reopened a cultural center in Kabul in 2014, rebuilt an abandoned Soviet friendship center, expanded its embassy staff, boosted economic investment, and provided 10,000 Kalashnikov rifles to the Afghan government.

Moscow also supported Afghan housing projects and took advantage of contacts in Kabul to renew ties with ethnic power brokers in the North while quietly courting the Taliban.

As a previous CovertAction Magazine article documented, the current Afghan government led by Ashraf Ghani is largely a creation of the United States. Its military is funded by the United States at a cost of around $4 billion per year. This support is going to continue — unless Congress cuts it off — alongside large-scale U.S. foreign aid programs that amount to nearly $1 billion per year.

The U.S. wants to keep Ghani in power, or replace him with another proxy that can help it win the geopolitical competition with Russia and China, which is little different from the 19th-century “great game” between Great Britain and Czarist Russia.

The prime minister’s chancellery shared the data on social media: “Changes in the level of employment in general in EU states – data for the fourth quarter of 2020.”

In addition to Poland, Luxembourg also saw a 0.6-percentage-point growth in employment. The remaining member states, with the exception of the Netherlands, which maintained a stable employment rate, noted drops in employment growth mainly due to the pandemic crisis. The highest decreases were seen in Ireland and Spain with a loss of -2.5 percentage points.

Poland has recorded the highest growth in employment in the European Union in the last quarter of 2020 on a year-to-year basis, according to Eurostat data. In comparison with data for the last quarter of 2019, the index of employed persons in Poland increased by 0.8 percentage points.

It is important to note, however, that this data does not mean that the index of employed is the highest among EU states overall. This means, that Poland has seen the highest growth in the period which the data concerns, so 2020.

The index of employed people of working age in Poland is 69.2 percent, according to data for the fourth quarter of 2020. While this result is above the EU average (67.9 percent), there are countries in which this index is significantly higher: Holland (77.8 percent), Germany (76.3 percent) and Sweden (75.3 percent).

Eurostat pointed out, that the entire job market in the EU slightly improved in the last quarter of 2020 compared to the third quarter of the same year. The employment index among people aged 20-64 was 72.6 percent in the fourth quarter, which was a 0.3 percentage point increase compared to third quarter.

The number of working people in the EU dropped by 3.13 million in the entire EU in 2020. The decrease amounted to 2.67 million in the Eurozone itself.

Eurostat data also shows what has been known for quite a while – the pandemic has hit youth on the job market particularly harshly. Nevertheless, the scale of this issue may be shocking when compared to other countries.

In the period between the end of 2019 and the end of 2020, employment of people aged between 15-24 decreased by 208 thousand. This is the worst result in the EU. It is better even in much larger countries such as Germany or those struggling with issues on the job market, such as Spain. In these states, the decreases were much lower and were accordingly: 175 thousand for Germany and 198 thousand for Spain.",447,2659,27,149
0,Spain’s Endesa power firm sued over electrocution of birds. Landmark case says thousands of birds including endangered eagles die needlessly each year,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/16/spains-power-company-endesa-sued-over-electrocution-of-birds,"In Leonard Cohen’s famous song, a bird on a wire is a symbol of freedom, but for thousands of birds it is the equivalent of being sent to the electric chair.

Now, in a landmark case, a Spanish electricity company is being prosecuted over the deaths of hundreds of birds electrocuted on pylons and overhead cables and for failing to comply with regulations designed to protect wildlife.

After a three-year investigation, Antoni Pelegrín, the attorney general for the environment in Barcelona, has brought a case for ecological crimes against the electricity company Endesa and six of its senior executives for allegedly failing to meet safety requirements.

The lawsuit claims that between 2018 and 2020 255 birds were electrocuted on pylons near Osona in northern Catalonia. Most were storks, eagles, peregrine falcons and vultures.

Separately, over three days in August 2018, 72 migrating white storks were electrocuted in Sant Quirze de Besora, also in northern Catalonia. A further 93 were electrocuted in the area between 2019 and 2020.

This is a worldwide problem but it is particularly severe in Spain because the Iberian peninsula and the strait of Gibraltar lie on one of the principal avian migratory routes, with millions of birds crossing the Pyrenees every year.

According to the Spanish Ornithology Society (SEO), electrocution is the most common cause of death of golden and Bonelli’s eagles, both of which are endangered species. It is estimated that around 33,000 birds of prey are electrocuted every year in Spain.

While small birds may face little risk, for larger species there is the danger that when they spread their wings they touch an inadequately insulated pylon and become, fatally, part of the circuit.

Nicólas López, the SEO’s species conservation officer who was involved in investigating the case against Endesa, told the Guardian there are thousands of dangerous towers in Spain and approximately a million kilometres of electric cables.

“These cause the death not only of thousands of birds through electrocution but our report estimates around 5 million die through colliding with the cables,” he said.

“In France it’s thought that at least 1 million birds are electrocuted each year. A government report suggests that the figure in Spain is nearer 3 million.

“We’ve known about the problem and the measures that need to be taken to prevent electrocution since the 1980s, but they’re still putting up new lines that don’t comply with the regulations,” he said.

He adds that there’s little political will to put pressure on these companies, which are among the most powerful in Spain.

The cost of complying during the erection of new pylons is trivial, López says, but it is more expensive for existing pylons.

In the suit, Pelegrín points out that Endesa is subject to laws that oblige it “to adopt the necessary measures to avoid risks or damage incurred through transporting electricity not only to people but the flora, fauna and the environment in general”.

In 2013, Endesa presented the Catalan regional government with a plan to ensure its power lines conformed with legal requirements. However, the suit contends that, five years later, the company had only made piecemeal adjustments to its lines despite “having been required and repeatedly informed of the need to carry out a serious and effective plan to make safe these dangerous installations”.

The company, which has not formally responded to the charge, claims that this year it will invest €4.6m (£4m) in bird protection and that in 2020 it made safe 659 pylons at a cost of €2.2m.

In 2018, in a historic ruling, a court in Castilla-La Mancha fined an electricity company €149,920 for causing the death by electrocution of an Iberian imperial eagle, which is an endangered species.

López hopes the case against Endesa will increase pressure on companies to comply with environmental regulations.

“We think this case is really important because it isn’t just against the company but also brings criminal charges against six of its senior executives,” he said. “This makes it different from just fining the company, the cost of which they pass on to the consumer anyway. But we know they have a lot of money to hire lawyers and could drag the case out for years.”",720,4407,22,150

“If we are to truly unite in beating this virus, on behalf of the vaccine industry outside the U.S., I humbly request you to lift the embargo of raw material exports out of the U.S. so that vaccine production can ramp up,” wrote Adar Poonawalla, CEO of Serum Institute of India.

He had earlier told The Associated Press that pivoting away from suppliers in the U.S. could result in a delay of up to six months for the production of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Novavax. Serum Institute and Novavax have inked a deal to supply 1.1 billion doses of the vaccine to COVAX to equitably distribute it across the globe.

Separately, 10 Democratic senators are urging Biden to back India and South Africa’s appeal to the World Trade Organization to temporarily relax intellectual property rules so coronavirus vaccines can be manufactured by nations that are struggling to inoculate their populations.

The lawmakers, in a letter delivered to the White House on Thursday evening, wrote that Biden should “prioritize people over pharmaceutical company profits” and support the temporary waiver of the rules. A waiver, which is supported by more than 100 nations, could pave the way for generic or other manufacturers to make more vaccines.

India, in particular, is facing tremendous need. Serum Institute of India paused exports to COVAX after a devastating surge of infections in India resulted in increased domestic demand.

Over 200,000 new infections were detected in the past 24 hours, and major cities, like Mumbai and New Delhi, are under virus restrictions. Hospitals are overwhelmed, and authorities are scrambling to try to vaccinate enough people to slow down the spread. But in doing so, India relies heavily on AstraZeneca shots made by Serum Institute of India.

Poonawalla had said the unavailability of the raw materials, such as the specific medium needed to grow microorganisms, would prevent Serum Institute from scaling up the production of the vaccine developed by Novavax.

The company had been planning to make up to 40 million shots of the vaccine monthly.

Ramping up the production of this shot could also help India. Novavax has applied for authorization of the vaccine to regulators in Europe, the U.S. and the World Health Organization. If the vaccine is approved, India would be able to use it under new regulations that make it easier to greenlight vaccines that have received the nod by the U.K., the U.S., Europe, Japan or WHO.

The English conquest of Ireland in the 17th century was brutal, motivated by fear of invasion and facilitated by the superiority of Cromwell's army. The English takeover of Scotland in the 18th century was more pragmatic, born out of Scottish bankruptcy after an ill-fated American investment and English worries about France. But the resulting union was more than the sum of its parts: it gave birth to an intellectual and scientific revolution, centred on Edinburgh as well as London; an industrial revolution which grew out of that, enriching Glasgow as well as Manchester and Liverpool; an empire built as much by Scots as Englishmen; and a military power which helped save the world from fascism.

That union is now weaker than at any point in living memory. The causes are many, but Brexit is the most important. Political leaders in London, Edinburgh and Belfast have put their country at risk by the way they have managed Britain’s departure from the European Union.

Boris Johnson, the prime minister, has done it carelessly, by putting party above country and espousing a hard Brexit. The Scots never wanted to leave the EU and are inclined to seek a future outside the UK . In the past year opinion polls have shifted from a small majority backing the union—broadly the pattern since a referendum rejecting independence in 2014—to a small majority backing departure.

Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister and leader of the Scottish National Party, has done it determinedly, by exploiting Scots’ dislike of the Brexit settlement. The ills of fishermen unable to sell their catches are blamed on Westminster. Polls suggest that, in the Scottish elections in May, the SNP will gain an overall majority in a system designed to avoid it.

Arlene Foster, first minister of Northern Ireland and head of the Democratic Unionist Party ( DUP ), has done it stupidly, by rejecting the softer Brexit proposed by Theresa May, Mr Johnson's predecessor. That would have avoided the vexed issue of how and where to create a border with the EU . Neither Brussels, nor Dublin nor London was prepared to create a hard border on the island of Ireland, so Mr Johnson created one instead in the Irish Sea, between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, weakening the union which the DUP exists to defend. That helps explain a week of rioting earlier this month. Resentments fester and, as the 100th anniversary of Irish independence nears, reunification has never looked closer.

If the Scots, Northern Irish or even the Welsh choose to go their own way, they should be allowed to do so—but only once it is clearly their settled will. That is by no means the case yet, and this newspaper hopes it never will be.

Breaking up a country should never be done lightly, because it is a painful process—politically, economically and emotionally. Ask the Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis or the Serbs, Croats and other former citizens of Yugoslavia. Few splits happen as peaceably and easily as that of the Czechs and Slovaks. Though it seems inconceivable that the citizens of today’s UK would start murdering each other, that is exactly what they did during the Northern Irish Troubles that ended less than a quarter of a century ago.

When not bickering about the constitutional question, the UK ’s constituent parts work together fine. England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland ran separate covid-19 lockdowns, adjusted to local rates and sensitivities. Vaccines, where scale counts, were run nationally.

The UK ’s survival matters more broadly, too. Although its historical record is hardly unimpeachable, it is on the side of democracy, human rights and transparency in a nasty world. No doubt its constituent parts would embrace similar values, but when independent England or Scotland piped up in defence of Hong Kong, they would be easily ignored—especially if they lost their permanent seat on the UN Security Council.

The fact that the survival of the union is now in Mr Johnson’s unreliable hands will bring no comfort to anybody who hopes it has a future. Yet he is concerned enough to have created a “union unit” within Downing Street, and put it under Michael Gove, one of his cleverest colleagues and the government’s only high-profile non-English minister.

Some of what Mr Johnson is doing is sensible. He is right to insist that now is not the time for another Scottish referendum. The last one, only seven years ago, was advertised as a once-in-a-generation opportunity. It is true that Britain’s circumstances have since changed, but Brexit is very recent, and opinion about it has not had a chance to settle. There should not be another referendum until polls show a clear and sustained majority for independence. Holding frequent referendums is a recipe for instability and an eventual end to the union: at some point the trigger and the bullet will coincide.

But the government is getting much else wrong. It should stop plastering the Union Jack everywhere. To those whose identity is primarily regional, it looks like a campaign that is designed to stamp Westminster’s ownership on all corners of the nation. It should use non-English figures more, including Ruth Davidson, the popular former leader of the Scottish Conservative Party. Mr Johnson also needs to stop lying. His dishonesty over the Irish Sea border, which he said would be created “over [his] dead body”, exacerbated his betrayal of the province. And he needs to improve Britain’s relations with Europe, including by aligning Britain’s food-and-agriculture standards with those of the EU —the main source of the trade friction that has infuriated Northern Ireland’s unionists. That would make a trade deal with America harder, but no such deal is on offer now, and none ever will be if the peace in Northern Ireland is put in jeopardy.

You only had two jobs

Mr Johnson was elected prime minister to “get Brexit done”. In carrying that out, he has endangered his country's integrity. His single most important task for the rest of his term in office is to hold the union together. If he fails, he will go down in history not as the man who freed the United Kingdom, but as the man who destroyed it. ■

Then its own outbreak spiraled out of control.,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/04/india-covid-surge-vaccine-supply-elections.html,"On Friday, India reached a record of 217,000 COVID-19 infections in 24 hours, far outpacing any other country (and likely still undercounting the total, considering the subcontinent’s long-inadequate testing regime). This week, it surpassed Brazil as the second-most-infected country in the world, and is now only behind the United States in total infection and death rates. Reports of packed hospitals, low oxygen supply, overflowing crematoriums, and the spread of multiple variants abound. As alarming as this is for India itself, the increased global demand for vaccines and the deadly new variants developing within the country pose grave dangers for the rest of the world as well.

The easily transmissible B.1.1.7 strain, which originated in the United Kingdom, took root in the subcontinent as it has elsewhere—but it’s not the only variant of its kind, or even the most worrying. According to data from Johns Hopkins, in the first half of April, the state of Maharashtra not only had the single biggest cluster of new cases within the country, but within the entire Asian continent. Much of this is due to a so-called double mutant, which in India consists of both the easily transmissible strain first found in Brazil and South Africa as well as another mutation that helps the virus sidestep the body’s immune system. Neeraj Kaushik, a professor at the National Institute of Technology, mentioned other troubling features of the variant in a report for the Delhi Police, noting that the variant was infecting younger people, spreading faster among families and groups, avoiding detection in certain tests, and causing new symptoms. The National Institute of Virology in Pune studied hundreds of Maharashtra virus samples from January through March and found that 61 percent of them matched the characteristics of this double mutant. Initially, this mutation had been downplayed by both the state and national governments, despite the fact that it was first detected back in December; on Tuesday, Maharashtra’s chief minister kicked off a 15-day period where only “essential services” would function, though he took care not to refer to it as a lockdown, and also dispatched police to enforce safety measures.

Meanwhile, stories from last year’s pandemic impact are merely repeating themselves. Infections are spreading in other parts of India, like Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh, and states like Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh have either laid down new curfews or extended already-existing curfew hours; Delhi, the single most devastated metropolis, has shut down several business operations, including restaurants, and is also installing a curfew this weekend. Urban low-wage and domestic laborers, cut off from their livelihoods, are leaving in large numbers for their families’ remote villages, very possibly bringing the virus with them. Members of the Lancet COVID-19 Commission Task Force on Public Health are repeatedly urging Indians to take extra safety measures, stating that “vaccines won’t be enough” in the face of variants. Last week, New Zealand banned visitors from India, claiming that the surge it had recently seen at its border (i.e., 23 cases) was spurred mostly by 17 Indian travelers. Other countries have not forbidden flights from India yet, but it could happen soon.

Less than four months ago, the administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi had declared victory over the pandemic and got to work on what’s been projected to be the world’s largest vaccination campaign, approving the manufacture and use of the British AstraZeneca vaccine (branded in India as Covishield) as well as India’s own vaccine, Covaxin, crafted by domestic drugmaker Bharat Biotech. World Trade Organization intellectual property regulations still prevent India from producing generic forms of approved, branded vaccines—a baffling decision for many reasons, not least because the country’s cheap, effective generics are among its biggest exports—yet the country was still determined to not just vaccinate its native population but also give vaccines to its neighbors and allies. This was planned in large part as a counter to geopolitical rival China’s global vaccine distribution campaign. The United States was also happy to partner with India for the purpose of speeding up manufacturing and distribution.

In the first few months of 2021, the vaccine program did seem a startling success, even as COVID cases started to trickle upward (and were subsequently downplayed by the government). By this week, India claimed to have already distributed more than 100 million individual domestic vaccine doses—an impressive number that still wouldn’t even account for 8 percent of India’s population, not to mention that only 11 million people by this point have been fully vaccinated (all the currently available vaccines in India require two shots). The country’s External Affairs Ministry also claimed that, as of Friday, it had exported more than 65 million vaccines to at least 90 countries, mostly to developing nations that have struggled to obtain vaccines.

Yet with the virus still wrecking the country, optimism about India’s recovery has dwindled, and systems are rapidly readjusting. Vaccine rollout has slowed amid the latest surges, putting further benchmarks (including that of vaccinating 250 million “priority people” by July) out of reach and portending a yearslong slog toward herd immunity. Last month, the government halted Covishield exports in order to prioritize the native population; on Tuesday, it announced that it would grant emergency approvals to vaccines being used in other countries, including Russia’s Sputnik V. India is also trying to obtain the Pfizer vaccine, which its government had shrugged off in January after it had refused to sign an indemnity bond—a deal other countries with Pfizer contracts have agreed to—that would have inoculated the company from potential lawsuits over side effects. Moderna appears reluctant to take its product to India, while Johnson & Johnson is in talks with India’s government for a deal on the one-shot vaccine, although its recent pause in the U.S. might spur further skepticism among vaccine-hesitant Indians.

Meanwhile, regional vaccine reception is dependent on the national effort—and there, the rollout is increasingly flailing. At least 10 states have vaccine shortages in their areas, leading to vaccination sites closing down or turning people away; in turn, national leaders are denying that there is a shortage and instead are blaming the states for supposedly poor logistics. India’s Serum Institute, which is producing Covishield, has admitted publicly that its capacity is “very stressed.” Plus, Covaxin production is also bound to slow, in part due to lack of supply of a crucial ingredient sourced from the U.S.; as a result, states like Punjab are missing second doses for those who are on schedule to receive them. These logistical issues are compounding further troubles for Punjabi health officials, who already had trouble persuading vaccine-skeptical seniors to take the shots. And Indian vaccine hesitancy isn’t limited to old age: In other cities, poor urban laborers whose livelihoods were already affected by economic recession are shunning the vaccine, worrying that missing any time for work to get the shots will imperil their employment.

All this was sadly foreseeable. After a messy stay-at-home order in spring 2020 that displaced tens of millions of people from their homes, India never mandated more such large-scale restrictions, and individual states often had to come up with their own responses, with successful results in certain regions and dire ones in others. Throughout the pandemic, Modi and his ideological acolytes have mainly done what they’ve done best over the past seven years: downplay problems, fuel culture wars, and fail to address the consequences of their own policies and statements.

On Monday and Wednesday, 3 million maskless Hindus from across the nation gathered in tight crowds at the Ganga River to observe the Kumbh Mela holiday; hundreds of participants in Monday’s festivities have tested positive for the virus, and almost 200 devotees there were found to already have been positive when they reached the river. There is a notable contrast between the response from the Indian government and its ideological allies to this event and the reaction to Muslims who celebrated at religious events early on in the pandemic. Back in spring 2020, the hashtag #CoronaJihad dominated social media, and Muslims who’d held gatherings were disproportionately blamed for viral spread. Already, the Kumbh Mela case count far exceeds the numbers from Islamic observations, yet there will likely be no comparable uproar.

Religious festivities aren’t the only crowds likely playing a part in viral spread: Local political elections are ramping up. The states of Assam, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu are set to hold elections through the end of the month, despite the lack of distancing in political rallies and tense skirmishes at poll sites. These very states are experiencing high case upticks, yet federal government officials are still prioritizing events in states like West Bengal, whose local elections are being perceived as a referendum on Modi’s conservative Bharatiya Janata Party.

But it’s not just poor public examples that other countries have to fear from India—it’s also the supply of vaccines. India’s Covishield had become an essential part of COVAX, a World Health Organization–backed initiative to get vaccines to lower-income nations; by late March, India had supplied almost 30 million doses for COVAX’s use. With India keeping Covishield totally domestic for now, countries without strong manufacturing bases or health systems that benefited from India’s vaccine generosity will lose out, and the COVAX effort itself will have to slow down. Regions of the world with enhanced vaccine production capacity, including the U.S. and the European Union, remain stingy with vaccine sharing, while a Chinese government official recently cast doubt on the efficacy of his own country’s domestic and exported vaccines. Because of all this, more than 85 of the world’s poorest countries may not have sufficient vaccine access before 2023, according to the Economist. India’s vaccine generosity had helped plug the gap left by other heavyweights, but its domestic reprioritization may now have the unfortunate effect of putting dependent nations at higher risk for viral spread, economic shutdown, and variant emergence. Speaking of variants: Maharashtra’s double mutant has now been found in at least eight other countries. With the rapid global reach of the British, South African, and Brazilian variants, it likely won’t be long before India’s variant also establishes a deadly hold.

Speaking ahead of a global summit on the climate crisis this week that will be helmed by US President Joe Biden, Mr Kerry said the need to tackle the climate issue was “extremely urgent”.

“The word ‘urgent’ is totally applicable to the current crisis that we’re in because countries are simply not getting the job done,” Mr Kerry said in an interview with Sky News’ Sophy Ridge on Sunday.

“Even if we did everything that we set out to do in the Paris Agreement, the Earth’s temperature is going to increase a very significant amount, perhaps as much as 3.7 degrees or more,” the climate envoy said. “And the reason for the real urgency now is that because we’re not getting done what we said we’d do in Paris, it’s actually heading towards 4 degrees or more.”

“That’s beyond catastrophic in the consequences to food production, water, habitability in various parts of the planet, the melting of ice, the sea level rise, the warming - all the consequences,” he said.

Noting the US’s role in that, particularly with Mr Trump having withdrawn the US from the Paris Agreement - a decision Mr Biden reversed on his first day in office, Mr Kerry apologised for the former administration’s actions.

“We are very sorry for the last four years with a president who didn’t care about science and who didn’t have a real rationale for pulling out, but he was the only president in the world, the only leader in the world, who pulled out of this [Paris] agreement,” Mr Kerry said.

“President Biden said the first thing he’d do as president is return; we’ve done that and now with this summit we’re going to try and bring nations to the table to do what we need to do to get the job done for future generations,” he said.

“...This is why we bring nations together and, unfortunately, the United States became a renegade in the last four years under the non-leadership of President Trump, but we are now back and present with a very aggressive series of initiatives in order to try to make up for lost time.”

More than 16,000 civilian contractors, including over 6,000 Americans, now provide security, logistics and other support in Afghanistan, according to recent figures compiled by the Pentagon. Top military officials on Wednesday played down any significant role for civilian contractors in combating Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, although some analysts say they could be used to train Afghan security forces.

Under Mr. Biden’s order, the United States is withdrawing 2,500 troops from Afghanistan, but the Pentagon actually has about 1,000 more troops on the ground there than it has publicly acknowledged. The murky accounting results from some Special Operations forces having been put “off the books,” Pentagon officials say, to include some elite Army Rangers, who work under both the Pentagon and the C.I.A. while deployed to Afghanistan.

The Obama administration used similar sleights of hand under the bureaucratic term “force management levels,” which resulted in more troops in war zones with little public oversight.

But Pentagon officials said they would not resort to those tactics to slip undisclosed troops into Afghanistan after the departure deadline, even though some analysts voiced skepticism.

KURNOOL: People celebrated Telugu New Year Ugadi in a unique way in Kurnool on Wednesday. A day after Ugadi, Kairuppa villagers hurled cow dung cakes at one another as part of the Ugadi celebrations and people in Kalluru took out a procession of donkeys during the Chowdeswari Utsavams. In Kairuppala village of Aspari mandal, people celebrated Peddanuggulata, also called pidakala samara (fighting with cow dung cakes).

The villagers divided into two groups and hurled cow dung cakes at one another when a procession of Lord Veerabhadra Swamy was taken out. The dung cakes were made a month ahead of the celebration.

This celebration has a myth behind it. When Veerabhadra Swamy, a Lingayat, wanted to marry Kalika Devi, a woman from the SC community, there was a clash between the two communities. To bring about peace, the village headmen sat together and arranged the marriage and all was well again.

Continuing the tradition, the village heads sit together after the dung fight and perform the marriage of Veerabhadra Swamy. People from Lingayat, Reddy and Muslim communities represent Veerabhadra Swamy’s side while the SC, Yadav and Kuruma communities represent Kalika’s side. As many as 100 persons were injured in the traditional fight, but no one complained to the police, Aspari sub-inspector Giri Babu said. Similarly, the Chowdeswari Ugadi Utsavam in Kalluru locality of Kurnool Municipal Corporation limit was also held in a different way.

Sludge was arranged for about 3-feet depth around the Chowdeswari temple and donkeys were made to cross it. On every Ugadi, donkeys are taken on a procession to the temple from different parts of Kurnool. The animals are made to go around the temple through the sludge. After the perambulation, the donkeys are given a bath, decorated and worshiped. “It is believed that making the donkeys walk in the slush will usher in peace and prosperity in the society,” temple priest Srinivasa said.",320,1972,29,160

As Covid-19 cases in India continue to rise steadily, Serum Institute of India (SII) CEO Adar Poonawalla on Friday appealed to US President Joe Biden to lift the embargo on export of raw materials needed to manufacture vaccines out of the United States so that vaccine production can be fast-tracked.

Tagging Biden on Twitter, Poonawalla wrote, “Respected @POTUS, if we are to truly unite in beating this virus, on behalf of the vaccine industry outside the U.S., I humbly request you to lift the embargo of raw material exports out of the U.S. so that vaccine production can ramp up.

Vaccines are running out of stock in a number of states who have already raised the issue with the Centre.

In an interview to NDTV tweeted by the channel earlier this month, Poonawalla had said SII, that is manufacturing Covishield, would require around Rs 3,000 crore to ramp up its Covid-19 vaccine production capacity. “We need roughly Rs 3,000 crores which is not a small figure considering we have already spent thousands of crores. We have to find other innovative ways to build our capacity so we can support our nation in light of Covid surge,” he said, adding that the vaccine industry has sacrificed millions of dollars to support the nation.

The company currently has the capacity to produce 60 to 70 million doses per month, he said.

At present, India is immunising frontline workers, people with co-morbidities and all others above 45 years of age with either of two vaccines — SII’s Covishield and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. Apart from this, clinical trials of SII’s Covovax have also begun and the company plans to launch it by September this year.",372,2206,22,162
0,Human Rights Lawyer Steve Donziger faces a court case for criminal contempt after decades fighting to prove Chevron’s responsibility polluting the Amazon rainforest,https://bylinetimes.com/2021/04/15/the-decades-long-persecution-of-human-rights-lawyer-by-oil-giant/,"Steve Donziger faces a court case for criminal contempt after decades fighting to prove Chevron’s responsibility polluting the Amazon rainforest, reports Stephen Delahunty

Share EmailTwitterFacebook

US-based lawyer Steve Donziger has spent more than 600 days of house arrest after enduring what he described as a “corporate political persecution” following decades-long legal battle with the oil giant Chevron.

In 2011, Donziger and a team of Ecuadorian lawyers won a $9.5-billion verdict against Texaco, now Chevron, in a case of massive oil pollution he referred to as the “Amazon Chernobyl”. It is the largest, and arguably the most bitter, human rights and environmental court battle in history.

Since then, a series of litigations involving a US judge acting as prosecutor and jury on behalf of a massive oil company have resulted in a misdemeanor charge brought against the human rights lawyer. The charge carries a maximum sentence of six months in prison.

Donziger’s contempt charge will be heard by Judge Loretta Preska who was on the advisory board of the New York chapter of the Chevron-funded Federalist Society. The Seward & Kissel law firm – that has previously done work for Chevron – will prosecute Donziger after the US Justice Department declined to take the case.

Despite increasing domestic and international calls for the case to be thrown out, this month Preska denied all Zoom access to Donziger’s upcoming trial in a move his lawyers said is designed to limit public access to an unparalleled one-sided case.

Marty Garbus, the lawyer representing Donziger, condemned the move as an “obvious and transparent attempt to hide public scrutiny of a farcical proceeding with a biased judge, no jury, and a private Chevron prosecutor.”

A ‘Lifetime of Litigation’

The history of Donziger’s investigations into reports of pollution in the Lago Agrio region of northern Ecuador began in 1993 – although Texaco had been drilling in this part of the Amazon since the 1960s.

When Chevron bought Texaco in 2001, it argued the oil company had cleaned up its area of operations. Any remaining pollution, it claimed, was the responsibility of its partner Petroecuador.

However, evidence has shown that between 1964 and 1992, Texaco dumped 16 billion gallons of toxic wastewater into rivers and pits. The pollution flowed into rivers and streams used by the indigenous population for drinking water. Amazon Frontlines, a human rights group, estimates there are still 1,785 pools and 704 open pits of toxic wastes registered in the Lago Agrio region.

Judicial site inspections confirmed that the average Chevron waste pit in Ecuador contained 200 times the contamination allowed by US and world standards. This included illegal levels of metals known to damage the immune and reproductive systems and cause cancer. According to Amazon Watch, the company saved about $3 per barrel of oil by ignoring regulations, and earned an extra $5 billion over 20 years.

Donziger travelled to Ecuador hundreds of times while building the case before the legal action eventually went to court. During the trial, Chevron stated that if the victims pursued the case, they faced a “lifetime of litigation.”

After an eight-year trial, in 2011 the court ruled that 30,000 plaintiffs – mostly farmers and indigenous people – should be awarded billions of dollars to clean up the contaminated soil and improve the region’s health facilities.

Two Ecuadorian appeals courts confirmed the decision, and seventeen appellate judges ruled unanimously that Chevron was responsible for the pollution in an area covering 1,700-square miles.

The historic victory was short-lived.

Chevron claimed Donziger’s team ghost wrote a supposedly independent assessment and offered a $500,000 bribe to sway the judgment.

Donziger denied any wrongdoing and Ecuador’s Supreme Court later affirmed the original ruling, but Chevron refused to pay and sold up all its assets in the country.

Chevron then hired law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher – previously censured by England’s High Court of Justice for fabricating evidence – to file a ‘racketeering’ case against Donziger. This charge is normally reserved for prosecuting organised crime syndicates.

Judge Kaplan at the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York agreed to hear the case. However, on the eve of the trial Chevron dropped its financial claims which allowed Kaplan to dismiss the jury and decide the outcome himself.

A key Chevron witness was Alberto Guerra – a former Ecuadorian judge who had historically testified that he accepted bribes.

Guerra claimed that Donziger had approved a “bribe” to an Ecuadorian judge and written the final court ruling for the judge, allegedly transferred on a computer thumb drive. No corroborating evidence was ever offered. Guerra later admitted lying about these facts, proven by an investigation of his computer.

Despite this, Kaplan found Donziger conducted a “pattern of racketeering activity” which made him liable for millions of dollars in Chevron’s legal costs.

The oil company was also granted seizure of his laptop and cellphone, which Donziger refused.

This resulted in the current charge of ‘criminal contempt’ and Kaplan assigning the case to Judge Preska in August 2019.

Donziger has been under house arrest since.

In a lengthy statement sent to Byline Times, a spokesman for Chevron contended that an international tribunal in 2017 had confirmed the Ecuadorian decision was “fraudulent” and he denied the company had persecuted Donziger.

However, Ecuador is appealing this particular tribunal decision. The appeal is administered by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, in part on its findings of judicial fraud in the case.

Ecuador’’s attorney general, Inigo Salvador, said “it worries us that the tribunal is asking a country to lift a sentence of one of its courts that was issued as part of a dispute between private parties.”

A Corporate Political Prosecution

Donziger has been unable to practice law while detained. He says his battle with Chevron has come at a huge personal, family and financial cost.

“I never thought this could happen in the US,” Donziger said. He explained how he believes this his case is designed to give a warning and marks the opening of a new front in the war against environmental defenders.

“This is a corporate political prosecution,” he added. His lawyers have estimated the oil giant has spent over $2 billion on 2,000 lawyers, public relations teams, and private investigators.

However, Donziger has global allies. The Law Students for Climate Accountability organised a national boycott of the firm for its willingness to “use its legal skills in the interest of high paying companies.”

More than 475 international lawyers, bar associations, and human rights advocates signed a letter criticising Kaplan’s ruling for persecuting Donziger “based on false witness testimony provided by Chevron, personal animus, and… to protect Chevron from a valid foreign court judgment.”

The letter added: “Such arbitrary detention sets a dangerous precedent for human rights attorneys in the United States and around the world.”

They’re joined by the European Parliament, who has called for an investigation into Chevron’s and Gibson Dunn’s conduct.

Additionally, more than 50 Nobel laureates have made their feelings clear in a letter of support for Donziger and the indigenous peoples and communities in Ecuador and their decades-long struggle for environmental justice. It states: “[Chevron’s] goal is to intimidate and disempower the victims of its pollution and a lawyer who has worked for decades on their behalf.”

Amnesty International has also called on the US justice department to conduct a criminal investigation into the oil company and Gibson Dunn’s conduct, witness bribery, and fraud in the Ecuador pollution litigation.

A Dirtier Turn

As the trial draws closer, The Daily Dot discovered last month that searches for terms related to the case on Google throw up sponsored ads by Chevron, in an attempt to bump down articles that are more favorable and sympathetic to Donziger.

It’s also using public relations wires to help push its story, as well as an actual sock puppet Twitter account from their PR head.

A spokesman for Chevron told Byline Times that the oil giant is not involved in the contempt case.

“Donziger has no one to blame but himself for his problems,” the spokesman said. “The court initiated the pending criminal case against him.”

Rick Friedman, Donziger’s longtime counsel, said the case illustrates the wisdom of the founding fathers in having “checks and balances” in the Government, and called on the US Justice Department to intervene and dismiss the case outright.

“The judiciary has ignored the executive branch which is ordinarily in charge of prosecutions. It has eliminated a jury, which historically has been a bulwark against judicial overreach. It is punishing a defendant before he has been convicted. If the trial does happen, it is imperative that an unbiased judge and disinterested prosecutor be assigned to the case.”

Despite his cases’ narrative turning into one of his own persecution, Donziger reminded his supporters there are ten of thousands people in Ecuador still awaiting justice for a massive environmental pollution.

His trial for criminal contempt is scheduled to begin behind closed doors next month.

Using satellite and drone footage, company records, photographs and other data, investigators have released floor plans and some of the first photographs of an expanded residence near Valdai, which they said was the Russian president’s favourite and most secret.

They claimed the residence was partly leased from one of Putin’s closest allies on taxpayer money. While some of the lakeside property is state-owned and designated for official use, a more lavish section with a mansion has been privately developed into what has been described as a playground for the health-conscious head of state.

In particular, the investigation focuses on a 7,000 sq metre (75,000 sq ft) spa complex whose floor plans show a float pool, massage rooms, a swimming pool, and other amenities, such as an extreme-cold treatment cryotherapy chamber, that are rented from a company alleged to belong to one of Putin’s close friends.

Company statements showed that the owner of the complex has made more than 2.7bn roubles (£25.8m) in the past decade.

The investigation was released as Navalny remains on hunger strike in a Russian prison and his supporters are being pressurised by the government not to continue protests against his two-and-a-half year sentence on embezzlement charges.

The emails of more than 500,000 Navalny supporters, many of whom had signed up online to attend new protests against the Kremlin, was leaked to journalists this week by an anonymous group that called the Navalny team “losers” and claimed the database was heavily populated with bots.

Navalny’s team confirmed that the leaked database was real, but did not say if any of the emails were run by automated accounts. It apologised to those on the list, saying the leak contained only emails and no other personal information. The leak came as Navalny’s team is closing in on collecting 500,000 online signatures in order to launch new protests calling for the opposition leader’s freedom.

“[The database] is real as opposed to the fakes that were released earlier,” wrote Ivan Zhdanov, the director of the group. “It’s happening now, when the campaign needs just 70,000 more signatures and every confirmation to attend the protests is much harder for us to collect.”

In a message posted online on Friday Navalny said that he was being threatened with being force-fed in a straitjacket unless he ended a hunger strike in protest against his treatment in a Russian prison. He has demanded to be seen by his doctor for reported numbness in his back and legs, which he says may be linked to the poisoning attempt on his life that took place last year.

His wife earlier this week said he looked gaunt during his meeting with her and he had lost an estimated 16kg since arriving at a prison colony about 60 miles east of Moscow last month.

“He is still as cheerful and upbeat as ever,” Yulia Navalnaya wrote in an online post on Wednesday. “He speaks with difficulty, though, and from time to time he hangs up the phone and leans on the table to take a break. He has lost a lot of weight … and weighs 76kg.”

Some of the anger at the Kremlin has been sparked by a previous investigation into a Black Sea dacha that was said to cost nearly £1bn and to have been established for the special use of the president, although recent photographs suggest that it was no longer in use. That residence included flourishes such as an “aqua-disco” and a wine cave dug into a cliff overlooking the Black Sea.

The investigation into that residence, which has been called Putin’s Palace, came after Navalny’s arrest upon returning to Russia in January and showed that the opposition leader remained a danger to the Kremlin even while behind bars.

The authors of the new investigation concluded it with a call for his freedom. “Putin illegally imprisoned Navalny for telling the truth about his corruption, lies, and duplicity. We will continue to tell this truth.”",706,4253,25,170
0,Anger as Tory MPs vote against register for stalkers and domestic abusers. Government rejects measures despite briefing they would support them after death of Sarah Everard,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/apr/16/anger-tory-mps-vote-against-register-stalkers-domestic-abusers,"The government is facing growing anger after voting against putting serial stalkers and domestic abusers on a national register, despite briefing they were likely to support the measures following the death of Sarah Everard.

Conservative MPs voted against amendments to the domestic abuse bill on Thursday that would have placed serial domestic abusers and stalkers on the current Violent and Sex Offender Register (Visor).

MPs also voted down House of Lords-supported amendments that would have given family court judges training on sexual abuse and provided greater protection to migrant victims of domestic violence.

The stalking amendment gained overwhelming support in the Lords last month and the home secretary, Priti Patel, suggested the government was likely to support the measures, telling MPs: “There is something about perpetrators and their serial offending that has to be addressed. There is no question about that at all … I will be very candid: we will look at all measures.”

After the death of Sarah Everard, government sources told the Sunday Times that the move also had the backing of the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, while a Change.org petition urging the government to introduce the stalkers’ register has attracted almost 250,000 signatures.

All but two Conservative MPs voted against the amendment to add persistent stalkers and domestic abusers to a national register. It was defeated 351 to 227.

Domestic abuse and stalking survivors and campaigners were disappointed and frustrated, said Sophie Francis-Cansfield, the senior campaigns and policy officer at Women’s Aid.

“Domestic abuse remains underreported and only a small proportion of survivors see criminal sanctions against their perpetrator – a register could have been a useful tool,” she said. “We have to find ways to proactively hold perpetrators to account and prioritise survivors’ safety.”

The domestic abuse campaigner David Challen, whose mother, Sally Challen, spent decades as a victim of her husband’s coercive and controlling behaviour, said the government was putting countless lives at risk by not creating a register to monitor abusers. “Abusers and stalkers commit a pattern of violent acts across multiple victims, this register was a vital opportunity to track and stop this violence,” he said.

The decision to exclude migrant women from protections offered under the new bill was “deeply troubling”, said Pragna Patel of Southall Black Sisters, which is taking part in a government pilot project to support migrant women and address an “evidence gap” around the need for support. “Copious evidence already exists,” she said. “The pilot is no substitute to the need for meaningful, long-term measures of protection for some of the most vulnerable women in our society. We will not be celebrating the bill when it becomes law because it is not a bill for all women.”

Jess Phillips, the shadow domestic violence minister, said the decision to vote against the amendments pointed to a government “hellbent on working with a clearly broken system that leaves violent criminals without management and has already left many women for dead”.

The decision to exclude migrant women from protections offered to other victims in the bill was “driven by ideology rather than reality”, she said, adding: “Foreign students, people working in our care system and across our country completely legally have been offered up a narrow system that will inevitably leave many with no choice but to return to violence and abuse.”

Lucy Hadley, the head of policy and campaigns at Women’s Aid, said it was “deeply disappointing” that the government had rejected the Lords’ amendments to give migrant women equal protection, adding that currently just 4% of refuges in England could accept a woman with no recourse to public funds due to immigration status. “All survivors must have the right to seek help and live a life free from abuse – regardless of their immigration status,” she said. “This law has been deemed a once-in-a-generation opportunity to protect all survivors, but there is much more to do.”

The government’s decision to vote down a requirement for all family court judges to have training on domestic abuse and sexual violence was “unbelievable”, said Dr Charlotte Proudman, an expert on gender-based violence and family law.

“I’m devastated,” she said. “The government’s harm report and three domestic abuse appeals show that the family courts are failing women and children leaving them in situations of harm.”

A government spokesperson said: “There has been no U-turn. The Lords amendment is not calling for a register, but instead changes to multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA).

“The government agrees that high-harm domestic abuse perpetrators need to be effectively monitored and supervised, which is why serial and high-harm domestic abuse offenders are eligible for management under MAPPA. Adding a new category of offenders automatically eligible for MAPPA risks adding complexity to those arrangements without any gain.”",789,5066,26,172
0,‘It’s a day off’: Transcripts of conversations between Italian officials and Libyan coastguard contained in leaked file show people on dinghies in distress were left to die,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/16/wiretaps-migrant-boats-italy-libya-coastguard-mediterranean,"At 8.18am on Friday 16 June 2017, the Libyan coastguard Col Massoud Abdalsamad received a long-distance phone call from an Italian coastguard official who told him that 10 migrant dinghies were in distress, many in Libyan territorial waters.

“It’s a day off. It’s a holiday here. But I can try to help,” Abdalsamad told the official. “Perhaps we can be there tomorrow.”

Later that day Abdalsamad claimed that his men had saved many of the stricken migrants. According to data compiled by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), by the end of the weekend, 126 people had died.

In February of that year, Europe had ceded responsibility for overseeing Mediterranean rescue operations to Libya as part of a deal struck between Italy and Libya aimed at reducing migrant flows across the sea.

The conversation, recorded by prosecutors in Sicily investigating sea rescue charities for alleged complicity in people-smuggling, lays bare the indifference of individuals on the Libyan side to the plight of migrants and to international law.

It is one of several revelations from the transcripts of wiretaps on Libyan coastguard officials’ phones, contained in a leaked 30,000-page file produced by Italian prosecutors that has been seen by the Guardian.

The revelations are being published as part of a joint investigation by the Guardian, the Italian public broadcaster Rai News and the Domani newspaper. They appear to show that Italian authorities knew that Libyan authorities were either unwilling or incapable of looking after migrant boats at sea, even as Italy launched investigations into the role of nongovernmental organisation boats at sea that prevented NGOs from carrying out private rescue operations.

Between 22 and 27 March 2017, hundreds of people who had set off from Sabratha in Libya requested aid from the Italian maritime rescue coordination centre. The transcripts show that Italian officials attempted to contact Abdalsamad and at least two other officials a number of times, but often the “result was negative”. The Italian authorities eventually lost contact with the dinghies. On 29 March the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) confirmed the deaths of 146 people, including children and many pregnant women.

On 24 May 2017, two boats that had left Libya carrying hundreds of people started taking in water and one capsized. The people on board contacted the Italian coastguard, which called Abdalsamad 55 times without receiving a reply. Thirty-three people died, according to the UNHCR.

In a restricted 2018 report by Operation Sophia, the European mission to fight illegal immigration, which has been seen by the Guardian, officials wrote that “reporting by Libyan Coast Guard it is not yet at a consistently acceptable standard” and that “the lack of feedback provided by the Joint Operation Room continues to be an issue”. The report highlighted “a critical infrastructure situation (limited communication systems, power supply, telephones and personal computers)” and said the situation was “further adversely conditioned by a limited presence of personnel with insufficient language (English) skills”.

For years Libyan authorities have been accused of intercepting dinghies and returning people to detention centres in Libya, where aid agencies say they suffer torture and abuse.

Riccardo Gatti, head of mission for the Spanish NGO rescue boat Proactiva Open Arms, said it was “almost always impossible” to contact the Libyans, and that phone numbers often don’t work or are nonexistent.

Francesco Creazzo, a spokesperson for the NGO rescue boat SOS Méditerranée, said Libyan authorities were “mostly unresponsive, regardless of the day of the week”.

“The delays in communication at sea and the lack of capacity to coordinate from the Libyan JRCC [joint rescue coordination centre] further endangers people’s lives and has an unacceptable human cost,” said Ellen van der Velden, Médecins sans Frontiéres search and rescue operations manager.

“The crux of the matter, however, remains that the EU is prioritising surveillance of the borders over search and rescue, and has given the responsibility of maritime coordination in a large part of the sea to the JRCC.”

In a document produced by Italian prosecutors, investigators describe Abdalsamad as “uncollaborative”, adding that in the 16 June incident he denied “authorisation of an NGO vessel in Libyan waters to rescue two dinghies that were adrift”.

Later that same day, Abdalsamad informed Rome that the Libyan coastguard had intercepted five dinghies and rescued hundreds of people, but prosecutors have not produced any documents corroborating that statement.

Reached by the Guardian, Abdalsamad said that he was unable to answer any questions relating to events in 2017 because “it would be too hard to find the recordings of these events”. However, he did acknowledge that “communications with his Italian counterparts do not always work well” and that there were “telecommunication problems in Libya that cause frequent interruptions”.

“You must understand that Libya is a country that has suffered a war,” he said.

The Sicilian magistrates who wiretapped Abdalsamad for months as part of their investigation into NGOs have not indicted any Libyan officials.

Last week the Italian justice ministry announced that it had sent inspectors to Trapani in Sicily to “urgently carry out the necessary preliminary investigations” into the prosecutors’ inquiry after reports that at least 15 journalists covering the NGO case and human rights lawyers had been recorded in conversation with confidential sources.

Trapani’s acting head prosecutor, Maurizio Agnello, said in a statement that he “believes it is most opportune and responsible for me not to participate in any further discussions in this matter”.",999,6446,27,172

Former Peruvian President Martín Vizcarra has been banned from holding public office for 10 years in a unanimous vote by the country’s congress after he allegedly jumped the queue to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

Vizcarra was found guilty of influence peddling, collusion and making false declarations in relation to Peru’s VIP Vaccines scandal which saw many ministers and public officials receive Sinopharm vaccines before they were publicly available in the country.

Congress approved his temporary banning from public office by 86 votes in favour and zero against.

It also disqualified the former Health Minister Pilar Mazzetti from holding public office for eight years; and former Foreign Minister Elizabeth Astete for a year.

Both former ministers received the vaccine and resigned during the subsequent scandal. However, all three have denied having used their positions to obtain early access to vaccines.

Vizcarra said in February he and his wife were inoculated in October of the previous year as volunteers for the Sinopharm trial in Peru – a claim the university hosting the trial denied.

The former president came to office in March 2018 on a promise to curb endemic corruption in public office and ran the country until being impeached by Congress in November last year on separate corruption charges, which he has continued to deny.

He had been due to take up a seat in Congress following elections in Peru at the weekend, having obtained the highest number of votes cast for any legislator.

Sinopharm’s clinical trials in Peru took place between September and the end of 2020 with about 12,000 volunteers. In addition, local managers of the trial received 3,200 additional doses intended for personnel related to the research, host university Cayetano Heredia said.

Peru heads for a second round of voting for president in June, with right-wing presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori going head-to-head with socialist Pedro Castillo, a previously little-known union leader and teacher, who shocked the Andean nation by taking 19.1 percent of the vote during the first round of ballot last Sunday.",352,2230,26,173

Johnson asked Edward Lister, his special envoy for the Gulf, to take up the issue, and Lord Lister reportedly told the prime minister: “I’m on the case. I will investigate.”

The message stemmed from an attempt by a consortium led by the sovereign wealth fund, the Saudi Public Investment Fund, to buy Newcastle from its current owner, Mike Ashley.

A deal was agreed in April last year, which was then scrutinised by the Premier League under its owners’ and directors’ test, because the league had doubts about the independence of the bid team from the Saudi government. In July the consortium, which described itself as an “autonomous and purely commercial investor”, withdrew from the deal, blaming an “unforeseeably prolonged process”.

The Daily Mail, which first reported on the lobbying attempt by Prince Mohammed, said the message to Johnson was sent on 27 June and read: “We expect the English Premier League to reconsider and correct its wrong conclusion.”

Lister told the Mail: “The Saudis were getting upset. We were not lobbying for them to buy it or not to buy it. We wanted [the Premier League] to be straightforward and say ‘yes’ or ‘no’, don’t leave [the Saudis] dangling.”

Johnson and his ministers have shown sympathy for the bid but do not have the direct power to overrule the Premier League.

In August, Johnson, aware of how popular the bid had been with some football fans in north-east England, wrote to members of the Newcastle United Supporters Trust: “I appreciate many Newcastle fans were hoping this takeover bid would go ahead and can understand their sense of disappointment. I have seen the recent email sent to Newcastle fans from the Independent Football Ombudsman and agree with their conclusion that the Premier League should make a statement on this case.”

Saudi Arabia has long been jealous of its arch rival Qatar’s involvement in Paris Saint-Germain football club, and the involvement of a United Arab Emirates consortium in Manchester City.

In February this year the Biden administration released a declassified intelligence report which concluded that Prince Mohammed had approved the 2018 murder of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Human rights groups say the Saudi government has acted with impunity since 2018, including through arbitrary arrests of critics of the prince, as well as his potential political rivals.

“The bid to buy Newcastle was a blatant example of Saudi sportswashing, so it’s worrying that the prime minister would accede in any way to pressure from the crown prince over the deal,” said Amnesty International’s UK director, Kate Allen.

Freedom of information requests show the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport bombarded the Premier League in June 2020 with updates on how the decision on the bid was going. The DCMS said the Foreign Office’s Saudi desk was involved in responding to the decision, showing the political sensitivity of the issue for the UK government.

The DCMS argues that the emails do not represent pressure, merely requests to keep the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, abreast of the decisions.

The tensions at the top of the government over the role of Prince Mohammed are revealed in the diaries of the former Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan, which were published this week.

On 10 October 2018, soon after the murder of Khashoggi, Duncan wrote: “The Saudi issue is massive. He was murdered and sliced up. It’s a gamechanger. I think we should take a lead at international level by saying we love the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia but have growing doubts about MBS. Aim for the man and not the country. We should … but we cannot afford to … so we won’t.”

Elsewhere in his diaries, he accuses Prince Mohammed of “bombing Yemen to bits”. Duncan wrote that, acting on a tip-off, he had offered to provide Johnson with a list of disappeared Saudi princes.

Amnesty said: “At the time that the crown prince was putting this pressure on No 10, the world was still reeling from the fallout over Khashoggi’s murder, Saudi human rights activists like Loujain al-Hathloul were languishing in jail, and Saudi warplanes were indiscriminately bombing Yemen.

“This whole tangled affair only underlines how there needs to be a proper overhaul of the Premier League’s owners’ and directors’ test to provide proper human rights scrutiny of who is trying to buy into the glamour and prestige of English football.”

0,Myanmar shadow gov’t demands invite for ASEAN summit talks: Parallel ‘national unity government’ says it wants to take part in crisis talks scheduled for next week in Indonesia.,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/18/myanmar-shadow-govt-demands-invite-for-asean-summit-talks,"Parallel ‘national unity government’ says it wants to take part in crisis talks scheduled for next week in Indonesia.

Myanmar’s shadow government has urged Southeast Asian leaders to give it a seat at the table during crisis talks next week, and not to recognise the military rulers that seized power in a February coup.

Military government leader Senior General Min Aung Hlaing is expected to join a special ASEAN summit on Myanmar on Saturday in Jakarta, Indonesia – his first official overseas trip since the coup that overthrew civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

Moe Zaw Oo, deputy minister of foreign affairs for the parallel “national unity government” – formed on Friday by overthrown politicians mostly from Aung San Suu Kyi’s party, as well as ethnic-minority politicians – said ASEAN had not reached out to them.

“If ASEAN wants to help solve the Myanmar situation, they are not going to achieve anything without consulting and negotiating with the NUG, which is supported by the people and has full legitimacy,” he told Voice of America’s Burmese service on Sunday.

“It’s important that this military council is not recognised. This needs to be handled carefully.”

On Saturday, Thai foreign ministry spokesman Tanee Sangrat said several leaders of the 10 ASEAN countries, including Min Aung Hlaing, had confirmed they would attend the April 24 meeting in Jakarta.

The military strongman’s invitation has drawn scorn from activists who have urged foreign leaders not to formally recognise the military government.

The Southeast Asian nation has been in upheaval since the coup on February 1.

Security forces have killed at least 730 pro-democracy protesters, according to an activist group, in an attempt to crush nationwide anti-coup protests.

Meanwhile, security forces also continued targeting the media on Sunday, arresting Japanese freelance reporter Yuki Kitazumi.

He was arrested at his home in Yangon on Sunday evening, his assistant said in a message.

In February, he was beaten up and briefly detained during a crackdown on protesters but was later released.

The number of reporters arrested so far has totalled more than 65 and at least 34 remain in custody, according to monitoring group Reporting ASEAN.

Authorities announced on Sunday night on state-run television another 20 celebrities and 20 more doctors would be added to their arrest warrant list of 420 prominent people.

Protests continue

Earlier unrest continued across the country on Sunday, with protesters rallying in Mandalay, Meiktila, Magway and Myingyan, showing support for the national unity government.

At Palaw in the country’s south, demonstrators brandished banners that read: “Military dictators should not be allowed to rule. The dictatorship will be uprooted. Support the national unity government.”

Young demonstrators also staged motorbike rallies while carrying flags in Hpakant and Sagaing.

The previous night, there were violent clashes in the central gem-producing city of Mogok when security forces cracked down on protesters.

According to an AFP news agency-verified video filmed by a resident, soldiers crouched on a street as their commanding officer shouted that he wanted “deaths”.

The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) verified two deaths at Mogok.

Late on Saturday, a young man was shot and killed in Kyaukme town in northern Shan state while riding his motorbike during the curfew.

“He was shot by the authorities when he and other his friends drove motorbikes around 9pm. He was shot in the head,” a rescue worker told AFP news agency, adding that his funeral would take place on Sunday.

Much of Myanmar remains under a curfew imposed shortly after the coup, running from 8pm to 4am every night.",591,3751,28,177
0,Clashes in Pakistan after TLP takes several police hostage: Police say they launched a security operation after a right-wing group took six security personnel hostage in Lahore.,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/18/clashes-in-pakistan-after-tlp-takes-several-police-hostage,"Police say they launched a security operation after a right-wing group took six security personnel hostage in Lahore.

Police in Pakistan said a right-wing group has taken six security personnel hostage at its headquarters in Lahore on Sunday after a week of violent clashes following the arrest of the group’s leader.

Pakistan’s government banned Tehreek-e-Labbaik (TLP) Pakistan earlier this week after supporters took to the streets to protest against the arrest of their leader, Muslim scholar Saad Rizvi.

“Today in the early morning, miscreants attacked Nawankot Police Station where [paramilitary] Rangers and police officers were trapped inside the police station and [Deputy Superintendent] Nawankot [was] kidnapped,” read a statement from the provincial police in Punjab, of which Lahore is the capital.

The statement said the attackers were armed with petrol bombs and had stolen a tanker truck carrying 50,000 litres of petrol.

A senior police officer and two paramilitary staff were among the six being held by supporters of TLP, Lahore police spokesman Arif Rana told Reuters news agency.

Paramilitary soldiers stand guard on a road during a protest by supporters of the banned Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) group in Lahore, Pakistan April 18, 2021 [Reuters] Police said they have launched a security operation against the group in response to the attack.

Pakistani news channels have been barred from providing coverage of the group since it was banned, and on Sunday mobile and internet services were down in the area where clashes were taking place.

Addressing the media in the capital, Islamabad, Interior Minister Sheikh Rasheed said the situation in Lahore was “tense”, with an operation centring on the Yateem Khana intersection, about a kilometre (0.6 miles) from a TLP regional headquarters building.

Supporters of the TLP have been sharing videos on social media of what they said were clashes on Sunday with police, and hashtags supporting the group were trending in Pakistan on Sunday.

The videos, which Reuters could not independently verify, showed thousands of protesters clashing with police in riot gear, as clouds of tear gas hung in the air and the crackle of gunfire could be heard.

TLP spokesman Shafiq Amini told Reuters four supporters had been killed on Sunday and several others were wounded in the violence.

Continuing violence

At least four people have been killed, hundreds injured and thousands arrested in the days since Rizvi’s arrest.

The TLP leader had called on the government to honour what he said was a commitment it made in February to his party to expel the French envoy over the publication in France of depictions of Islam’s prophet.

The government said that it only committed to discussing the matter in Parliament.

Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday said the group had been banned because it “challenged the writ of the state”.

“Our government only took action action against TLP under our anti-terrorist law when they challenged the writ of the state and used street violence and attacking the public and law enforcers,” he posted on Twitter.

Let me make clear to people here & abroad: Our govt only took action against TLP under our anti-terrorist law when they challenged the writ of the state and used street violence & attacking the public & law enforcers. No one can be above the law and the Constitution. — Imran Khan (@ImranKhanPTI) April 17, 2021

Last week France advised its citizens to temporarily leave Pakistan.

Formed in 2017 by firebrand Muslim leader Khadim Hussain Rizvi, the TLP advocates for all those deemed to have committed blasphemy against Islam to be killed.

Since 1990, at least 78 people have been killed in mob violence and targeted attacks related to blasphemy accusations in Pakistan, according to an Al Jazeera tally.

The TLP has been banned under anti-terrorism legislation, with the government also initiating a process that would see it delisted as a political party by the country’s Election Commission.

0,German prosecutors said Friday they are investigating a Russian man suspected of helping to plan the murder of a Chechen dissident living in Germany on orders of the Chechen regime,https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210416-germany-probes-russian-over-plot-to-murder-chechen-dissident,"Advertising Read more

Berlin (AFP)

German prosecutors said Friday they are investigating a Russian man suspected of helping to plan the murder of a Chechen dissident living in Germany on orders of the Chechen regime.

The probe comes at a time of increasing tensions between Germany and Russia over Ukraine, the poisoning and imprisonment of opposition leader Alexei Navalny and the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline.

French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were also holding talks Friday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a show of support for his pro-Western government after a Russian military build-up on its eastern borders raised fears of an invasion.

German prosecutors named the suspect as Valid D., accusing him of ""making a declaration of readiness to commit murder, preparing a serious act of violence endangering the state and violating the weapons act"".

He was arrested in January and is in pre-trial detention.

According to German media reports, the target was Mokhmad Abdurakhmanov, the brother of exiled Chechen blogger Tumso Abdurakhmanov, who lives in Sweden.

In February 2020, Tumso Abdurakhmanov was struck in the head with a hammer while he was sleeping in his apartment in the Swedish city of Gavle.

A Swedish court in January convicted a Russian citizen of attempted murder.

After the attack, Tumso Abdurakhmanov posted a video showing the assailant, whom he had apparently overpowered, covered in blood. He also brandished the hammer that he said the assailant used to attack him.

Tumso Abdurakhmanov's YouTube channel is critical of Chechen strongman leader Ramzan Kadyrov and has around 318,000 subscribers.

- Shooting exercises -

According to Der Spiegel news magazine, the attack on Mokhmad Abdurakhmanov was planned in Bavaria in December.

In the run-up to the killing, those involved had carried out shooting exercises in the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, it said.

Valid D. is alleged to have been instructed to bring the murder weapon and the contract killer to Germany, spy on the intended victim and act as a driver during the assassination.

He had managed to smuggle the intended hitman into Germany and obtain a firearm with a silencer, prosecutors said.

According to Der Spiegel, a second suspect in the investigation has testified that the Chechen government offered him 500,000 euros to commit a murder in Germany.

The man claims to have accepted the offer only as a pretence and investigators believe him, it reported.

- Sharpened tone -

Merkel has always stressed the importance of keeping dialogue open with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but she has sharpened her tone in recent months.

The West has accused the Russian government of poisoning Navalny with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok last August, which the Kremlin denies.

Navalny was treated in Berlin before he returned to Moscow in January, where he was imprisoned in a penal colony. His supporters have since become increasingly concerned for his health.

Russia has for years drawn the ire of Western powers, from annexing Ukraine's Crimea to meddling in elections and backing President Bashar al-Assad's government in Syria.

Merkel last year also revealed that she was the target of ""outrageous"" hacking attempts by Russia.

Another Russian man went on trial in Germany in October over the murder of a former commander in Chechnya in a Berlin park, allegedly on Moscow's orders.

The 55-year-old named by prosecutors as Vadim Krasikov, alias Vadim Sokolov, stands accused of gunning down Georgian national 40-year-old Tornike Kavtarashvili, in Kleiner Tiergarten park on August 23, 2019.

A former Chechen separatist turned ardent Kremlin loyalist, Kadyrov, 44, is one of Russia's most powerful men.

Сritics accuse him of creating a fiefdom built on widespread rights abuses and amassing vast personal wealth.

Calling himself President Vladimir Putin's loyal ""foot soldier"", Kadyrov has branded members of the Russian opposition ""jackals"" and ""enemies of the people"".

0,"A Category 5 Super Typhoon Surigae now peaks at 190 mph and 888 mbar, becoming the most intense April tropical cyclone on record, heading further northwest across the Philippine Sea",https://www.severe-weather.eu/tropical-weather/record-super-typhoon-surigae-tropical-cyclone-philippines-mk/,"Who would have expected the very first Western Pacific typhoon of 2021 to take so explosive intensification rate that has brought it to a record Category 5 tropical cyclone? The peak intensify has reached an outstanding 190 mph with the central pressure bottomed at 888 mbar. Only the most violent systems push the eye pressure so low. Super Typhoon Surigae has also become the most intense tropical cyclone for the month of April, surpassing the typhoon Maysak from 2015. Surigae track will thankfully miss the Philippines.

According to the official analysis by the JTWC, Super Typhoon Surigae has peaked as a Category 5 tropical cyclone, packing a remarkable intensity of 190 mph sustained winds (165 knots). Its central pressure has pushed to 888 mbar, which is incredibly low for any tropical system worldwide.

Surigae has explosively intensified from a 90 mph Category 1 typhoon to a monster 190 mph Category 5 storm within a period of only 36 hours from Friday through Saturday! This is even more than double the rate for rapid intensification of a tropical cyclone. The peak intensity has been set just shortly before the Eyewall Replacement Cycle (EWRC) started.

These data are based on satellite observation, as aircraft do not fly into West Pacific typhoons the way NOAA Hurricane Hunters do in the Atlantic, So we, unfortunately, will never know exactly how intense Super Typhoon Surigae actually is. We shouldn’t be surprised that the 190 mph intensity this Saturday might even be an underestimate.

Super Typhoon Surigae has therefore become the most intense typhoon on record for the month of April. And also becomes the first Northern Hemisphere tropical cyclone to reach sub-900 millibar intensity prior to May 1st. Breaking the previous record set by Typhoon Maysak in 2015. Attached below is the exceptional view of the eyewall of Maysak, known as the stadium effect.

Super Typhoon Surigae (known as Bising in the Philippines) literally exploded in intensity from a Category 1 storm on Friday to a beastly Category 5 monster on Saturday, with maximum sustained winds estimated at 190 mph with higher gusts.

Like we are almost used to see over the recent years, Surigae is just the latest tropical cyclone out of many that underwent a process known as rapid intensification, a process that leads to a very significant increase in winds and an extremely deep central pressure of tropical (or also non-tropical) systems. Warming seas are likely the cause for this, according to scientific researches.

Based on the latest model guidance, the northern portions of the Philippines are likely to spare the worst impact of this monster Super Typhoon. The model tracks hint at the Surigae to recurve out to the sea further north, so chances of it to directly hit the northern parts of Luzon are much lower now. Still, heavy rains with flooding potential and severe winds are possible.

Surigae is the first Category 5 tropical cyclone (of any category that includes hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones) to occur in 2021. A typical year brings about 18 tropical systems that reach a Category 4 or 5 around the world.

The driver behind these explosive tropical cyclone formations is very often the very warm sea waters and the wave known as a Madden-Jullian Oscillation (MJO). The combination of both has also lead to a formation of a strong tropical cyclone Seroja that struck Western Australia, just a week before typhoon Surigae formed. Seroja formed after a spectacular Fujiwhara effect of a merging system with a tropical cyclone Odette.

Typically over a normal year, about 8-9 tropical cyclone formations threaten the land of the Philippines. This is the highest number of tropical systems that strike any country around the world.

Typhoon Surigae remains an extremely dangerous system although its center is now forecast to miss the Philippines, it will still travel just a few hundred miles/kilometers to the east of the northern parts of the country. It may still affect the north-northeast Philippines (Luzon) with a huge amount of rainfall and severe winds and dangerous storm surge.

SURIGAE AS A RESULT OF VERY WARM PACIFIC OCEAN AND A MAJOR MJO WAVE

The sea surface temperatures of the western Pacific are very warm this spring, even extremely warm with hot conditions further west towards the Indian Sea. Temperatures are reaching up to about 30 °C (86 °F). Hot seas with temperatures even above 31 °C (87 °F) are being observed over the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea.

Such oceanic conditions are strongly supportive of an explosive intensification for any tropical cyclone. This is also the main reason why Surigae has literally exploded into a powerful Category 5 typhoon this weekend and reached a remarkable maximum sustained winds speed of 190 mph (165 knots).

The waters of the Philippine Sea remain warmer than the long-term average, about 1 °C above normal. Strongly anomalous sea temperature often leads to the explosive development of deep storms, that develop very well-organized tropical cyclones. And often undergoing a very rapid to even explosive intensification as we have seen with Surigae.

As it can be seen from the attached sea temperature anomaly chart, most of the western Pacific is well above average. Also further west across the Indian Sea. The highest temperature anomalies are observed around Japan and across the Northwest Pacific.

Notice also how cold waters are present over the Bering Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk, which is partially frozen. There, frigid Arctic conditions are still in place, as winter hasn’t left the areas that far north through early/mid-April this year.

Another factor that has recently significantly increased the potential for tropical cyclone developments over the western Pacific is the so-called MJO wave. The wave has well coincided with the above normal sea temperatures over the western Pacific. The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is the largest and most dominant source of short-term tropical variability. An eastward-moving wave of thunderstorms circles the entire planet on the equator in about 30 to 60 days.

The MJO has two parts, one side is the enhanced rainfall (wet phase) and the other side is the suppressed rainfall (dry phase). This means that there are increased storms with a lot of rainfall on one side and reduced storms potential and drier weather on the other side. The wet phase leads to diverging (ascending) air parcels while the dry phase brings converging (descending) air parcels. This horizontal movement of the air is referred to as the Velocity Potential (VP) in the tropics.

With the model data, we can easily track the entire MJO wave movement by looking at the larger scale air parcels movement. And can easily see the areas where the air is rising and where it is subsiding.

The graphics below, provided by Michael J. Ventrice, Ph.D. represent an MJO wave with filtered VP200* anomalies (see details below) for the current state, for the week 1 forecast, and for the week 2 forecast.

Cold colors are representative of a more favorable state over the Pacific Ocean for tropical cyclogenesis while warm colors represent a less favorable state for tropical cyclogenesis (e.g. over Africa and South Atlantic).

*VP200 – means a Velocity Potential (VP). It is an indicator of the large-scale divergent flow, so at upper levels in the tropics. The negative VP anomalies (shaded blue in the diagram) are closely tied to the divergent outflow from enhanced convective regions.

Notice how strong and deep the MJO wave is over the western Pacific. This is normally a *very* significant signal of the upward motion, supporting vigorous convection in the region where Super Typhoon Surigae formed.

But there is even more. Another important factor for the development and especially the intensification rate of the tropical cyclone is the Ocean Heat Content (OHC). The OHC takes into account the depth of the sea, and how warm the water layers are deeper below the sea surface.

The attached chart for the region of the western Pacific has recently hinted at a large pool of very high available oceanic heat energy. With a very warm water layer running down quite deep over the Philippine Sea. Taking a closer look, one can see how Surigae has been moving right across these very favorable conditions this weekend. No wonder why it has been so explosively organizing.

The deep waters are also quite warm which typically provides a very favorable environment of a thick layer of warm water. Tropical systems are fueled by these warm layers, as deep convective storms draw energy from hot water. So simplified this means that the thicker the warm layers are, the more fuel/energy is there available to feed the (tropical) storms.

SUPER TYPHOON SURIGAE WILL LIKELY SAVE PHILIPPINES FROM THE WORST

The initial intensity of the Super Typhoon Surigae has been set at 190 mph (165 knots), based on a consensus of multiple agency Dvorak Final T- number estimates ranging from T7.5 to T8.0 (165 – 170 knots). Therefore reflecting an extremely intense tropical cyclone.

The environmental analysis indicates a favorable environment with robust radial outflow, low 10-15 knots vertical wind shear, and very warm (near 30 °C) sea surface temperatures across the Philippine Sea.

Based on the advanced Dvorak estimation, the initial intensity is set at 165-170 knots, a violent and a powerful Category 5 tropical cyclone. The environmental analysis reveals impressive upper-level outflow ventilation, with well-defined gravity waves as well (see the infrared image at the beginning of the article). Attached above are the microwave and infrared satellite images during the peak intensity on Saturday.

The wind field of Surigae is very big. Its hurricane-force winds are spread across the radius of 50-70 miles, while tropical-storm-force winds are reaching out to 105 miles around the dead center of the typhoon. Notice how the gale-force winds (34 knots) are brushing the eastern Philippines, about 200 miles away from the center.

What is probably the most impressive to see is the intensification rate chart on the left, it indicates the increase in winds/intensity from its birth 4.5 days ago. The intensification was gradual and quite rapid until late Friday (local time) until it reached 80 knots and a Category 2 strength. Then becoming explosive for about 24 hours, reaching 165-170 knots and a monster Category 5 strength.

Super Typhoon Surigae will continue as a very violent system through Sunday, maintaining its Category 5 strength or maybe a high-end Category 4 intensity for another 12-36 hours. Surigae has become a very violent tropical cyclone and it will continue gradually moving northwest over the next couple of days. The wind gusts swath map below hints at an intense winds Surigae has developed – more than 250 km/h even forecast by the weather model.

The latest model guidance charts hint that the recurve more northerly than westerly will likely spare the northeastern portions of Luzon from the worst impact. Some weather forecast models are, however, still forecasting the storm could also get extremely close to Luzon coast by Tuesday, but the majority of the models keep the future track farther offshore with much less dangerous impact to the Philippines land.

Attached below is the rainfall total map over the next 5 days, based on the ECMWF model. A huge amount of rainfall (600-800 mm) is underway around the core of the typhoon, but the recent model data suggest the worst part could miss the northern Luzon island, as it stays off to the east. If eventually, a more westerly shift occurs, life-threatening flooding potential could develop. We can see 500-800 mm of rain will be possible.

Once Super Typhoon Surigae begins losing its strength and moves away from the Philippines, much less favorable oceanic conditions for fueling the tropical cyclone will exist. However, conditions should be very closely monitored if Surigae could threaten Japan island Iwo To or even Japan mainland later next week. Stay tuned for further updates!

The three members of the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahvaz (ASMLA) were arrested in February last year and have been in custody since.

""This is a very serious case where persons in Denmark have carried out illegal intelligence activities and financed and promoted terrorism from Denmark in other countries,"" public prosecutor Lise-Lotte Nilas said in a statement.

The trial will start on April 29 and will be held in the Roskilde district court. The defendants face prison sentences of up to 12 years.

In a related case, a Norwegian of Iranian heritage was sentenced to seven years in June last year for spying for an Iranian intelligence service and plotting to assassinate one of the ASMLA-members. That verdict has been appealed.

0,"India is running out of oxygen, Covid-19 patients are dying – because the government wasted time: India took 8 months to invite tenders for new oxygen units. Most aren’t running yet",https://scroll.in/article/992537/india-is-running-out-of-oxygen-covid-19-patients-are-dying-because-the-government-wasted-time,"Vinay Srivastava’s oxygen saturation level was dangerously low when he tweeted around 8 pm on April 16 to say that no hospital in Lucknow was responding to his phone calls.

Oxygen saturation in the blood below the level of 94 is considered a matter of concern for people suffering from Covid-19. Srivastava said his level was 52.

As the 65-year-old freelance journalist’s complaint went viral on Twitter, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister’s media advisor responded to him next afternoon, asking for more details. By then, Srivastava’s oxygen levels had fallen to 31.

At 4.20 pm on Saturday, his son, Harshit Srivastava, tweeted to say his father had died – waiting for an ambulance. “We did not get anything,” he told Scroll.in on the phone. “I called every number for an oxygen cylinder but no one picked up.”

About 7 km from their home, the government-run Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Civil Hospital has been waiting for an oxygen generation plant. It is one of 150 district hospitals across India for which the Central government floated tenders in October, eight months into the coronavirus pandemic, to create units that can produce medical oxygen on site.

But six months later, the oxygen plant is yet to be installed. Had it been in place, breathless Lucknow residents like Srivastava would have stood a better chance of surviving Covid-19. The city of three million people currently has 44,485 confirmed coronavirus cases.

“My father could have been saved,” said Harshit Shrivastava, who was still awaiting his father’s Covid-19 report, hours after his death. “It is entirely the government’s fault.”

About 1,200 km away, in Navsari, Gujarat, another district hospital due to get an oxygen generation plant has had to refuse admission in the last few days to several Covid-19 patients who required oxygen.

“There is a full shortage of oxygen,” said Avnish Dube, the chief medical officer of the district’s 175-bedded MGG General Hospital. Last week, five Covid-19 patients died in a private hospital reportedly due to lack of oxygen – despite the district’s official case load being barely over 500.

Had the oxygen plant been in place, Navsari could have even catered to patients from Surat, one of the worst affected cities in Gujarat, less than an hour away. But, currently, when nearby hospitals contact him, Dube said, “I have had to tell them, ‘Don’t send them here.’”

Eight months to float tenders worth Rs 200 crore

India declared the coronavirus pandemic to be a “disaster” on March 14, 2020. Ten days later, over a billion people were put under the world’s most severe lockdown, with the government arguing it needed time to expand the country’s healthcare capacity.

Early in the pandemic, it became clear that oxygen would be one of the most precious commodities in the battle against the virus. Yet, it took the Narendra Modi government eight months to invite bids for new oxygen generation plants.

On October 21, the Central Medical Services Society, an autonomous institution under the Union health ministry, floated a tender online calling for bidders to establish Pressure Swing Adsorption oxygen plants in 150 district hospitals across the country. The PSA technology separates gases from a mixture in the atmosphere to generate concentrated oxygen that can be supplied to hospital beds through a pipeline, negating the need for hospitals to buy pressurised liquid oxygen from other sources.

It seems unlikely that the delay in kickstarting the tender process was caused by a lack of funds: the outlay for 162 oxygen plants (12 plants seem to have been added later) is just Rs 201.58 crore. The money has been allocated from the PM-Cares corpus – the Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations fund, which had received over Rs 3,000 crore in donations within four days after it was set up on March 27, 2020.

Now, with a deadly second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic sweeping through the country, the Modi government said in a statement on Thursday that another 100 oxygen plants will be established out of the PM-Cares fund. On the status of 162 oxygen plants for which contracts were given in 2020, all it said was that they were “being closely reviewed for early completion of 100 percent of the plants”.

Questions sent to the Central Medical Services Society and the Union health ministry enquiring about the status of the 162 oxygen plants, went unanswered at the time of publication.

But an independent investigation by Scroll.in revealed a disturbing picture of mounting delays. We called more than 60 hospitals across 14 states where the new oxygen plants are expected to come up. Only 11 units had been installed and just five were operational, as per interviews with hospital officials.

Update: Two hours after this article was published, the health ministry put out a series of tweets, confirming that most new oxygen plants were not functional. “Out of 162 PSA Oxygen plants, 33 have been installed,” it said. “By end of April, 2021, 59 will be installed. By end of May, 2021, 80 will be installed.” It is likely the ministry meant a total of 80 plants will be installed by end of May – less than half the number of new sanctioned plants – because the numbers would otherwise add up to 172 plants.

With nearly two million people currently infected with coronavirus in India, oxygen is running out, despite many states redirecting all industrial oxygen production to medical purposes. The government said on Thursday it would import 50,000 metric tonnes of medical oxygen.

The new oxygen plants would have added a capacity of over 4,500 metric tonnes of oxygen per month. This would still have proven inadequate to meet the demand currently seen in the second wave but every additional capacity could have saved lives.

“Even if Covid-19 had not been there, these plants should be there,” said T Sundararaman, former director of the National Health Systems Resource Centre, an advisory body of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

Public health experts like him have argued that the pandemic is an opportunity for India to fill the glaring gaps in its healthcare systems, one of them being the absence of piped oxygen in district hospitals that cater to lakhs of people.

“We have had tragedy after tragedy because of lack of oxygen,” Sundararaman said. This includes deaths due to snake bites, encephalitis, road accidents, among other causes.

Hundreds of thousands of such deaths could have been avoided had piped oxygen been available through on-site generation plants, which as the recent bids have showed, come at a small cost – just Rs 200 crore for over 150 hospitals.

But now Covid-19 is adding to this death roll.

Mounting delays as hospitals and companies trade charges

What explains the delay in installing the oxygen plants when infrastructure should have been ramped up on war footing during a pandemic?

Scroll.in spoke to hospital officials in 14 states – Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and West Bengal. Most officials blamed the companies that had won the contracts for the delays.

In the tender document for the new oxygen plants, district hospitals were listed along with the total number of beds in the hospital and the capacity of the plant. Out of these, Uttar Pradesh was allotted the highest number of plants with varying capacities in 14 districts. It was followed by Maharashtra, which was allotted plants in 10 districts. Delhi was allotted eight plants with a total capacity of generating 7,700 litres of oxygen per minute.

The contracts were awarded to at least three companies – Uttam Air Products, Airox Technologies and Absstem Technologies – according to the information provided by district officials at the hospitals Scroll.in contacted.

In Uttar Pradesh, not one of the 14 hospitals reported having a functional oxygen plant.

SR Singh of Lucknow’s Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Civil Hospital accused the company that won the contract of “fleeing after installing the plant”.

“They have done nothing after that,” he said. “We will now connect pipes and make it operational on our own.”

Gyanendra Kumar of Meerut’s LLRM Medical College said: “We allocated a site for the plant, but the machine is yet to come. I have phoned the company several times, but there is no response.”

In both cases, the contract had been won by Absstem Technologies, a company registered in Delhi. Even MGG general hospital in Navsari, Gujarat, identified Absstem as the company that won the contract but failed to show up. “We keep calling them, they keep saying they would call back,” said Avnish Dube, the chief medical officer of the hospital. “I don’t know what the problem is.”

Scroll.in was unable to contact any official of Absstem since phone numbers and email addresses mentioned on the company website were unresponsive. This article will be updated if the company responds.

Another company that bagged orders to install the new oxygen plants is the Aurangabad-based Airox Technologies. Its founder Sanjay Jaiswal claimed the company had finished all procedures on its end. But the new units were delayed because hospitals, he claims, were yet to provide the infrastructure needed to connect the generation units to the beds.

“From our side, our 60 engineers were aggressive, it is almost done,” he said. “But states need to provide us all copper pipeline connection and electricity. That is not in our hand. Unless they give us that, we cannot start the system.”

Across the states, however, most hospitals insisted they had all the infrastructure ready. “On January 13, I sent the company a mail saying the site is ready,” said Dr Niyati Lakhani of GMERS Medical College and General Hospital, Gandhinagar. “I have not heard back despite several follow-ups. We desperately need it up and running. We just are not being able to manage with cylinders.”

The company contracted to carry out work in Gandhinagar was Delhi-based Uttam Air Products, which Scroll.in found had been blacklisted by the Central Medical Services Society on April 13. A letter by Central Medical Services Society, reviewed by Scroll.in, states the company had not submitted its security deposit or accepted letters of acceptance after winning the contract.

When we broke that news to Lakhani, she said in resignation: “If Uttam is blacklisted then where should I get oxygen from?”

The company’s founder Manish Kapoor declined to comment on the matter. “You already have the letter from CMSS,” Kapoor said. “I think they will be the better people to answer that. We are vendors and we have assisted them in various technical inputs related to those tenders.”

As the delays escalate, smaller hospitals in fur-flung areas are particularly impacted. It is extremely difficult for them to procure oxygen cylinders when supply lines are choked. They are simply unable to compete with bigger players with deeper pockets. These hospitals would have been better equipped to care for severely-ill patients had a local source of production been up and running.

As Ungender, the medical superintendent of the Area Hospital in Telangana’s Bhadrachalam, a district that is home to a large Adivasi population, put it: “When we are purchasing oxygen from outside, we are running huge bills. But if we produce at site, it will reduce our burden.”

After all, as Ungender said, all it took to produce oxygen, once a plant was functional, was air.

Shortages lead to death spiral

Doctors across India say the second wave might prove more lethal, not because new variants of the virus were causing more severe disease (there is no clear evidence on this yet), but simply because a higher case-load would make it harder for patients to get admission to hospital. And even those admitted to hospitals might have to go without oxygen.

The lack of medical oxygen, said doctors in Gujarat, had forcing them into a “triage-like situation” – by which they meant they had to pick between patients, all of whom required oxygen, but only some could be given it.

“Last time we were able to meet the requirements,” said Dr Roopam Gupta of CU Shah Medical College and Hospital in Surendranagar district in Gujarat, “but this year the wave has come so suddenly with a steep rise so at the moment we are only making our ends meet.”

The hospital has 700 beds out of which nearly 200 were occupied on Friday by Covid-19 patients and almost all of them needed oxygen, Gupta said. The hospital has kept two trolleys with 100 oxygen cylinders on standby along with fire engineers manning the vicinity. “It [oxygen] is in such high flow that we are afraid that a disaster [could] take place,” he said.

This time around, doctors were using a new treatment termed high flow nasal therapy, which requires higher amounts of oxygen per patient. “The problem is once a patient goes on high flow then a single patient requires 130 litres per minute of oxygen, so it sucks out the capacity,” Gupta explained. “Even if one patient requires high flow, we have to balance the benefits with 50 others who are surviving on oxygen at 16 litres per minute.”

Many doctors at the district hospitals which are waiting for the new oxygen plants conceded they had stopped following up with the companies because for a while it seemed the worst was over. After reaching a daily-high of about 10 lakh cases in September, Covid-19 cases in India had been falling steadily till February.

“We became a little less serious,” said Sanghamitra K Phule, civil surgeon at Ratnagiri district hospital in Maharashtra. “But now in April, things have become even more serious.”

The oxygen plant at the hospital is now its final stages of installation – a result of soaring demand. “Our requirement has increased by four times,” said Phule. “So even if the plant is not enough by itself to meet our demand, something is better than nothing.”

Running on empty cylinders

While oxygen generation plants are not adequate to serve the needs of bigger hospitals with a higher number of critical patients, they could be a useful tool in the armoury in times of high demand, said doctors. This is especially the case when there is an acute shortage of commercial oxygen across the country.

Ten manufacturers and oxygen cylinder suppliers in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh told Scroll.in that the demand was much higher in the second wave than it had been during the first wave of Covid-19 cases last year.

“Medical oxygen is in shortage,” said Sunil Gupta who runs Raigad Carbides, an oxygen manufacturing firm that has buyers in western India. Before the pandemic, Gupta’s firm would supply oxygen mostly to industries. But now the entire production was being diverted for medical use, he said.

Subasish Guha Roy of Universal Air Products said his firm, which supplies 60 metric tonne oxygen within Karnataka to cities like Bengaluru and Mysore, was running at its full capacity. “It will be difficult to meet daily needs if a high demand continues,” he said.

Even cylinder suppliers said their stocks had run out quickly. “In the last 15 days the demand was three times what it usually is,” said Chirag Vasani of Laxmi Gas Suppliers in Surat, Gujarat. Vasani has been supplying at least 200 cylinders daily within Surat. “This is only because of coronavirus,” he said.

A medical oxygen cylinder supplier in Lucknow did not respond to calls when Scroll.in contacted him on Thursday. Within a minute, he sent a text message: the cylinders were sold out.

Another supplier in Lucknow, Kaushal Katiyar, said he had lost count of the number of cylinders he had sold over the past week. “If there is a patient in every house then you can just imagine what the demand is like,” he said. “I have stopped picking calls.”",2741,16497,31,181

The French National Assembly on Saturday approved the creation of an ""ecocide"" offence as part of a battery of measures aimed at protecting the environment and tackling climate change.

The ecocide measure was passed by 44 votes to 10 in France's lower house of parliament and will, if it becomes law, apply to ""the most serious cases of environmental damage at national level"", said Environment Minister Barbara Pompili.

Transgressors will be liable to up to 10 years in prison and a fine of 4.5 million euros ($5.4 million).

Pompili stressed that the draft bill is aimed at national events, such as the pollution of a French river.

""When we think of the attacks on the Amazon rainforest, that is not something we can tackle within our own laws,"" she said.

The aim is to strengthen the sanctions available to deal with ""serious and durable"" cases of intentional pollution of water, air or soil.

Some right-wing MPs complained about moves towards ""punitive ecology. Julien Aubert of the Republicans voiced the ""serious concerns"" of companies facing ""legal insecurity"" created by such environmental justice measures.

MPs on the left judged the offence being debated insufficient to tackle the problem, highlighting that it will only apply in cases of intentional pollution and not to problems caused by negligence or recklessness.

Some opposition members complained that the very term ""ecocide"" was an ""abuse of language"", preferring a more straightforward offence of ""attacking the environment"".

The Assembly also gave the green light to an offence of endangering the environment, on the model of endangering life, punishable by three years in prison and a 300,000 euro fine. The amount of a whole series of fines provided for by articles of the Environmental Code may also go up to 100,000 euros.

The entire draft bill will go to the Assembly for a vote next month before heading to the upper house Senate.

The Office of the National Security Council (ONSC) said that Afghanistan is battling on the frontline of a war against terrorism, and stated that international cooperation to Afghan security forces will continue even after the end of the mission of foreign forces.

Meanwhile, members of ANDSF have said that the Taliban shouldn’t ""miscalculate"" that the withdrawal of foreign forces will help them win the war in Afghanistan.

They said that the all Afghan soldiers serving in the ranks of the ANDSF are ready to defend their country against any hostile move.

A TOLOnews’ reporter on Thursday visited a unit of the Afghan Special Operation Forces in Chahar Asiab district near Kabul where members of the Special Operations Forces reiterated their commitment to defend Afghanistan.

“The Afghan security and defense forces are ready to maintain the security of Afghanistan, we are thankful to the international community,” said Hayatullah Hayat, the acting Minister of Interior.

“We are not less than the neighboring countries, we are ready to serve voluntarily, we will not let anyone cast an evil eye toward our land,” said Sayed Agha Pacha, a member of the Special Operation Forces.

NATO has committed to continue supporting ANDSF until 2024. However it is not clear whether the alliance will continue its cooperation to ANDSF in the wake of President Joe Biden’s decision to withdraw American troops by September.

“We will defend our soil till the lost drop of our blood,” said Shafiullah Hamdard, a member of the Special Operations Forces.

“They have 20 years of war and combat in the battlefields, the majority of them came to get ready for that day when the Americans will leave,” said Shafiullah Hamdard, a commander of the Special Operations Forces.

Currently there are about 300,000 soldiers serving in the ranks of the ANDSF. The expense of these soldiers is estimated at $4 billion annually.

Meanwhile, US Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin said that US troops have accomplished the mission that they were sent to Afghanistan to accomplish.

“And they have much for which to be proud. Their services and their sacrifices, alongside those of our Resolute Support and Afghan partners, make possible the greatly diminished threat to all of our homelands from Al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups,” he said.

US President Joe Biden on Wednesday announced the full withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan, who have stayed in the country for nearly 20 years, an announcement that was accompanied by concerns of plunging the war-ravaged country into a new civil war.

Biden said that it has been 10 years since Osama Bin Laden's death, and it is time to end America's war in the country and to bring US troops home.

“We will begin our withdrawal on May 1,” Biden said, adding that it will not be a “hasty rush to the exit,” and if the Taliban attacks, the US will defend itself and partners with “all the tools at our disposal.”

Announcing a full withdrawal from the country, Biden said, ""We went to Afghanistan because of a horrific attack that happened 20 years ago.""

""That cannot explain why we should remain there in 2021,"" he added.

“Today, the Afghan people police their own streets, they defend their own interest. They elect their own leaders, many of whom are women. They send their children to school. And they own and operate more private enterprises than ever before. There is still too much violence, to be sure. And we know the Taliban still will seek to reverse some of this progress,” said US Defense Secretary Austin.

The Afghan government says that currently the ANDSF are conducting 98 percent of the operations on their own.",637,3854,29,183

The proposals also increase the area of properties eligible for regularization without an on-site inspection, and risk exacerbating land conflicts in Brazil.

Both bills were born from an executive order from President Jair Bolsonaro that expired in May last year.

The backers of the bills say they would facilitate the regularization of the lands of small farmers, but environmental and land issues experts say the main beneficiaries will be land grabbers and large farmers.

Imagine you have invaded a public land in the middle of the Amazon Rainforest, cut the forest down and, after all that, you get the papers that certify you as the rightful owner of that area. According to experts, that’s what’s going to happen with the passage of two bills currently before the Brazilian Congress.

Both proposals have a common root: Executive Order 910, known as MP 910 or MP of Grilagem, from the local term for a land grabber. The executive order was signed in 2019 by far-right President Jair Bolsonaro. As it wasn’t approved on time by Congress, however, the rule expired in May last year. Legislators came up with two new pieces of legislation to replace it: bills 2633 and 510.

The new legislation would apply to so-called federal public forests, areas that belong to the Union and haven’t been designated for any specific purpose yet, such as for conservation units, Indigenous territories or land reform settlements, for instance. According to IPAM, the Amazon Environmental Research Institute, almost 19 million hectares (47 million acres) of land in the Amazon fits this description — an area nearly twice the size of South Korea. Almost 80% of it is already illegally claimed by private owners through the Rural Environmental Registry (CAR), a self-declared land register that anyone can fill out online.

According to Philip Fearnside, an ecologist at the National Institute for Research in Amazonia (INPA), this is the first step toward legalizing land invasions. “These are illegal operators who claim large areas of usually government land and then, by various means, often illegal, they manage to get the title to it. And whether or not they get the title, they subdivide and sell the land to ranchers, migrants or whoever is interested in buying it,” he said. Usually, these lands are deforested to clear pasture for livestock.

Senate bill PL 510, from Senator Irajá Silvestre Filho, is almost as permissive as the executive order it derives from. It would allow the regularization of lands up to 2,500 hectares (6,180 acres) occupied until 2014; under the current law, the cutoff is 2011. To receive the title to the land, there wouldn’t even need to be an on-site inspection; the verification would be made only through satellite imagery. Under the current law, such an exemption of on-the ground inspections only applies to areas smaller than 400 hectares (990 acres).

The other bill, PL 2633, is before the lower house of Congress, known as the Chamber of Deputies. Proposed by Federal Deputy José Silva Soares, better known as Zé Silva, it’s a bit less generous with land invaders. It would maintain the current cutoff time for regularizing occupied land but raise the maximum area for exemption of on-site inspection to properties up to 600 hectares (1,480 acres). “The difference from our project to MP 910 is clear as oil and water. We are giving a new message for ourselves and for the international market that it is not worthy to occupy public land in Brazil, as we are keeping the temporal milestone,” Silva told Mongabay.

Titling

The most contentious parts of the bills, however, concern areas that don’t meet titling requirements. The evaluation is from Brenda Brito, a researcher from Imazon that is among the largest specialists in the Amazonian land situation. Both bills state that properties occupied after a certain cutoff date (2011 for PL 2633, and 2014 for PL 510) may be put up for sale by the government. In Irajá’s proposal, the invader of the area would be given preference to buy the land.

“Why should this land stop being public, if it was illegally occupied?” said Brenda Brito from Imazon, a leading research institute on the Amazon. She said that besides favoring privatization as the means for resolving the status of these areas — rather than conservation units or Indigenous territories, for example — the bills open space to the legalization of areas invaded after the cutoff dates. “We are not talking about lands invaded in the past, but about lands invaded now and in the future. It will force the areas that are being illegally occupied to be put for sale. If it happens, we can say goodbye to public forests,” Brito said.

The easing of rules to legalize invasions of public lands in Brazil isn’t a recent phenomenon. It started in 2005, under the administration of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, deepened under his successor, Michel Temer, in 2017, and has taken a more urgent turn under Bolsonaro. “We have these successive flexibilizations. It’s endless. The end is when we don’t have more forest to be cut,” Brito said.

“It is like drawing a line in the sand,” Fearnside said. “If you are a land grabber it means that you rather grab your land now and wait a few years until the line moves and you can legalize it.”

Land conflicts may increase

Increasing the size of the areas eligible for legalization without an on-site inspection, as proposed in the bills, may trigger new conflicts in a country where land grabbing already drives a litany of crimes. According to the Pastoral Land Commission (CPT), a Catholic Church-affiliated organization, in 2019 Brazil registered 1,833 conflicts in rural areas. That was the highest number since 2010, and resulted in 32 murders.

Imazon’s Brito said doing away with on-the-ground inspections increases the risk that land still under dispute is granted a title. “Remote detection can be used to check many things, but not if the occupation of the land is peaceful,” she said.

Proponents of the bills say it would accelerate the legalization of land to small farmers, since the government doesn’t have enough personnel to visit the areas. “We have to separate the criminal, the land grabber, from the producer [farmer],” Silva said. “The producer will be the great fiscal to preserve the environment.”

The problem, according to Fearnside, is what the legislators consider to be a small farm. He said the current law already allows the exemption of on-site inspections for properties up to 400 hectares. Anyone who owns that much land “is already a small entrepreneur rancher, not a poor family,” Fearnside said. “Obviously, someone who has 2,500 hectares [as proposed by PL 510] is not a small farmer.”

PL 510 is under discussion in the Senate and PL 2633 is before the Chamber of Deputies. Since February, the speakers of both houses have been closely aligned with Bolsonaro, which increases the prospect of the bills being passed. “That completely changes the scenario and these bills can move forward very fast,” Fearnside said.

Senator Irajá didn’t respond to Mongabay’s request for an interview.

0,Ontario Canada - Police have been given sweeping powers as COVID crisis spirals out of control. New measures introduced to enforce stay-at-home orders as hospitals ‘bursting at the seams’.,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/16/ontario-coronavirus-police-powers-covid-canada,"Ontario has announced sweeping new police powers to enforce an extended stay-at-home order, in the latest sign that officials in Canada’s most populous province have lost control of the rapidly spreading coronavirus.

With a record number of new cases, there is growing worry among experts that the already-strained healthcare system is being further pushed to the brink.

“We’re losing the battle between the variants and vaccines,’’ Ontario’s premier, Doug Ford, said on Friday as he announced the new measures. “We’re on our heels. If we dig in, remain steadfast, we can turn this around.”

Police in Ontario will now have the power to stop drivers or pedestrians and ask for their address and reason for being out. Residents could face fines of up to $C750 (US$600) for refusing to comply. Checkpoints will be established on provincial borders with Manitoba and Quebec to stop non-essential travel – but not on the frontier with the US.

The measures prompted an immediate and furious backlash.

“Blanket powers for police to stop vehicles like this bends our constitutional freedoms too far, and will cause a rash of racial profiling,” Michael Bryant of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association said in a statement.

Ford also announced restrictions on playgrounds, camping and outdoor sports.

And although most of the current cases involve frontline and essential workers, the premier made no mention of sick pay – a policy health experts say would help slow the spread of the virus.

The restrictions came as new modeling forecast more than 15,000 new cases a day in Ontario by June if current growth continues – even with vaccinations. If measures are weakened prematurely, the province could see more than 30,000 a day. Ontario announced a record 4,812 new cases on Friday.

The new modeling also projects that as many as 1,800 residents could be in the intensive care unit by the end of May.

“[Our hospitals] are bursting at the seams, we are setting up field hospitals,” Adalsteinn Brown, co-chair of the province’s science table, told reporters. “Our children’s hospitals are admitting adults. This has never happened in Ontario before. It’s never happened in Canada before.”

Ontario estimates it will need more than 4,000 additional nurses in the coming months and has asked all provinces and territories for 620 nurses – especially those with intensive care experience – as soon as possible.

Brown said that while growth over the next two weeks is effectively “baked in”, strong measures, including extending the stay-at-home order, and a ramp-up of vaccinations could help limit how much worse the third wave becomes.",427,2636,29,188
0,Top Ethiopia health official alleges ‘sexual slavery’ in Tigray: Eleven women tell Reuters they had been raped by soldiers as a top Ethiopian official has made a sexual slavery accusation.,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/15/health-official-alleges-sexual-slavery-in-tigray-report,"Eleven women tell Reuters they had been raped by soldiers as a top Ethiopian official has made a sexual slavery accusation.

A young mother was trying to get home with food for her two children when she says soldiers pulled her off a minibus in Ethiopia’s Tigray region, claiming it was overloaded.

It was the beginning of an 11-day ordeal in February, during which she says she was repeatedly raped by 23 soldiers who forced nails, rock and other items into her vagina, and threatened her with a knife.

Doctors showed Reuters news agency the bloodstained stone and two 3 inches (7.6cm) nails they said they had removed from her body.

The woman, 27, is among hundreds who have reported that they were subjected to horrific sexual violence by Ethiopian and allied Eritrean soldiers after fighting broke out in November in the mountainous northern region of Ethiopia, doctors said.

Some women were held captive for extended periods, days or weeks at a time, said Dr Fasika Amdeselassie, the top public health official for the government-appointed interim administration in Tigray.

“Women are being kept in sexual slavery,” Fasika told Reuters. “The perpetrators have to be investigated.”

Reports of rape have been circulating for months. But Fasika’s assertion, based on women’s accounts, marks the first time an Ethiopian official – in this case, a top regional health officer – has made a sexual slavery accusation in connection with the conflict in Tigray.

In addition, eight other doctors at five public hospitals told Reuters that most of the rape victims described their attackers as either Ethiopian government soldiers or Eritrean troops. It was more common for women to report sexual violence by Eritrean soldiers, the doctors said.

The Eritreans have been helping Ethiopia’s central government fight the region’s former ruling party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), in the conflict plaguing the Horn of Africa nation.

Taken together, the descriptions paint the most detailed picture to date of the sexual violence against women in Tigray and the military’s alleged involvement in it.

Most people interviewed for this article declined to be identified. They said they feared reprisals, including possible violence, by soldiers who guard the hospitals and towns.

Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed acknowledged in a speech to parliament on March 23 that “atrocities were being committed by raping women” and promised that the perpetrators would be punished. He did not identify the alleged perpetrators.

He said then for the first time that Eritrean soldiers had entered the conflict in Tigray in support of the Ethiopian government after the TPLF attacked military bases across the region in the early hours of November 4.

Ethiopia’s government had previously denied this, and the Eritrean government still does not acknowledge their troops’ presence. The TPLF was the dominant power in the central government when Eritrea fought a bloody border war with Ethiopia a generation ago.

Neither the Ethiopian nor the Eritrean governments responded to questions from Reuters about specific cases raised by women and their doctors, or about the accusation of sexual slavery.

No charges have been announced by civilian or military prosecutors against any soldiers. However, officials in both countries emphasised that their governments have zero tolerance for sexual violence – a point Abiy’s spokeswoman, Billene Seyoum, said the prime minister reiterated recently in discussions with military leaders.

The alleged sexual violence has drawn international attention.

Billene said the United Nations, the African Union and Ethiopia’s state-appointed human rights commission have been authorised to carry out joint investigations into alleged abuses by all sides in the conflict. That includes the “criminal clique”, she said, referring to the TPLF.

An Ethiopian military spokesman and the head of a government task force on the Tigray crisis did not respond to phone calls and text messages seeking comment. Reuters could not reach military leaders in either country.

Asked about the reports that Eritrean troops have committed rapes in Tigray and are keeping women in sexual slavery, the country’s Information Minister Yemane Gebremeskel accused TPLF activists of “coaching ‘sympathisers’ to create false testimonies”.

“All the fabricated stories – which are alien to our culture and laws – are peddled to cover up the crimes of the TPLF which started the war,” he told Reuters in a written response.

Reuters was unable to reach a TPLF spokesman.

Records of abuse

Fasika, the health official, said at least 829 cases of sexual assault have been reported at the five hospitals since the conflict in Tigray began.

Those cases were likely “the tip of the iceberg”, Fasika said. Rape is underreported in Ethiopia because it carries a huge stigma. Also, most of the region’s health facilities are no longer functioning, and travel between towns remains dangerous, he said.

Most of the women who have come forward are either pregnant or sustained severe physical injury from the rapes, Fasika said.

Reuters interviewed 11 women who said they had been raped by soldiers from Eritrea, Ethiopia or both. Four said they were kidnapped, taken to military camps and gangraped, in some cases alongside other women. The women did not know the camp names but said they were located near Mekelle and the towns of Idaga Hamus, Wukro and Sheraro.

Five other women said they were held in fields or deserted houses for up to six days. And two said they were raped in their own homes.

Reuters could not independently verify their accounts. However, all told similar stories of being beaten and brutalised.

Healthcare providers confirmed that the 11 women’s injuries were consistent with the events they described, and they showed Reuters medical records for three of the women detailing their conditions.

The healthcare providers also shared details of nine other cases of sexual assault, including the ordeals of two 14-year-old girls.

Although Ethiopia’s government declared victory over the TPLF in November, fighting continues in some areas, and medical workers say new rapes are reported at the region’s health facilities every day.

“This is being done to dishonour the women, to break their pride,” said a doctor at Ayder Referral Hospital, in Mekelle, citing the brutality of the attacks and humiliation of victims. “This is not for sexual gratification. The rapes are to punish Tigray.”

‘Tell my story’

The 27-year-old mother said uniformed soldiers from Eritrea pulled her off a minibus on the road from Mekelle to the city of Adigrat on February 6.

They tied her up and marched her through fields to a bush camp, she said. After 11 days of rapes and beatings, she said, the soldiers forced nails, cotton, plastic bags and rock into her vagina and left her alone in the bush.

Villagers found her unconscious and brought her to a nearby hospital.

She said she was still bleeding from severe internal injuries and could not control her urine, walk without a crutch or sit up for long periods. One leg was broken, she said.

She also described a different kind of pain. While in the hospital, she has no way to speak to her four-year-old son and six-year-old daughter because the Eritrean soldiers took her mobile phone. She had left the children with her mother to search for food and never returned. At the time, the family had less than a week’s worth of bread.

“I don’t know anything if they are dead or alive,” she said. “The enemy destroyed my life.”

A 32-year-old mother in Mekelle told Reuters that soldiers removed her from a minibus on the same road at the end of February.

They were dressed in Ethiopian uniforms, she said, but spoke with an Eritrean accent and had traditional facial scarification typical of the neighbouring country.

She said they shot her 12-year-old son dead in front of her, then took her to a camp where she was held with other female captives and repeatedly raped for 10 days.

“Tell my story,” she said. “This is happening to women out there right now. I want this to end with me.”

A 28-year-old house cleaner said soldiers grabbed her from a street in Mekelle on the afternoon of February 10 and took her to a field outside a military base where she was raped by more than 10 men wearing Ethiopian or Eritrean uniforms.

Wiping away tears, she said that during her two-week ordeal, soldiers doused her with alcohol and mocked her as they assaulted her. She escaped when her captors were distracted by gunfire, she said.

Shot for resisting

The government has set up a task force separate from the human rights commission to investigate the reports of sexual violence. Its head, Mebrihit Assefa, said the body includes representatives from the regional health bureau, the attorney general’s office and federal police.

The task force plans to set up five centres where rape survivors can file reports with law enforcement and receive medical and psychosocial support.

“Our prosecutors [and] police officers are there to investigate all crimes committed, including sexual violence,” said Awol Sultan, a spokesman for the attorney general’s office.

He did not respond to questions about the women alleging they were raped during captivity, or whether prosecutors were in touch with either the Eritrean or Ethiopian militaries. The results of the criminal investigations will be made public at an unspecified date, he said.

Abera Nigus, the head of Tigray’s justice bureau, said the legal process was likely to be complicated because most courts are not functioning in Tigray, and many rape victims cannot identify their assailants.

Knowing their rapists are still at large has also discouraged women from seeking help, doctors said.

Many of the women who sought treatment at hospitals had vaginal and anal tears, sexually transmitted diseases and injuries that rendered them incontinent, said the Ayder hospital doctor, an obstetrician-gynaecologist. The doctor shared notes from 11 cases the hospital had treated involving women raped by soldiers.

One woman had been gangraped on three separate occasions, according to the hospital notes.

Another was five months pregnant when she was raped, the notes indicate. Two 14-year-old girls were sexually assaulted in front of their families. One girl had a hand and foot amputated.

""It is time to end America's longest war,” Biden said during a speech at the White House on April 14. ""It is time for American troops to come home.”



Biden said the drawdown of the 2,500 remaining U.S. troops in Afghanistan will start on May 1.



""We’ll not conduct a hasty rush to the exit,"" he said. ""We'll do it responsibly, deliberately, and safely, and we will do it in full coordination with our allies and partners.""



""Our presence in Afghanistan should be focused on the reason we went in the first place: to ensure Afghanistan would not be used as a base from which to attack our homeland again,"" Biden said, declaring: ""We accomplished that objective.""



The president warned the Taliban that he would ""hold them accountable for its commitment not to allow any terrorists to threaten the U.S. or its allies from Afghan soil.""



He also urged regional powers, including Pakistan, India, China, Russia, and Turkey, to play supportive roles in Afghanistan.



Biden pledged continued support for the Afghan government, but not militarily.

""While we will not stay involved in Afghanistan militarily, our diplomatic and humanitarian work will continue,"" he said. ""We will continue to support the government of Afghanistan.""

Biden also promised to continue providing assistance to the 300,000-strong Afghan Army and police force.



The White House said in a separate statement that Biden spoke with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on April 14 and the two expressed continued commitment to a strong bilateral partnership after the departure of U.S. combat troops from Afghanistan.



""Biden emphasized that the United States will continue to support the Afghan people, including through continued development, humanitarian, and security assistance,"" it said.

Ghani wrote on Twitter that he had spoken on the telephone with Biden and he respected the U.S. decision.



Ghani said that ""we will work with our U.S. partners to ensure a smooth transition"" and ""we will continue to work with our US/NATO partners in the ongoing peace efforts.""



Ghani insisted after the phone call with Biden that his forces were ""fully capable"" of controlling the country.



In a statement released shortly after Biden's announcement, NATO said that allies agreed to start the withdrawal of its forces in Afghanistan by May 1.



""Allies have determined that we will start the withdrawal of Resolute Support Mission forces by May 1,"" NATO's 30 allies said.



""We plan to have the withdrawal of all U.S. and Resolute Support Mission forces completed within a few months.""



Earlier on April 14, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with officials at NATO headquarters in Brussels.

“We will work very closely together in the weeks and months ahead on a safe, deliberate and coordinated withdrawal of our forces,” Blinken said in a televised statement at NATO headquarters in Brussels ahead of a video conference with the military alliance's foreign and defense ministers.

There are also some 7,000 non-U.S. troops from mainly NATO countries -- as well as Australia, New Zealand, and Georgia -- in Afghanistan, outnumbering the 2,500 American soldiers, but still relying on U.S. air support, planning, and leadership for their training mission.

""Together, we have achieved the goals that we set out to achieve and now it is time to bring our forces home,"" said Blinken, who was accompanied in the Belgian capital by U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.

Blinken also spoke by phone with Pakistan's army chief on April 14 and discussed the peace process, according to a statement from the media wing of Pakistan's military.

Biden's announcement means a delay by about five months of a U.S. pledge to withdraw by May 1, a deadline agreed with the Taliban under former President Donald Trump.

The militant group on April 14 reiterated its call for the withdrawal of all foreign forces by the date stipulated in the U.S.-Taliban agreement signed in February 2020.



A senior U.S. official who briefed reporters on April 13 about Biden’s decision on the U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan said the withdrawal would begin before May 1 and could be completed well before the September 11 deadline.

The withdrawal will not be subject to further conditions, including security or human rights, the official said.



""The president has judged that a conditions-based approach, which has been the approach of the past two decades, is a recipe for staying in Afghanistan forever,"" according to the official. The United States will instead focus its efforts on supporting the ongoing peace process, the official added.



But the White House said on April 14 that it was not in the Talban’s interest to allow Afghanistan to become a ""pariah state"" or allow Al-Qaeda to take hold, in reference to the Taliban’s brutal rule in the 1990s.



Meanwhile, Russia said Washington's plan to pull out troops from Afghanistan by September could lead to an escalation in the decades-old conflict.

""What is concerning in this context is that the armed conflict in Afghanistan might escalate in the near future, which in turn might undermine efforts to start direct intra-Afghan negotiations,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said in an April 14 statement.

It remains unclear how the move would impact a planned summit scheduled to begin April 24 in Istanbul seeking to revive intra-Afghan peace talks in Doha, Qatar.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid warned: “If the agreement [with the United States] is breached and foreign forces fail to exit the country on the specified date, problems will certainly be compounded and those who failed to comply with the agreement will be held responsible.”

Another Taliban spokesman, Muhammad Naeem, said on April 13 the group would not take part in any summits that would make decisions about Afghanistan until all international troops “completely withdraw from our homeland.”



Meanwhile, CIA Director William Burns warned on April 14 that Washington's ability to collect and act on threats will diminish when the time comes for the U.S. military to withdraw from Afghanistan.

""There is a significant risk once the U.S. military and the coalition militaries withdraw,"" Burns told the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, although he said the United States would retain ""a suite of capabilities.""

The agreement between the Trump administration and the Taliban called for the Taliban to halt attacks and hold peace talks with the Afghan government in exchange for a U.S. commitment to a complete withdrawal by May 2021.



Biden said last month that the withdrawal deadline would be difficult to meet due to logistical challenges, while the Taliban warned of “consequences” if it reneged on the May 1 deadline.

U.S. commanders have said that the Taliban has failed to meet the conditions of the peace agreement by continuing attacks on Afghan security forces and civilians and failing to totally cut ties with Al-Qaeda and other extremist groups.



Biden’s decision comes after a review of the February 2020 agreement and amid a growing consensus in Washington that little more can be achieved in the country.



The United States has tried before to withdraw from Afghanistan, but concerns about Afghan security forces, corruption, and the resiliency of the Taliban have hampered the plans.



A U.S. withdrawal by September 11 would coincide with the 20th anniversary of the terrorist attacks in the United States that killed nearly 3,000 people. After the attacks, the United States led an invasion of Afghanistan that toppled the Taliban regime for harboring Al-Qaeda, the terrorist group behind the 9/11 attacks.

The military rulers of Myanmar have ordered the release of 23,184 prisoners from jails across the country under a New Year amnesty, a Prisons Department spokesman said, though few, if any, democracy activists arrested since a February 1 coup are expected to be among them.

Saturday is the first day of the traditional New Year in Myanmar and the last day of a five-day holiday that is usually celebrated with visits to Buddhist temples and rowdy water throwing and partying in the streets.

Pro-democracy activists called for the cancellation of the festivities this year and instead for people to focus on a campaign to restore democracy after the military’s overthrow of the elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.

On Saturday, thousands of anti-military protesters took to the streets of Mandalay, the country’s largest city, demanding the restoration of democracy, according to images and reports posted on social media.

Despite a downpour, thousands of people also marched in Shan State to denounce the military.

While the military was freeing thousands of prisoners, it was also seeking 832 people on warrants in connection with the protests.

Aung San Suu Kyi is among 3,141 people arrested in connection with the coup, according to a tally by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) activist group.

“These detainees are mostly from before February 1 but there are also some who were imprisoned after,” Prisons Department spokesman Kyaw Tun Oo told Reuters news agency by telephone.

Asked if any of those being freed might have been detained in connection with the protests against military rule, he said he did not have details of the amnesties.

More warrants issued

Among the people the military is seeking to arrest are several internet celebrities, actors and singers who have spoken out against the coup, wanted on the charge of encouraging dissent in the armed forces.

Two of them, the married couple of film director Christina Kyi and actor Zenn Kyi, were detained at the airport in the main city of Yangon on Saturday as they were trying to leave the country, several media outlets reported.

A spokesman for the military government did not answer calls seeking comment.

Zayyar Lwin, Paing Ye Thu, Paing Phyo Min aka Dee Yay of #PeacockGeneration are among the released 23,000+ prisoners today on Myanmar's New Year after they have served prison terms. Welcome back, our friends.

Myanmar has been in crisis since the coup, which the military defended with accusations of fraud in a November election won by Aung San Suu Kyi’s party, though the election commission dismissed the objections.

The now-dismissed government had held power for the first five years of civilian rule since nearly half a century of army rule ended.

People infuriated by the return of military rule have taken to the streets day after day to demand the restoration of democracy, defying crackdowns by the security forces in which 728 people have been killed, according to the AAPP’s latest figures.

Political leaders, including removed members of parliament, announced the formation of a National Unity Government (NUG) on Friday including Aung San Suu Kyi and leaders of the anti-coup protests and ethnic minorities.

The military government has yet to comment on the unity government but has said it will hold a new election within two years and hand power to the winner.

The hugely popular Aung San Suu Kyi faces various charges, including the violation of the Official Secrets Act that could see her jailed for 14 years. Her lawyers dismiss the charges.

Saint Petersburg (AFP)

Russia on Saturday said it would expel a Ukrainian diplomat, prompting an immediate pledge of retaliation from Kiev, further escalating tensions over Moscow's troop build-up on Ukraine's eastern flank.

The detention of a Ukrainian consul in the second city Saint Petersburg comes at a time of global concern of a repeat of Moscow's 2014 aggression, when Russia annexed the peninsula of Crimea and backed separatists in Ukraine's east.

Moscow claimed the Ukrainian diplomat had been caught ""red-handed"" trying to obtain sensitive information.

In response, the Ukrainian foreign ministry protested ""the illegal"" detention of its diplomat and said Kiev would expel a senior Russian diplomat.

Kiev has been battling Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine since 2014 and clashes intensified early this year, effectively shredding a ceasefire agreed last July.

Around 30 Ukrainian troops have been killed since the start of the year, compared to 50 last year. Most of them were victims of sniper fire.

Russia has detained a number of Ukrainian nationals on suspicion of spying in recent years but the arrest of a diplomat is rare.

""A Ukrainian diplomat, a consul of Ukraine's Consulate General in Saint Petersburg, Alexander Sosonyuk, has been detained by Russia's FSB,"" the security service said in a statement, using the Russian language spelling of his name.

He was held on Friday, the security service said. Kiev said the diplomat had spent several hours in detention.

The Russian foreign ministry said Saturday it had summoned Ukraine's charge d'affaires Vasyl Pokotylo and told him that the Ukrainian diplomat had 72 hours to leave the country ""beginning April 19"".

""The Russian side pointed to the inadmissibility of such kind of activity,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement.

Russia's domestic intelligence agency said Sosonyuk had been caught ""red-handed"" during a meeting with a Russian national as he sought to receive ""classified"" information.

""Such activity is not compatible with his diplomatic status and is clearly hostile in nature towards the Russian Federation,"" the FSB said.

""In conformity with international law, measures will be taken against the foreign diplomat.""

- 'Crude violations' -

In Kiev, the Ukrainian foreign ministry said it protested the diplomat's detention and rejected Russia's accusations.

Foreign ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said Russia had ""crudely"" violated diplomatic conventions and sought to escalate tensions.

""In response to the above-mentioned provocation, a senior diplomat of the Russian embassy in Kiev must leave Ukrainian territory within 72 hours beginning April 19,"" Nikolenko told AFP. He did not provide further details.

Faced with the largest deployment of Russian troops on Ukraine's borders since 2014, President Volodymyr Zelensky has requested more help from the West, and Western leaders have urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop intimidating Ukraine.

Tensions between Russia and Ukraine come against the background of a new war of words between Moscow and Washington as new US President Joe Biden seeks a tougher line against Putin.

The US on Thursday announced sanctions and the expulsion of 10 Russian diplomats in retaliation for what the White House says is the Kremlin's US election interference, a massive cyber attack and other hostile activity.

Russia said Friday it would expel US diplomats and sanction US officials in response while recommending the US envoy leave Russia ""for consultations"".

The central European country expelled 18 Russian embassy staff on Saturday over the issue and said investigations had linked Russian intelligence to the explosion, which killed two people.

Russia's Interfax news agency cited Vladimir Dzhabarov, first deputy head of the Russian upper house's international affairs committee, on Saturday as saying Prague's assertions were absurd and Russia's response should be proportionate.

Meanwhile, another high-profile official, Leonid Slutsky, chairman of the State Duma's international affairs committee, said Saturday the grounds for the Czech move “do not stand up to criticism,” adding that the Czech Republic follows “the Russophobic course of the United States” by expelling Russian diplomats, Russian state news agency Tass reported.

The expulsions and allegations come at a time of heightened Russian-Western tensions and have triggered the biggest dispute between the Czechs and Russia since the 1989 end of Communist rule, when Prague was under Moscow's domination for decades.

On Sunday, the E.U.'s executive commission confirmed remarks by acting Czech Foreign Minister Jan Hamacek on Twitter that the dispute would be addressed during a previously schedule E.U. foreign ministers' video conference on Monday.

Separately, Czech police said they were searching for two men in connection with serious criminal activity who were carrying Russian passports in the names of Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, and that the men were in the country in the days leading up to the 2014 explosion.

Those were the aliases used by two Russian military intelligence (GRU) officers who British prosecutors charged with the attempted poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia with the nerve agent Novichok in the English city of Salisbury in 2018.

Moscow has denied involvement in that incident.

The United States and Britain said they stood in full solidarity with the Czech Republic in the dispute with Russia.

A statement by the U.S. Embassy in Prague said on Saturday Washington ""stands with its steadfast ally, the Czech Republic. We appreciate their significant action to impose costs on Russia for its dangerous actions on Czech soil.""

Meanwhile, British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Twitter: ""The U.K. stands in full support of our Czech allies, who have exposed the lengths that the GRU will go to in their attempts to conduct dangerous and malign operations – and highlights a disturbing pattern of behaviour following the attack in Salisbury.""

The Kremlin’s relations with many NATO members, most of whom are in the E.U., as well as the United States are more strained that at any time since the Cold War.

The West has voiced alarm over a large Russian military build-up on Russia's Western borders and in Crimea, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014, following a spike in fighting in eastern Ukraine between Russian-backed separatists and government forces.

The United States imposed sanctions against Russia this week for interfering in last year's U.S. election, cyber hacking, bullying Ukraine and other alleged malign actions, prompting Moscow to retaliate.

Last month U.S. President Joe Biden said he thought his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin was a ""killer"" and Moscow recalled its ambassador to Washington for consultations.",564,3648,32,201

0,Serbs who fought for Moscow-backed militias in the conflict in eastern Ukraine say they are ready to take up arms again as a massive Russian military build-up on the border raises fears of more violence.,https://balkaninsight.com/2021/04/16/as-ukraine-conflict-intensifies-serb-volunteers-prepare-for-battle/,"Bratislav Zivkovic, who describes himself as a Chetnik commander and claims he was one of the first Serb volunteers to go to Crimea when it was annexed by Russia in 2014, also said he believed that the warring sides in eastern Ukraine “are indeed on the edge of renewing their conflict”.

“People here are absolutely against the war, not only in the Luhansk and Donetsk People’s Republics, but also on the other side, especially in the frontier zone. People whose relatives stayed on the Ukrainian side are talking about that,” Zivkovic told BIRN from eastern Ukraine.

Legislation in both Bosnia and Serbia prohibits going to fight abroad, and Zivkovic has previously been investigated in Serbia for taking Serb nationalist Chetnik volunteers to Ukraine. However, the investigation was dropped .

He claimed that there have been troop movements on both sides of the ‘line of contact’ between Ukrainian government-controlled territory and rebel-held areas, and that “shelling has also increased”.

Zivkovic cited allegations that a Ukrainian armed drone killed a five-year-old boy in the separatist-held village of Alexandrovskoye earlier this month. The killing has been denied by the Kyiv government. Zivkovic claimed that after this, “many people have come forward and expressed interest in the situation on the front”.

“There is an increased interest in this region now, not only in Serbia and Republika Srpska, but also in Montenegro, [North] Macedonia and even Bulgaria,” he added.

The trials that have been held so far may not have acted as a deterrent. Of the scores of Serb volunteers who have fought for Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine, few have been severely punished. Serbia has convicted a total of 29 individuals of fighting abroad, but most of them were given suspended sentences after admitting guilt.

According to a report by the Security Ministry of Bosnia and Herzegovina, over the past seven years, 11 Bosnian citizens have taken part in combat activities in Ukraine.

“At present one Bosnian citizen is away in the war zone in Ukraine,” stated the report , which was based on data from the police, intelligence service and other such institutions.

Of the 11 volunteers said to have gone to fight in Ukraine from Bosnia and Herzegovina, only one, a man called Gavrilo Stevic, has been put on trial. However, he was acquitted on appeal last year.

The dean of the Faculty of Criminal Justice, Criminology and Security Studies at the University of Sarajevo, Jasmin Ahic, said that the acquittal, as well as the failure to prosecute the remaining ten volunteers, showed that there was impunity for those who went to fight in Ukraine, while other Bosnians who went to fight for Islamic State in Syria have been jailed.

“This implies a distinction between those who fought in Syria and in Ukraine. This only goes to show that Bosnian citizens are not equal before the law and that there is no justice,” Ahic said.

Stevic’s trial did however show how some volunteers from the Balkans made their way to the conflict zone in eastern Ukraine. They travelled via the Serbian capital Belgrade to Moscow, from where they were transferred to Rostov-on-Don in southern Russia, near the Ukrainian border, then across to separatist-held territory in Donbas.

The indictment alleged that Stevic received help from a Chetnik association called the Ravna Gora Movement, and that Bratislav Zivkovic travelled from Belgrade with him and a group of other volunteers. In Rostov-on-Don, they were met by Russian military volunteers who recruited people to fight in Donetsk and Luhansk, as well as a private company that was looking for guards for a “humanitarian convoy” to eastern Ukraine, the indictment also claimed.

The Bosnian state prosecution told BIRN that it is still working with police and security agencies on several cases of Bosnian citizens going to fight abroad in places including Ukraine, but declined to provide further details for operational reasons.

Matteo Salvini, leader of Italy's right-wing League party, must stand trial on charges of kidnapping over his decision to prevent more than 100migrants from landing in the country in 2019, a judge ordered on Saturday.

Salvini, who was interior minister at that time, left the migrants stranded at sea until prosecutors ordered the seizure of the ship and the evacuation of the people on board.

The trial will begin in the Sicilian capital of Palermo on September 15.

Salvini, who has built much of his political fortune on an anti-immigration campaign, could face up to 15 years in prison if found guilty at the end of a tortuous, three-stage judicial process.

A definitive conviction could bar him from government office.

""I am going to trial with my head held high, in your name as well as mine. Italy first, always,"" Salvini tweeted immediately after the ruling. ""Defending our country is a citizen's sacred duty ... that is what I am being tried for.""

During his 14 months as interior minister, Salvini stopped several boats from docking in Italy in an effort to halt migrant flows, and regularly accused the charities that operated them of effectively encouraging people smuggling.

Proactiva Open Arms, the Spanish NGO which operated the migrant rescue ship at the heart of the case, welcomed the judge's ruling.

""Violating a fundamental right such as the protection of human beings at sea for the sake of political propaganda is shameful,"" said its founder Oscar Camps, adding that the trial would be ""an opportunity to judge a period of European history.""

Salvini withdrew the League from the coalition government in the summer of 2019 in a failed bid to trigger an election when his party was riding high in the polls.

The League, now part of Mario Draghi's two-month-old national unity government, has lost more than 10 points of voter support but remains the most popular party in Italy on about 23%, according to most opinion polls.

“The narrative of the Afghan government falling apart is a false narrative,” Ghani said.

President Ghani said that Afghan commandos, special forces and air force alone are 40,000 and that “they have trained among the best, they are among the best in the region.”

“As long as this force stays, there is no risk of state collapse,” Ghani reiterated.

He said that all these forces have been brought into one command of the Afghanistan National Authority for Special Operations and that they carry 30 to 40 operations every day.

Ghani mentioned that he is ready to hand over power to his elected successor.

“I have four years of my term left but for the sake of peace, my colleagues and I are willing to hold elections from six months to a year, maximum, so that the will of the people – the key to us is the right of the people to choose their leader and for me to hand over legitimate authority to my successor,” he said.

Ghani said that now is the time for the Taliban to choose whether they will opt for peace or for violence.

“It is a moment of choice for Taliban. Will they opt for a peace that is on the table or will they opt for conquest,” Ghani said.

He said that the announcement of the withdrawal of US and NATO forces withdrawal has also created a moment of choice for Pakistan.

“For Pakistan, it is a decision of destiny. Will it opt for regional cooperation, international partnership, and regional prosperity through joint efforts, or will it give way to the forces that have headered to support and sustain the Taliban and the wave of extremism for which Pakistan next to Afghanistan has probably paid the highest price? So, it is a moment of decision. We will need to watch.”

He added that the Afghan government is committed to talks and that it is now up to the Taliban to act.

“The ball is in the court of the Taliban. We are fully prepared for Istanbul. There is a consensus on this, national and within the government. We will see now whether the Taliban opt,” Ghani said. “The key is that the political committee does not represent, unfortunately, the military committee or the commanders. They (Taliban) have not socialized peace yet, but it’s a jolt that they need to absorb because they could not think that the United States will withdraw.”

He said that the Biden administration’s decision to withdraw forces from Afghanistan ""is no surprise"" for him.

Ghani added that the decision “clarifies a lot of things and it allows us to move forward so the right decision will have the consequences of making Taliban think seriously.”

“If they (Taliban) engage in war, they would have lost a golden opportunity and I hope that they don’t do that,” he stated.

Brasília (AFP)

Brazil's full Supreme Court upheld a ruling Thursday annulling former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's corruption convictions, which cleared the way for him to run for a new presidential term next year.

In an 8-3 ruling, the court upheld Justice Edson Fachin's March 8 decision quashing Lula's convictions on procedural grounds, which has upended Brazilian politics as far-right President Jair Bolsonaro gears up to seek reelection.

The ruling does not find Lula innocent. But it essentially puts prosecutors back to square one by sending the cases to another court.

In the meantime, Lula, the popular but tarnished leftist who led Brazil through an economic boom from 2003 to 2010, has emerged as the top contender to unseat Bolsonaro in the October 2022 elections.

Lula's lawyers called the decision ""historic.""

""This is another Supreme Court ruling that reestablishes the credibility of the justice system in our country,"" they said in a statement.

Bolsonaro said the ruling means ""Lula is now a candidate"" for 2022 -- and ominously warned of the consequences.

""Look what Brazil's future is going to be like with the kind of people he'd bring into the presidency,"" he said in his weekly live address on Facebook.

""You can all draw your own conclusions.""

Lula, 75, has not officially declared himself a candidate.

But polls put the steelworker-turned-president neck-and-neck with 66-year-old Bolsonaro, and in some cases ahead.

- Battle lines drawn -

Lula was jailed in 2018 on charges of taking bribes from companies seeking juicy contracts at state oil giant Petrobras.

Prosecutors say he accepted gifts including a triplex beach apartment and renovations at a ranch property in exchange for greasing companies' access to juicy contracts with state oil giant Petrobras.

The cases felled him just as he was gearing up to seek a new presidential term, in elections Bolsonaro ultimately won.

Lula has always maintained he is innocent and that the cases against him were a conspiracy to sideline him politically.

After Fachin's initial ruling annulling his convictions, he came out swinging at Bolsonaro, attacking the president's ""imbecile"" handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed 365,000 lives in Brazil -- the world's second-highest death toll.

""Don't be scared of me. They say I'm a radical because I want to get to the root of this country's problems,"" he said in his comeback press conference, which analysts called a campaign speech in all but name.

- Judge accused of bias -

The charges against Lula grew out of ""Operation Car Wash,"" an investigation that blew the lid off a massive corruption scheme in which top politicians and business executives systematically siphoned billions of dollars from Petrobras.

Fachin ruled the court in the southern state of Parana that handled the Car Wash cases did not have jurisdiction for Lula's charges because they were not directly related to the Petrobras scheme.

He ordered the four cases -- two convictions and two pending judgments -- transferred to another court.

Prosecutors had asked the Supreme Court to at a minimum reinstate the two convictions, arguing they were legally sound and that Lula was ""named as the ringleader"" of the Petrobras scheme -- an accusation they have struggled to pin on him in court.

Lula spent 18 months in jail before being freed in 2019 pending appeal.

The full Supreme Court is also due to rule on prosecutors' appeal of a decision that found the lead Car Wash judge, Sergio Moro, was biased in convicting Lula.

They set deliberations on that case for next Thursday.

Moro controversially accepted the post of justice minister in Bolsonaro's government when the latter won the 2018 election.

That fueled accusations he colluded to sideline Lula and get Bolsonaro elected.

Moro later had a falling-out with Bolsonaro, accusing the president of interfering in federal police investigations. He resigned in April 2020.

0,Berlin rent cap overturned by Germany's top court: Germany's constitutional court has decided that the Berlin rent cap violates Germany's constitution. The cap was one of the most-debated laws in the country,https://www.dw.com/en/berlin-rent-cap-overturned-by-germanys-top-court/a-57209268,"Germany's constitutional court in Karlsruhe has ruled that the Berlin state government had no right to impose a rent cap in the German capital.

The court ruling found that since the federal government had already made a law regulating rents, a state government could not impose its own law that infringed upon that, and said the Berlin rent cap law was therefore null and void.

Today was a ""heavy day for renters in Berlin,"" said Sebastian Scheel, Berlin's minister for urban development and housing, of the socialist Left party. ""We took this path for good reasons,"" he told the taz newspaper. ""We knew that we were treading new ground, and wanted to sound out this issue of jurisdiction.""

He also promised that the government would step in to help tenants who would now potentially be hit by sudden rent hikes. A demonstration calling for major property-owning companies to be expropriated was called on Thursday evening.

The Berlin Tenants' Association called Thursday's ruling a ""slap in the face"" for all tenants. ""To declare the law unconstitutional from the beginning is irresponsible social policy,"" the association's director Reiner Wild said in a statement, before noting that it contradicted several other court rulings.

The constitutional complaint had been brought in May 2020 by Bundestag parliamentarians from the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the pro-business Free Democratic Party (FDP), who both welcomed the decision on Thursday.

Kai Wegner, a spokesman for the CDU federal parliamentary group, called the decision a ""sensitive defeat"" for the Berlin government, who he blamed for making ""a false rent cap promise"" to the city's renters.

""The damage is great,"" he said in a statement. ""Ideology solves no problems, not in the housing market either. In the long-term, only a sufficient supply of housing can secure affordable rents.""

But the Berlin government had called the rent cap a ""breathing space"" for tenants while new housing could be built.

Soaring rents

Berlin's rent cap meant that rents for 90% of Berlin's apartments were frozen for five years at their June 2019 level. New rents could not go above that level, and as of November 2020, any existing rents that were still above that level had to be reduced.

In Berlin tenants had long been protesting gentrification and rent hikes

The Berlin rent cap has been one of the most debated laws in Germany over the past few years.

Campaigners argued it was a vital way to preserve affordable housing in the German capital, where rents have been soaring for years. The German Property Foundation (ZIA) calculated last year that rents in new contracts in the city had risen 27% from 2013 to 2019 alone.

The federal government imposed a ""rent brake"" in 2015, which allowed landlords to raise rents by 10% above the local market level. According to the constitutional court, the existence of this law among others meant that Berlin could not impose its own regulation.

Since the rent cap came into effect on February 23, 2020, it has caused uncertainty in the German capital's housing market, largely because landlords took to putting a ""shadow rent"" — higher rents that tenants would have to pay in case the court found the rent cap unconstitutional — in their rental contracts.

Renters associations have called these shadow rents unlawful.

Thursday's decision could mean a windfall for landlords as rents are instantly raised by hundreds of euros a month, on top of which landlords could now demand their tenants back-pay higher rents for the past year.

International implications

International campaigners saw the Berlin rent cap as one of the most radical rent control measures worldwide, because though other European countries and cities have introduced rent freezes, the Berlin law allowed tenants to actually sue their landlords to reduce their rents.

Barbara Steenbergen, EU liaison head of the International Union of Tenants (IUT), said she was shocked by the German court decision, not least because other state-level in Berlin laws did in fact regulate regulate private property rights: There is a law that bans landlords from keeping property empty as a speculation, for instance.

Steenbergen said that the Berlin state government had been forced to act because the federal government's rent control measures, the rent brake, had not slowed the capital's spiraling rents.

She also expressed some hope for other tenants' campaigns in other countries. ""This decision is not about whether the rent cap is good or bad, it is purely about jurisdiction,"" she told DW. ""So now what legislators in the rest of Europe have to check is: What is actually the jurisdiction that you have – in order to avoid possible mistakes like in Berlin.""

Balakrishnan Rajagopal, UN's special rapporteur on the right to housing, told DW he was concerned that that the ruling could have a negative impact for Berlin and other cities struggling with an affordability crisis: ""The impact of the ruling could be quite severe on renters in Berlin and elsewhere.""

""My main concern is that this particular ruling could affect the ability of the Berlin government, as well as the federal government, to ensure that housing remains affordable.""

There is interest in ""the influence that Germany's record will have on other countries that are also facing similar crises of affordability in other large global cities like Berlin around the world — how will it [the ruling] affect their ability to control the problem of affordability.""

He warned that the position of the court ""shut down"" and ""discouraged"" the efforts by the Berlin government to implement affordable housing. He added: ""that sends a negative message around the world, unfortunately, and that is why I'm quite concerned.""

0,Czech Republic - Czech police hunt two men with names matching Skripal suspects - News follows announcement of expulsion of 18 Russia diplomats identified as spies linked to 2014 blast that killed two people,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/17/czech-police-hunt-two-men-with-names-matching-skripal-suspects,"Czech police have said they are seeking two Russian men in connection with a 2014 blast that killed two people. The men, they said, hold passports used by the suspects in the attempted poisoning of Sergei Skripal.

The names match those used by the two men accused of poisoning Skripal and his daughter Yulia with the Soviet-era nerve agent novichok in the English city of Salisbury in 2018. Russia denied involvement in the poisoning, but about 300 diplomats were sent home in subsequent tit-for-tat expulsions.

“The two men were present on Czech territory in … October 2014,” when the Vrbetice blast occurred, the Czech organised crime squad said on Saturday, adding that they also used Tajik and Moldovan identities.

The Czech government had earlier said it was expelling 18 Russian diplomats identified by local intelligence as secret agents of the Russian SVR and GRU services that are suspected of involvement in a 2014 explosion.

“Eighteen employees of the Russian embassy must leave our republic within 48 hours,” the interim foreign minister, Jan Hamáček, told reporters.

Hamáček said on Twitter on Sunday that he would discuss the matter at an EU foreign ministers’ meeting on Monday.

The prime minister, Andrej Babiš, said Czech authorities had “clear evidence” linking GRU officers to the explosion in an ammunition warehouse in 2014 that left two people dead.

“We have good reason to suspect the involvement of GRU officers from unit 29155 in the explosion at the ammunition warehouse in Vrbetice,” in the east of the country, Babiš said. He added he had received the information on Friday, without explaining why it had taken so long.

“The explosion led to huge material damage and posed a serious threat to the lives of many local people, but above all it killed two of our fellow citizens, fathers of families.”

Hamáček, who is the interior minister as well as serving as interim foreign minister after his predecessor was sacked earlier this week, said he was sorry that the incident would “fundamentally damage Czech-Russian relations”.

“We are in a situation similar to that in Britain following the attempted poisoning in Salisbury in 2018,” he said, referring to the case of Skripal.

Hamáček said he had summoned the Russian ambassador, Alexander Zmeyevsky, on Saturday evening to tell him about the decision.

On Thursday, the Czech Republic’s neighbour Poland said it had expelled three Russian diplomats for “carrying out activities to the detriment” of Poland.

Warsaw also expressed solidarity with the US, which earlier that day had announced sanctions and the expulsion of 10 Russian diplomats in retaliation for what Washington said was the Kremlin’s US election interference, a massive cyber-attack and other hostile activity.

Aden - Mohammed Nasser

A recent study has warned that the coastline of Yemen’s Red Sea and of its neighboring countries is at risk of an environmental disaster that could happen any day if an oil spill from or an explosion takes place at the derelict FSO Safer oil tanker.

“It is increasingly likely that there could be an immense oil leakage from and/or an explosion of the FSO Safer, a floating storage and offloading unit anchored in the Red Sea, 60km north of the port of Hodeidah,” said Riskaware, Catapult Satellite Applications and Acaps in their joint assessment.

Although it is owned by Yemen’s national oil company, FSO Safer fell into the hands of Iran-backed Houthi militias in 2015. Since then, no maintenance work has been carried out on the aging tanker.

Disregarding international warnings against the hazards of poor maintenance at FSO Safer, Houthis continue to block a team of UN experts from repairing the rundown oil vessel.

FSO Safer is currently holding 1.1 million barrels of crude oil that are at a risk of either exploding or spilling into Red Sea waters.

“Up to 5.9 million people in Yemen and 1 million in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) could be exposed to very high air pollution levels, with harmful effects seen 24–48 hours after a fire starting on the Safer,” said study.

In its impact assessment for April-June 2021, the study warned that up to 967,000 internally displaced persons could be covered by a smoke plume if an explosion goes off at Safer.

The fire, according to the study, would likely affect Yemen’s governorates of Hajjah, Hodeidah, Sadah, Dhamar, Sanaa, Al Mahwit, and Raymah.

Saudi Arabia’s southern Jazan city could also be affected, the study added.

“There would be a significant health risk to vulnerable populations (such as adults and children with lung problems and adults with heart problems) and the elderly, with aggravation of pre-existing heart and lung problems likely,” it highlighted.

Pollution from a fire taking place on FSO Safer would create an additional hazard for coronavirus patients with breathing problems.",359,2161,38,216

Samarra (Iraq) (AFP)

Five rockets targeted an Iraqi airbase hosting US soldiers Sunday, wounding two foreign contractors and three Iraqi soldiers, in the latest attack coinciding with tensions between Baghdad's allies Tehran and Washington.

Two of the rockets fired at Balad airbase, north of Baghdad, crashed into a dormitory and a canteen of US company Sallyport, a security source told AFP.

Two foreign contractors and three Iraqi soldiers were wounded, the source added.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the United States routinely blames Iran-linked Iraqi factions for such attacks on its troops and diplomats.

F-16 fighters are stationed at the Balad airbase, and several maintenance companies are present there, employing Iraqi and foreign staff.

There have been around 20 bomb or rocket attacks against American interests, including bases hosting US soldiers, since US President Joe Biden took office in January.

Dozens of others took place from the autumn of 2019 under the administration of Donald Trump.

Two Americans and an Iraqi civilian have been killed in such attacks since late 2019.

An Iraqi civilian working for a firm maintaining US fighter jets for the Iraq airforce was also wounded in one attack.

The Balad base was also targeted earlier this month, without causing any casualties.

The attacks are sometimes claimed by shadowy Shiite armed groups aligned with Iran who are demanding the Biden administration set a pullout date for Iraq as it has for Afghanistan.

On Wednesday, an explosives-packed drone slammed into Iraq's Arbil airport in the first reported use of such a weapon against a base used by US-led coalition troops in the country, officials said.

There were no casualties in the strike on the capital of northern Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region, although it did cause damage to a building in the military part of the airport.

In February, more than a dozen rockets targeted the military complex inside the same airport, killing an Iraqi civilian and a foreign contractor working with US-led troops.

Pro-Iran groups have been ratcheting up their rhetoric, vowing to ramp up attacks to force out the ""occupying"" US forces, and there have been almost daily attacks on coalition supply convoys across the mainly Shiite south.

The United States last week committed to withdraw all remaining combat forces from Iraq, although the two countries did not set a timeline for what would be a second US withdrawal since the 2003 invasion which toppled Saddam Hussein.

- Sworn foes -

The announcement came as the Biden administration resumed a ""strategic dialogue"" with the government of Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi, who is seen as too close to Washington by pro-Iranian groups.

Biden last week announced a full US pullout from Afghanistan by the 20th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks that also led to the US-led invasion of Saddam Hussein's Iraq three years later.

Sworn foes Tehran and Washington have both since had a presence in Iraq, where 2,500 US troops are still deployed and Iran sponsors the Hashed al-Shaabi, a state-integrated paramilitary coalition.

Tensions have spiked to the edge of war, in particular after Trump ordered a drone strike near Baghdad airport in January 2020 that killed top Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani.

0,Belarus: Two men accused of planning coup arrested in Moscow. The Russian government said it had arrested two men who were planning to attempt a coup in Belarus and intended to assassinate President Alexander Lukashenko,https://www.dw.com/en/belarus-two-men-accused-of-planning-coup-arrested-in-moscow/a-57241861,"Russian authorities on Saturday announced they had arrested two men in Moscow for allegedly planning a coup in Belarus. The two Belarusian men, Yuri Zyankovich and Alexander Feduta, were allegedly planning to carry out the coup attempt in Minsk on May 9, a day when Belarus celebrates victory over the Nazis.

Russia's principal security agency, the FSB, said the men sought to carry out an assassination of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. The Russian agency said the two men have been handed over to Belarus.

The FSB claimed the two men were in Moscow to meet with anti-Lukashenko Belarusian generals to discuss the plot.

Who were the suspects?

Lukashenko confirmed the arrests and said he believes the US government is behind the alleged operation. One of the suspects, Zyankovich, also holds American citizenship.

Feduta had gone missing in Moscow earlier this month. He had reportedly arrived in Russia in late March. He previously served as Lukashenko's first press secretary in 1994, before falling out with him the following year. He has since become one of the leading opposition figures to the Belarusian president.

Lukashenko, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has served as the country's president for the past 27 years. In September, Lukashenko was accused of rigging the presidential election against opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, a claim he denies.

Could the coup allegations be made up by Russia and Belarus?

Tsikhanouskaya's senior advisor, Franak Viacorka, said on Twitter he believes the arrests of the two men are a ""provocation"" organized by the secret services of Russia and Belarus.

Opponents of Myanmar's junta announced a National Unity Government on Friday including ousted members of parliament and leaders of anti-coup protests and ethnic minorities, saying their aim was to end military rule and restore democracy.

Myanmar has been in turmoil since the Feb. 1 coup that ousted a civilian government led by democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi which had held power for five years and was starting its second term after a landslide election victory in November.

People have taken to the streets day after day to demand the restoration of democracy, defying crackdowns by the security forces in which more than 700 people have been killed, according to a monitoring group.

At the same time, political leaders, including ousted members of parliament from Suu Kyi's party, have been trying to organize to show the country and the outside world that they and not the generals are the legitimate political authority.

""Please welcome the people's government,"" veteran democracy activist Min Ko Naing said in a 10-minute video address announcing the formation of the National Unity Government (NUG).

While setting out few positions, Min Ko Naing said the will of the people was the unity government's priority, while acknowledging the scale of the task at hand.

""We're trying to get this out from the roots so we have to sacrifice a lot,"" he said, referring to the junta.

A spokesman for the junta could not be reached for comment.

The generals justified their takeover with accusations of fraud in the November election won by Suu Kyi's party, though the election commission dismissed the objections.

One of the unity government's primary objectives will be to win international support and recognition.

""We are the democratically elected leaders of Myanmar,"" said the unity government's minister of international cooperation, Dr Sasa, who goes by one name.

""So if the free and democratic world rejects us that means they reject democracy.""

International pressure has been building on the Myanmar military, particularly from Western governments that have imposed limited sanctions, though the generals have a long record of dismissing what they see as outside interference.

The unity government released a list of office holders including members of ethnic minorities and protest leaders, underlining the unity of purpose between the pro-democracy movement and autonomy-seeking minority communities, some of whom have battled the central government for decades.

CLAPPING IN THE DARK

Suu Kyi, who has been in detention since the coup, was listed as state counsellor, the post she held in government.

The only known communication she has had with the outside world since the coup has been monitored video calls with her lawyers.

A spokesman for the democratic politicians said while they could not inform her about their new government, he was sure she was aware of what was happening.

Sasa told Reuters the objective was to end violence, restore democracy and build a ""federal democratic union"". The military, while playing lip service to the idea of federalism, has long seen itself as the core power holding the country together.

Unity government leaders said they intended to form a federal army and were in talks with ethnic minority forces.

The Special Advisory Council for Myanmar, a group of international experts including former United Nations officials, hailed the creation of the NUG as historic and said it was the legitimate government.

After darkness fell over Myanmar's biggest city Yangon, people clapped at their windows and chanted ""our government"", video posted by activists on Twitter showed. Some community groups reported the sound of explosions and gunfire shortly afterwards.

While the politicians were announcing the unity government, other opponents of military rule observed a ""silent strike"" staying home to mourn those killed or wearing black in small marches in half a dozen cities and towns, media reported.

Yangon's streets were largely deserted, residents said.

There were no immediate reports of violence at Friday's rallies.

The military has also been rounding up critics and state media announced arrest warrants for 20 doctors on charges of encouraging dissent in the armed forces. The junta is seeking more than 200 people, including several internet celebrities, actors and singers, on the same change.

The turmoil has alarmed Myanmar's neighbors in Southeast Asia who have been trying to encourage talks between the rival sides.

Leaders of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which includes Myanmar, will meet in Indonesia on April 24 to discuss the situation, Thai and Indonesian media reported.

Junta leader Senior General Min Aung Hlaing was due to attend, a Thai broadcaster said, but the Jakarta Post said it had not been confirmed whether the summit would include representatives of the junta or the former government.

Sasa said ASEAN should not invite ""murderer-in-chief"" Min Aung Hlaing.",812,5149,35,236
0,Australian federal police have launched a fresh investigation into former soldier Ben Roberts-Smith after it was alleged he buried sensitive material in his backyard and attempted to intimidate a witness in an active investigation into war crimes.,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/apr/14/australian-federal-police-investigating-fresh-allegations-against-ex-soldier-ben-roberts-smith,"The Australian federal police has launched a fresh investigation into former soldier Ben Roberts-Smith after it was alleged he buried sensitive material in his backyard and attempted to intimidate a witness in an active investigation into war crimes.

The AFP deputy commissioner, Ian McCartney, told a Senate estimates hearing on Wednesday that police had opened an investigation into the new allegations.

The Nine Network has alleged that Roberts-Smith buried – in a child’s lunchbox in his backyard – USB sticks containing classified information including operational reports from an SAS mission in southern Afghanistan, drone footage and photos.

The Nine report also alleged Roberts-Smith, a winner of the Victoria Cross, sent emails and letters intimidating people he believed would give evidence against him to war crimes investigators.

Audio recordings published by Nine allegedly reveal Roberts-Smith speaking candidly about seeking retribution against politicians, journalists and other former soldiers who have opposed him.

“I’m going to do everything I can to fucking destroy them, mate … that’s my sole fucking mission in life,” he allegedly said.

McCartney confirmed: “The AFP has opened an investigation into aspects of that media reporting.” He declined to say whether the AFP was in possession of USB drives. “Given it’s an ongoing investigation we’d prefer not to provide a running commentary.”

McCartney would not confirm any of the particulars of the investigation but made the general observation that witness intimidation was a serious issue.

“Some of the allegations that have been raised are serious and it’s being treated as a priority by the Australian federal police,” he said.

Roberts-Smith, one of Australia’s most decorated soldiers, is suing the publishers of the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times over articles he says defamed him when reporting he was alleged to have committed war crimes in Afghanistan between 2009 and 2012.

Roberts-Smith has consistently denied all claims made against him. A statement issued on his behalf on Wednesday denied the new allegations.

“The allegations that he ‘hid’ or failed to disclose material to the inspector general of the ADF during the Afghanistan inquiry is false,” the statement said. “Mr Roberts-Smith fully cooperated with the Afghanistan inquiry.

“The allegations that he threatened any witnesses or potential witness to the inspector general … to stop them giving evidence is false. The allegations he buried USBs in his backyard is false. This simply did not happen.”

Arthur Moses, acting for Roberts-Smith, told a federal court directions hearing that the publication of the allegations ahead of the June defamation trial was an abuse of process.

“Eight weeks out from a trial, there is a concerted effort by the respondents to publish material prejudicial to the trial. That is an abuse – if they want to run the case then they should do it properly.”

The AFP has previously confirmed it was investigating allegations of war crimes committed by Australian soldiers in Afghanistan but has refused to confirm or deny specific incidents or identify who it was investigating.

A report last year by the inspector general of the Australian defence force, Paul Brereton, found credible evidence to support allegations Australian special forces troops were involved in the murder of 39 Afghan civilians, in some cases executing prisoners to “blood” junior soldiers before inventing cover stories and planting weapons on corpses.

Maj Gen Justice Paul Brereton described the special forces’ actions as a “disgraceful and a profound betrayal” of the ADF.",568,3661,37,247

Maj. Gen. Edgard Arevalo, Armed Forces of the Philippines spokesperson and Balikatan director, said that except for one drill, most of this year’s activities would be limited to interoperability tabletop exercises and expertise exchanges.

The only “kinetic” drill set for the 36th Balikatan exercises will be the simulated close air support or Simcas and live fire event to be held on April 20 at the Colonel Ernesto Rabina Air Base in Pampanga. It will not require face-to-face interaction among participants.

“It will simulate the need to employ air capability while observing the procedures involved during call for fire,” Arevalo said.

“What we’re training for is the respective roles of the US Armed Forces and the AFP in responding if the Mutual Defense Treaty is triggered or activated,” he added.

Until April 23

At the same time, there will also be subject matter exchanges pertaining to air and maritime interdiction, as well as COVID-19 pandemic response.

The exercise scenario will likewise involve the dispatch of aircraft from the American base in Okinawa, Japan, in response to a call from ground forces for fire support.

This year’s exercises will run until April 23. There was no Balikatan in 2020 due to the pandemic.

In a message to reporters, Arevalo said, “The intent of every iteration of Balikatan [was] for both armed forces to train together on defense and security leveraging on the capability, experience and strength of their friendship.”

According to him, “Balikatan is done annually to ensure interoperability in terms of command, control, computers, communications, intelligence, surveillance reconnaissance, and subject matter expert exchanges.”

Shopping malls, gyms, dine-out service at restaurants and some weekly markets will be shut during the weekend and only essential services would remain operational, Mr Kejriwal said.

India reported a record 200,000 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday and the financial hub of Mumbai entered a lockdown, as many hospitals treating coronavirus patients reported severe shortages of beds and oxygen supplies.

The surge was the seventh record daily increase in the last eight days and comes as India battles a massive second wave of infections that has its epicentre in the economically significant state of Maharashtra, home to Mumbai. The western state accounts for about a quarter of the country's total cases.

India reported 200,739 Covid-19 cases over the last 24 hours, according to Health Ministry data released on Thursday.

Deaths stood at 1,038, taking the total to 173,123.

The total caseload reached 14.1 million, second only to the United States, which leads the global tally with 31.4 million cases.

Hospitals and doctors in Maharashtra as well as other regions, including Gujarat and Delhi in the north, reported chaotic scenes as healthcare facilities were overwhelmed with a surge in admissions of Covid-19 patients.

""The situation is horrible. We are a 900-bed hospital, but there are about 60 patients waiting and we don't have space for them,"" said Dr Avinash Gawande, an official at the Government Medical College and Hospital in Nagpur, a commercial hub in Maharashtra.

Hospitals in other places including Gujarat, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state, reported oxygen shortages.

""If such conditions persist, the death toll will rise,"" the head of a medical body in Ahmedabad wrote in a letter to the Gujarat state chief minister.

India's government said the country was producing oxygen at its full capacity everyday for the last two days and it had boosted output.

""Along with the ramped up production of the oxygen manufacturing units and the surplus stocks available, the present availability of oxygen is sufficient,"" the Health Ministry said in a statement on Thursday.

Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of pilgrims still thronged to a religious festival in the north of the country on Wednesday, stoking fears of a new surge in Covid-19 cases in the region.

In capital Delhi, too, daily Covid-19 cases are hitting new records, with doctors warning the surge could be deadlier than in 2020.

""This virus is more infectious and virulent... We have 35-year olds with pneumonia in intensive care, which was not happening last year,"" said Dr Dhiren Gupta, a paediatrician at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in New Delhi. ""The situation is chaotic.""",458,2882,39,249

Islamist party Tehreek-e-Labbaik played a major role in fomenting this week’s anti-French protests in Pakistan, prompting Islamabad to announce the group’s dissolution on Thursday as France’s embassy told French nationals to leave the country over safety fears.

The Pakistani government blocked social media and instant messaging apps for several hours on Friday to try to prevent further violence, a day after Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed announced the dissolution of Tehreek-e-Labbaik (TLP) under the country's anti-terrorism law.

The party’s leader, Saad Rivzi, was arrested on Monday, hours after he called for a new march demanding the expulsion of the French ambassador. His detention triggered days of unrest.

After emerging from the socially conservative Barelvi school of Islam – which is the dominant strain in Pakistan, officially an ""Islamic Republic"" – the TLP has established itself as a major player in Pakistani politics by campaigning for the death penalty for anyone found guilty of blasphemy, which remains a criminal offence in the country.

“TLP was originally created as a political movement to demand the release of a bodyguard accused of having assassinated the governor of the Punjab region in 2011,” explained Jean-Luc Racine, a specialist in the Indian subcontinent and an emeritus research director at the CNRS think-tank in Paris. In 2015 it became a political party headed by Khadim Hussein Rizvi, the father of the current leader.

France became one of the TLP’s targets when the Charlie Hebdo trial started in September 2020. The gruesome massacre of 12 people at the satirical weekly’s office in January 2015 was the first major incident in a wave of Islamist violence in which more than 250 people have since been killed in France.

A month after the start of the trial, France was shaken by the October 16 beheading of teacher Samuel Paty by a Chechen Islamist militant outraged by his decision to share Charlie Hebdo’s controversial cartoons of the prophet Mohammed in a class discussing freedom of expression. Paty showed the images to his civics class while emphasising that students could choose not to look at them if they were offended.

In response to Paty’s murder, President Emmanuel Macron vowed that France would never give up its liberal Enlightenment values, including the right to mock religion. He hailed the slain teacher as a “hero” for representing the secular, free-thinking values of the French Republic. France has a long tradition of caricatures taking on political and religious authorities – including Charlie Hebdo’s mockery of Catholicism.

The weeks that followed saw mass protests in Muslim countries – with people taking to the streets and burning French flags and images of the French president. In Pakistan, the TLP played a central role in fomenting the demonstrations. The party demanded that Pakistan sever diplomatic relations with France and send the French ambassador, Marc Baréty, packing.

The Pakistani government signed an agreement with the party to convince it to dial down the protests – agreeing to the boycott of French products and promising a parliamentary vote by April 20 on expelling the French ambassador.

But as that deadline approached, Islamabad distanced itself from the TLP – a position underscored by Rizvi’s arrest on April 12. More than 200 TLP activists were arrested during the subsequent clashes with police. At least two police officers were killed and at least 340 people were wounded.

The TLP’s electoral strength has so far between limited. In the 2018 parliamentary elections it won just 2 million votes in a country with a population exceeding 210 million. But the party wields influence through its formidable capacity to mobilise its activists. “That’s its strength,” Racine said. “The TLP can get a huge quantity of protesters onto the streets and block roads for days.”

Demand for Asia Bibi’s execution

In 2017, the TLP spearheaded protests in the Pakistani capital Islamabad over a minor change to the oath taken by electoral candidates referring to the Prophet Muhammad. The government said it was a “clerical error” and soon U-turned. But the demonstrations continued – with at least six people killed and some 200 people injured – until Pakistan’s federal law minister resigned, acceding to the protesters’ demand.

The Islamist party then gained international notoriety in 2018, when the Asia Bibi affair hit the world’s headlines. A member of Pakistan’s persecuted Christian minority, she was arrested in 2010 for alleged blasphemy and spent eight years on death row until she was acquitted. In response to her acquittal, the TLP organised mass demonstrations calling for her to be sentenced to death.

“The TLP is relatively popular among young people, especially in the Pakistani working class,” Racine said. “That is because the party’s policy platform is not just about changing how Islam is practiced in the country – but also about tackling Pakistan’s socioeconomic inequality. This obviously speaks to young people in precarious positions, who are losing out under the current system.”

“This week’s events show that Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government is unable to negotiate with radical movements,” Racine continued. “They’re popular among large sections of the population – so the government finds it difficult to take a firm stance against them.”

Pakistani journalist Zahid Hussain expressed a similar view in the country’s English-language daily Dawn: “The government only managed to postpone the crisis. What has been happening now was inevitable. The way the administration has collapsed in the face of mob violence is alarming to say the least, and underscores how we are failing to deal with rising religious extremism.”

So why did the Pakistani government change tack and decide to shut down the TLP entirely?

“They could be thinking that dissolving the TLP might help improve Pakistan’s image abroad, seeing as the country has long been criticised for financing terrorism,” Racine said, although he noted that there is no evidence the TLP has “anything to do with other terrorist groups present in Pakistan, including the Taliban”.

An anonymous Pakistani diplomatic source told French newspaper Le Figaro on Thursday that “Pakistan wants to normalise relations with France” and that “Pakistan’s interior minister publicly expressed his concern on Wednesday that his country’s reputation is suffering because of the TLP’s actions”.

But Racine warned that getting rid of the party would by no means get rid of the movement: “There’s been a repeated phenomenon in Pakistani history in which the government bans radical groups and then they re-emerge in other forms and with other names.”

Although protests have died down since Friday, Racine said “it remains to be seen how TLP activists will act without a leader and without an institutional framework” after Rizvi’s arrest and the group’s official dissolution.

The government says the industry, which contributed 0.76% to the country’s GDP in 2020, is important in resuscitating an economy bogged down by the COVID-19 pandemic, by generating revenue and jobs and contributing to Duterte’s flagship infrastructure program.

Duterte’s pivot in favor of mining goes back to 2019, when the government allowed the operation of suspended mining firms and pushed for the rehabilitation of government-owned mines, particularly nickel mines, to cater to Chinese demand for nickel.

The mining sector was the deadliest in the world for environmental and land defenders in 2019, according to Global Witness; the Philippines has the most mining-related killings that year, and activists warn the new order could further endanger defenders as well as open key biodiversity areas to mining.

MANILA — President Rodrigo Duterte has issued an order to lift a nine-year moratorium on granting new mining permits in the Philippines. The order is expected to ease the entry of at least 291 existing mining applications, escalating threats to the environment and its defenders, anti-mining and environmental groups say.

Signed April 14 and made public April 15, Executive Order 130 highlights the contribution of the extractives sector in reviving the country’s economy amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

The sector is expected to support important projects like Duterte’s flagship “Build, Build, Build” infrastructure program, which the government says is pivotal to economic recovery. More mining would also create more jobs, the government says, in the country with one of the highest unemployment rates in Southeast Asia. Some 190,000 people were employed in mining in the Philippines before the pandemic, according to data from the Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB).

While other sectors in the country have declined due to the pandemic and the lockdowns imposed in response to it, mining actually grew by 1.13%, driven mainly by nickel demand from China and a high gold price. The precious metal peaked at $2,000 per ounce last August and is expected to average at $1,700 this year as investors seek out a safe-haven asset.

While mining industry revenue contributed just 0.76% of the Philippines’ GDP in 2020, according to the Philippine Statistics Office, the government expects an increase in earnings from excise tax collections. It attributes this to the Tax Reform for Acceleration of Inclusion (TRAIN) Act passed in 2017, which “doubled the rate of excise tax on minerals, mineral products and quarry resources from 2% to 4%.”

The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and the Department of Finance are expected to “formulate the terms and conditions in the new mineral agreements that will maximize government revenues and share from production, including the possibility of declaring these areas as mineral reservations to obtain appropriate royalties, in accordance to existing laws, rules, and regulations,” the executive order stated.

As the government anticipates a boon, anti-mining and human rights groups say lifting the moratorium on new mines will be anything but. They expressed dismay at Duterte’s executive order, which they say marks a complete pivot to a sector he condemned extensively in the early years of his presidency.

“President Duterte has completed his turnaround, from claiming to protect and stop the destruction of forests by destructive mining, to a pro-mining president,” Alyansa Tigil Mina (ATM), a coalition of anti-mining groups, said in a message to Mongabay. “Lifting the moratorium exposes this administration’s support for mining projects that will impact our water, food supply, forest, biodiversity, Indigenous communities and fragile island ecosystems.”

Rallying industry

When he assumed office in 2016, Duterte was outspoken in his opposition to mining, which he blamed for degrading the environment. He imposed a ban on open-pit mining in 2017 and appointed Gina Lopez, a staunch anti-mining advocate, as secretary of the DENR. In her one year in office, Lopez oversaw the closure and/or suspension of permits for 26 mining operations found in violation of environmental regulations.

By 2019, anti-mining groups noted that Duterte had gone quiet over mining, making no mention of the sector in his public speeches. That same year, the DENR’s MGB recommended the reopening of mines shuttered under Lopez’s watch, including the operation of the OceanaGold-operated Didipio gold mines in Nueva Vizcaya province whose permit lapsed that same year.

While Duterte’s policies on mining have caused instability in the sector, experts anticipated the domestic industry would rebound after neighboring Indonesia, the world’s biggest nickel producer, imposed an export ban on the metal in January 2020. The Philippines, the No. 2 producer, stepped in to fill nickel demand from China, exporting 333,962 tonnes last year.

Even amid strict government-imposed lockdowns that banned travel by land, air or sea, the mining industry was allowed to continue operating in the Philippines. This raised tensions with local governments, which wanted mining operations halted to curb the spread of COVID-19.

Last October, Secretary of Finance Carlos Dominguez III announced the government’s plan to revive the mining industryby privatizing government-owned mines, including two abandoned nickel mines in Surigao del Norte province and Marinduque province. That same month, Duterte lifted an oil exploration moratorium in what the Philippine government calls the West Philippine Sea, an area it claims in the South China Sea.

These government decisions boosted mining and oil stocks on the Philippine bourse. The sector closed 17.5% higher by the end of 2020, making it one of the biggest gainers amid the pandemic.

Duterte’s new order has had an immediate impact: Hours after he lifted the mining moratorium, the mining and oil index rose 5.38% by the close of trade on April 15.

Risk to environment, defenders

On the ground, various groups have warned that the executive order is poised to escalate threats to the environment and its defenders.

Mining was the deadliest sector for environmental and land defenders in the world in 2019, according to the watchdog Global Witness. That year, the Philippines topped the list of countries with the highest number of mining-linked deaths of environmental defenders.

Among the 16 fatalities that year was Datu Kaylo Bontolan, an Indigenous Manobo leader on the southern island of Mindanao, who was murdered after opposing illegal mining in his community in the Pantaron mountain range.

Displaced Indigenous groups in Mindanao have linked an ongoing government crackdown against them as cover to clear ancestral domain lands for mining companies, particularly small-scale Chinese firms with pending mining applications. Since 2000, Chinese investments in the Philippine mining sector have been channeled through “local elites in the artisanal small-scale mining (ASM) firms,” a study notes.

“This support to more mining projects will encourage more Chinese investments to extract nickel, black sand and copper minerals here in the Philippines,” anti-mining coalition Alyansa Tigil Mina said. “All these will only benefit Chinese demands and not Philippine industrialization.”

In Palawan province, one of the most biodiverse areas in the country, the order could potentially greenlight the operations of at least five mining applications, according to the Environmental Legal Assistance Center (ELAC). While the province is governed by a strategic environmental plan that bans mining, there has been an increase in mining applications, said ELAC executive director Grizelda Mayo-Anda.

“Existing mining companies which have been suspended … plan to expand their mining operations in Palawan,” she told Mongabay.

She added it’s especially alarming that these mining permits target areas of natural forest in the province, some of them within key biodiversity areas and protected areas.

“The DENR and the PCSD [Palawan Council for Sustainable Development] must be reminded that under the Strategic Environmental Plan for Palawan law (Republic Act 7611), all natural forests are areas of maximum protection or core zones,” Mayo-Anda said.

Leon Dulce, an activist with the Kalikasan People’s Network for the Environment (Kalikasan), said he was unconvinced the new order will uphold environmental protection, given that the country’s mining law gives permit holders complete access to natural resources within their concessions.

“The Mining Act provides auxiliary rights to mines that allow them to cut timber, deplete water, and ‘ease out’ communities away from their lands,” Dulce said in a message to Mongabay. “As part of its investment guarantees, the Mining Act commits government to ensuring the removal of obstacles to mining, and that includes conflicting land uses such as agricultural lands and communities.”

Dulce also noted provisions in the act that limit rehabilitation, such as token fines of just $1 per ton for companies disposing of waste in unauthorized areas, and similarly low compensation obligations for damage caused by mine waste and tailings. “That leaves all mines prone to ‘externalizing’ environmental costs,” Dulce said. “In other words, polluters will not pay.”

A court in Paris on Thursday handed down life sentences to two Ivorian officers and a Belarussian mercenary who were tried in absentia for the deadly 2004 bombing of French peacekeepers in Ivory Coast that triggered days of fierce clashes.

Ivorians Patrice Ouei and Ange Gnanduillet and Belarus national Yury Sushkin were found guilty of carrying out the raid near the Ivorian city of Bouaké on November 6, 2004, in which nine French soldiers and a US aid worker were killed.

The Bouaké bombing targeted a peacekeeping force deployed in a buffer zone between the government-controlled south of Ivory Coast and the rebel-held north.

It prompted a French retaliatory strike that wiped out Ivory Coast’s small air force, in turn triggering days of fierce clashes that saw French helicopters pluck people to safety as angry mobs hunted foreigners through the streets of Abdijan and other cities.

Thursday's verdict caps a protracted legal battle that has fuelled suspicions of a cover-up. The three men were tried in absentia having controversially evaded capture in the days following the raid.

Laurent Gbagbo, the then-Ivorian president whose relations with the former colonial power had already plummeted at the time, has always denied ordering the Bouaké airstrikes.

The case was brought by some 40 plaintiffs, including victims of the slain peacekeepers and some of the dozens of soldiers who were injured in the air strikes – the deadliest attack on French forces since the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing.

The plaintiffs were hoping the three weeks of hearings would help shed light on the many unanswered questions raised by a case that carries shades of France’s often murky dealings in its former African colonies.

How suspects got away

Shortly after the Bouaké airstrikes, the three suspects were identified in pictures taken by French intelligence at an airport near the capital, Yamoussoukro, standing next to the Sukhoi-25 planes used in the attack.

Ten days later, Yury Sushkin and seven other Belarussians were detained by Togolese authorities after travelling from Ivory Coast. Togo offered to turn them over to French authorities, who, in a twist that has puzzled investigators, suggested they be released instead.

It was the second time France had potentially allowed at least one of the suspects to slip away.

The day after the Bouaké airstrikes, French troops in Abidjan detained 15 mercenaries from Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, only to release them four days later.

According to investigators, French diplomats, soldiers and intelligence had been instructed “not to get involved” in the matter. Officials quizzed over the years have repeatedly argued that the priority then was to rescue French nationals living in Ivory Coast at the time.

Failure to apprehend the suspects has prompted scrutiny of the role of three senior cabinet ministers at the time: Michèle Alliot-Marie, then the defence minister, Dominique de Villepin, the former interior minister, and Michel Barnier, who held the foreign affairs portfolio.

Attempts to prosecute the three former ministers collapsed in 2019 when the Cour de justice de la République, the only court with the power to try ministers, chose not to take up the case.

Instead, the trio appeared as witnesses in the Paris trial, though they were unable to explain how the three suspects got away.

Senior French officials have long backed the hypothesis of an Ivorian military “blunder” orchestrated by Gbagbo’s government. Its aim, they argue, was either to turn the attention away from a failing campaign against northern rebels or to sever the country’s remaining ties with its former colonial power.

Among the plaintiffs, however, widespread frustration at the many roadblocks hit by investigators over the years has only heightened suspicions of a potential cover-up.

Along with Gbagbo’s entourage, some relatives of the victims suspect their loved ones were caught up in a botched operation aimed at discrediting the Ivorian president and justifying a French riposte.

Gbagbo was eventually forced from power in 2011, with the help of French peacekeeping forces, following a disputed presidential election won by his longtime rival, Alassane Ouattara.

Duterte has been accused of being silent at a time when Chinese ""maritime militia"" vessels have refused to withdraw the ships from Manila's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the South China Sea.

Several Filippino officials, including the country's top diplomat and the defence chief have openly objected to the Chinese provocative actions.

During an address on Thursday night, Duterte did not mention the South China Sea. His spokesman said earlier that the president preferred to pursue his ""diplomatic initiatives"" in ""private"", Al Jazeera reported.

Earlier on Thursday, the Philippine Coast Guard revealed that despite repeated demands by Manila that Chinese ships leave Whitsun Reef, at least 240 Chinese vessels remained in the area and surrounding waters as recently as Wednesday.

Senator Leila de Lima, an opposition member, had warned that the Philippines could become ""just another one of China's satellites"" if Duterte and the military failed to confront China.

De Lima said despite the expression of support by the United States towards Manila's position in the South China Sea, Duterte's ""policy of grovelling before China"" could prove detrimental to the integrity of the Philippine territory.

Since Duterte came to office in 2016, he has nurtured closer ties with China and has openly shown his disdain towards Washington, even threatening to end the US-Philippine military alliance.

Risa Hontiveros, another opposition senator, said it was time for Duterte to confront his ""best friend"" China, for its ""blatant deception"".



""China is truly intent on refusing any diplomatic means of resolving our disputes,"" she said.

Retired Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio, an international law expert, said unless Duterte speaks and defends the country's sovereignty, China will not take the Philippines position seriously.

""He must stand up for himself. Because if his subordinates do the talking, China will not listen. And if the president is silent, then China will continue ... the Chinese will take us seriously if the president will speak,"" Carpio said in an interview with ABS-CBN News Channel on Thursday.

""The maritime militia vessels are manned by the maritime militia under the payroll of the Chinese government. In fact, the maritime militia are placed under the command of the [Chinese] navy,"" he said.

The defence and foreign affairs ministries in the Philippines have been up in arms for a fortnight over the presence of 220 fishing boats suspected to be manned by Chinese maritime militia at Whitsun Reef, with statements flying back and forth over the alleged incursion into the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.

Secretary of Philippines Foreign Affairs Teddy Locsin Jnr said last Wednesday he was ""firing off another diplomatic protest"" to China's embassy and would continue objecting ""every day until the last one's gone like it should be by now if it is really fishing"".

Even after such an intensifying row, China hasn't shown any sign of relocation of the vessels. Instead, they have accused the Philippines of using a 2016 international tribunal ruling, which deprived China of certain outcrops of territorial-generating status, the ruling from the permanent court of arbitration effectively punches holes in China's all-encompassing ""nine-dash"" line that stretches deep into the South China Sea, as reported by the Sydney Morning Herald.

The 2016 International Tribunal Ruling denies China of its thousand years of fishing rights in the area.

China claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea and has overlapping territorial claims with Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Taiwan.

China has been increasing its maritime activities in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea over the past few months, partly in response to Beijing's concerns over the increasing US military presence in the region because of escalating Sino-US tensions.

Beijing's rising assertiveness against counter claimants in the East and South Sea has resulted in unprecedented agreement across the Indo-Pacific. (ANI)

Oueremi had faced 24 charges of mass murder, rape, and inhumane and degrading treatment over the violence in Duekoue, which occurred as Ivory Coast was in the grip of a post-election civil war.

The Red Cross says 817 people were killed in one day in Duekoue, while the UN puts the toll at 300.

Oueremi's lawyer said he did not deny the massacres, but that he was under the command of rebel chiefs.

Ivory Coast's cocoa-producing western region was the worst-hit during the 2010-11 post-election crisis.

Then president Laurent Gbagbo was eventually forced out of office after refusing to accept defeat by the current president, Alassane Ouattara.

The months-long conflict claimed some 3,000 lives and split the country along north-south lines.

Oueremi, 57, was head of a militia that fought alongside pro-Ouattara rebels against rival groups and forces loyal to Gbagbo, which have also been accused of atrocities.

According to the UN and other international organisations, the capture of Duekoue in March 2011 by pro-Ouattara fighters was accompanied by large-scale massacres.

The trial began on March 24 and has notably featured testimony from women who spoke of their husbands and other relatives being brutally killed in front of them.

0,"European car manufacturers linked to illegal deforestation: Carmakers like VW, BMW, Daimler, PSA and Renault have been linked to Amazon rainforest deforestation in a new study. It said the firms may be using leather from cattle raised on illegally deforested land for their seats",https://www.dw.com/en/amazon-rainforest-european-car-manufacturers-linked-to-illegal-deforestation-says-report/a-57225234,"Car seats from manufacturers like Volkswagen, BMW, Daimler, the PSA group (Peugeot, Citroen, Opel) and Renault could be linked to deforestation, the Rainforest Foundation Norway reported on Friday.

As the leading exporter of bovine leather, Brazil provides about 30% of this material to the global automotive industry. But before turned into car upholstery, the leather may have been removed from cattle raised on land in the Amazon rainforest that was deforested, possibly illegally.

""The purpose of the report is to give an overview of a sector that needs to be studied and that needs transparency,"" Joana Faggin, the study’s lead author, told DW. ""At the moment, no manufacturer can prove that it is not involved in this.""

The pace of deforestation is picking up. Last year, the Amazon rainforest lost 11,088 square kilometers (4,280 square miles) of land, the largest area cleared over a yearlong period within the last 12 years, according to Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research, INPE.

Cattle farming continues to be the motor driving the logging. More than 90% of deforestation is illegal, and a majority of that land is used for grazing, according to the Brazilian conservation NGO Imazon. Following the path of the animals that are raised on this land is a massive challenge.

""If European consumers want to know where the leather comes from, they will face many difficulties,"" said Faggin. ""This industry has a complex supply chain. It’s very difficult to follow the path of the product after the slaughterhouse.""

Leather follows an obscure route

To understand the origins of the leather the manufacturers use, the study delved into complex network of international commerce between Brazil and major importers around the world. It mapped these relations using company documents, studies detailing environmental crimes committed by Brazilian cattle farms, and information on Panjiva, a global trade database.



The analysis identified three primary export routes: Brazil to Asia (China, Indonesia and Thailand); Brazil to North America (Mexico and the United States); and Brazil to Europe (Italy, Germany and Slovenia).

To get from the Brazilian tanneries to the European car manufacturers, the raw material mostly passes through Italy. At this point, it is still chrome-tanned leather, known as wet blue.

After another round of processing, the material is sold on to car seat factories. The Czech Republic and Germany make up 22% and 13% of this global market, respectively. Here, the seats are finalized and then delivered to the car manufacturers.

According to the study, buyers can't be sure that material from major Brazilian suppliers didn't come from deforested areas.

""On the contrary, this report shows a high probability that deforestation is a factor in the leather supply chain,"" the document said.

Most of the material exported from Brazil comes from tanneries in the nine states in the Amazon basin, which use leather from cattle raised and slaughtered in the region.

The biggest suppliers to the European industries — JBS Couros, Minerva Couros, Vancouros, Fuga Couros, Durlicouros, Mastrotto Brasil and Viposa — all have some sort of link to deforestation, though it may not necessarily be illegal, according to the study.

Suppliers cheating the system?

The starting point in tracing the origins of the leather is the cattle. In Brazil, which has the world's biggest cattle herd with about 214 million cows, this path could prove difficult.

Half of these animals are raised in the Amazon, on land that encroaches on the forest. Many suppliers here cheat environmental laws to hide that they are selling cattle raised in deforested spaces and protected areas.

The most common practice translates to ""cattle washing,"" which means transferring the animals from illegal farms to legal farms before making the final sale, which evades the monitoring systems. The cows are then sent on to meat companies.

Making leather from Mexican cacti How it all began Two Mexican entrepreneurs, Adrian Lopez Velarde and Marte Cazarez, have developed the world's first vegan leather from the nopal cactus. Before hitting upon the idea for their alternative to animal leather the duo worked in the furniture, automotive and fashion industries, where they were exposed to animal cruelty.

Making leather from Mexican cacti Traditional leather According to animal rights group PETA, the global leather industry slaughters more than a billion animals and tans their skins and hides every year. Most leather produced and sold in the US is made from the skins of cattle and calves, but some is derived from sheep, lambs, goats and pigs.

Making leather from Mexican cacti The potential of plants The cactus-based material, which is known as Desserto, is similar to its animal counterpart in terms of flexibility, breathability and durability. As such, it could be a potential game-changer for the leather industry. It is partially biodegradable, although not completely because it contains some plastic.

Making leather from Mexican cacti Cacti in their natural habitat The cactus chosen for the leather — which grows in the central Mexican state of Zacatecas — is very resilient and strong and can survive in low winter temperatures. In the quest to remain pesticide-free and use little water, the entrepreneurs rely on rain and minerals abundant in the soil of Zacatecas to sustain their plants.

Making leather from Mexican cacti A cactus that doesn't hurt Although cacti can be hard on the hands, the thorns of the nopal cactus, which is also known as the prickly pear, are small enough for farmers to harvest them without too much difficulty. Once the mature leaves have been cut, they are dried under the sun for three days until they contain the right amount of water needed for successful processing.

Making leather from Mexican cacti A new challenge for the desert ecosystem The team only selects and cuts the leaves without damaging the cactus itself. This process enables them to re-harvest from the plants, which can also be used in Mexican cooking, every six-eight months.

""Everybody, including these companies, knows that the problem lies with the indirect suppliers. Even though the big companies have signed an agreement to stop this, none of them have made much progress in monitoring indirect suppliers,"" said Faggin.

Although the clandestine practice is well-known, companies that buy cattle from the Amazon have done little to minimize the risk, according to Paulo Barreto, a researcher with NGO Imazon.

The institute has developed a methodology that measures the degree of deforestation for each meat company in the region. It bases the measurement on the place where the cattle is bought, the distance of the meat company from the farm, and if there are highways nearby, among other information.

What leather exporters say

Of the seven exporters cited in the report, four replied to DW at the time of writing.

JBS, a giant in the meat and byproduct industry, denied any connection to deforestation, citing an online tool with which one can trace the source of its leather, JBS 360.

The company said it is dealing with the problem of illegal products from indirect suppliers with a platform called Transparent Livestock. Launched in 2020, it extends the ""reach to monitor the suppliers of its suppliers,"" and will bring a ""definitive solution"" by 2025.

Minerva said it signed a commitment to eliminate illegal deforestation from its supply chain, and that it plans on integrating a new tool ""to its geographic monitoring system of the Amazon that assesses the risks related to farms that are indirect suppliers."" The timeline is not clear.

The company, however, said it remains a challenge to accurately trace the origin of the leather. But it maintained that it has a tracking system for the material once it leaves the meat companies and tanneries to guarantee the source of ""100% of the leather processed in its facilities in Brazil.""

Vancouros and Viposa said they have policies and certifications in place to track their raw material.

What manufacturers say

Responding to the report, Volkswagen criticized its alleged inaccuracies.

""For the brands in the Volkswagen Group, we can state: Leather from Brazil is usually chrome-tanned. However, the Volkswagen Group only uses chrome-free tanned leather in Europe,"" it said.

The manufacturer said it has ""written agreements"" from all its suppliers that none of their material can be linked to illegal deforestation in the Amazon.

BMW said it had the same guarantee from its suppliers. Brazilian leather currently represents 5% of its total stock, according to the company.

""It will account for 1% at the end of next year. This will decrease to 0% in the medium term as we restructure our leather supply chains and no longer rely on leather from South America,"" it said in a statement.

Daimler (top), BMW and VW are among the German car manufacturers cited in the report

Daimler, which produces Mercedes-Benz, said it demands in its contracts with suppliers that the products not be connected to illegal deforestation.

PSA preferred not to give a statement until it had access to the full report, while Renault did not respond to a request for comment.

More certification, international pressure needed

Some exporters said they used the Leather Working Group (LWG), which provides internationally accepted environmental certification for ethical leather manufacturers. But the organization may have some limitations in guaranteeing the origins of its material, according to the Rainforest Foundation Norway.

""The supplier provides a declaration to the LWG saying it has no connection to deforestation. There is no rigorous verification,"" Faggin said about the certification process.

The authors of the report said the automotive industry is complicit if it continues to buy raw materials coming from deforested areas in the Amazon.

""It is highly likely that all of the big five car manufacturers in Europe are sourcing leather from Brazilian companies linked to deforestation,"" the study said.

Paulo Barreto of NGO Imazon said it's important that the issue be in the international spotlight.

""Monitoring where leather comes from is even more complicated than for meat. We had some changes because of international pressure, but they are too small given the magnitude of the problem,"" he said. ""Much more effort is needed.""",1717,10777,44,279

SEOUL--A South Korean steelmaker on Friday said it plans to end a joint venture with a military-controlled firm in Myanmar following criticism that its business has benefited military leaders who have violently suppressed pro-democracy protests there.

POSCO Coated & Color Steel said it has decided to discontinue its partnership with Myanmar Economic Holdings Public Co. Ltd, which is about 40 percent owned by Myanmar’s Defense Ministry. However, the South Korean company said it would not pull out of Myanmar.

POSCO C&C owns 70 percent of its joint venture with MEHL, Myanmar POSCO C&C. Min Ji-hyun, an official from POSCO C&C, said the company has informed MEHL it wants to buy the Myanmar firm’s 30 percent stake so that it can continue operating the venture with full ownership. MEHL has yet to respond to POSCO C&C’s offer, Min said.

Min said he couldn’t provide detailed estimates on how much the deal would cost POSCO C&C, saying that would depend on when it goes through. He said the company will look for “other ways” to continue doing business in Myanmar if MEHL refuses to sell its stake but did not elaborate on what those might be.

Human rights activists have been pressuring many companies around the globe to end any financial support for the military. The U.S. government has imposed sanctions on MEHL and a similar military-controlled conglomerate, Myanmar Economic Corp.

POSCO C&C is an affiliate of South Korean steel giant POSCO that manufactures steel sheets. The company issued a statement saying it hopes its steel business will “continue to contribute in improving living environments in Myanmar and facilitate the country’s economy.”

A military junta took over Myanmar from an elected civilian government in a Feb. 1 coup. Security forces have killed at least 700 civilian protesters and bystanders, have detained the former government’s leaders, and have charged doctors, entertainers and others with crimes over their opposition to the coup.

In a statement, the rights group Justice for Myanmar said it cautiously welcomed Posco C&C’s decision but urged it to “immediately end all other business ties with the Myanmar military junta and its conglomerates.""

That includes rent on land leased by entities associated with the military, it said.

The statement was jointly issued with the Korean Civil Society in Support of Democracy in Myanmar, a network of more than 100 rights groups. That group said that it had joined with other advocacy organizations to file a complaint with South Korea’s National Human Rights Commission and other agencies to protest business ties between Korean companies and the military.

Suga made the request during telephone talks with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla on the last day of his three-day visit to Washington for a White House meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden.

Bourla was quoted by the officials as saying Pfizer would like to promote consultations about the request swiftly and coordinate closely with the Japanese government.

The talks came as Japan trails far behind Britain, the United States and elsewhere in providing vaccinations to people.

Japan relies solely on imported coronavirus vaccines, and Pfizer's vaccine is the only one the country has approved so far.

During the summit meeting on Friday, Suga and Biden agreed to work together to help ensure fair access to coronavirus vaccines for developing countries and facilitate the production of safe, effective, and affordable vaccines in the Indo-Pacific region, including by expanding their manufacturing capacity in India.

The humanitarian and economic crisis unleashed by the eruption of the La Soufriere volcano on the Caribbean island of Saint Vincent will last months and could extend to nearby islands, a UN official warned Wednesday.

""It is a crisis that will require a humanitarian response but also a response in terms of rehabilitation"" which could last for several months, said Didier Trebucq, the United Nations coordinator for Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean.

Trebucq, speaking to reporters in New York via videoconference from Barbados, said that the volcano—which had not erupted since 1979—remains active and every day belches up clouds of ash and smoke after erupting on April 9.

The islands of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines have around 110,000 inhabitants, 20,000 of whom had to be evacuated from their homes.

About 4,000 people have been moved to shelters but ""this number is growing,"" Trebucq said.

On Wednesday a French navy ship, Le Ventose, reached Saint Vincent with water and 75 tonnes of humanitarian aid.

Trebucq said that it was hard to know how long the crisis will last. ""Everything will depend on the duration of the volcanic eruptions,"" he said. ""It is possible that it will last a few weeks, it is also possible that it lasts several months.""

The eruption will have a medium and long term impact on Saint Vincent as well as nearby islands including Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda, and others.

The French islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe may also be impacted ""depending on the direction of the winds and where the volcanic ash is deposited,"" he said.

In calling for more robust international aid Trebucq noted that hurricane season in the Caribbean is set to begin in two months, and that tourism, the main source of income for the islands, has been severely curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Premier Doug Ford announced the new restrictions during a news conference at Queen’s Park on Friday afternoon. It comes in the wake of new modelling which warns that virtually every ICU bed in the province could be occupied by a COVID-19 patient by this time next month.

“I have never shied away from telling you the brutal, honest truth, never shied away from tough decisions and today I am here to do just that. My friends we are losing the battle between variants and vaccines,” Ford said in making the announcement. “We are on our heels but if we dig in and remain steadfast we can turn this around. We are down but by no means are we out.”

As of Monday checkpoints will be set up at Ontario’s provincial borders with Quebec and Manitoba and visitors will be prohibited from entering the province except for essential purposes, such as work, medical care or the transportation of goods.

The Ford government is also shutting down non-essential construction work sites and ordering the immediate closure of all recreational amenities, including playgrounds, golf courses, tennis courts, basketball courts and soccer and baseball fields as of this weekend.

Meanwhile, the stay-at-home order will be extended for another two weeks and will now remain in effect until at least May 20.

The last stay-at-home order introduced in January was largely enforced on a complaint-only basis but Solicitor General Sylvia Jones said on Friday that police will now temporarily have the authority to stop and question people about their reason for leaving home and ask them for their address. She said that all Ontarians will also be required to carry identification and produce to any law enforcement officer that makes the request.

“I cannot stress this enough, it is imperative that everyone limit their trips outside of the home to permitted purposes only, such as going to the grocery store or pharmacy, medical appointments, outdoor exercise, or for work that cannot be done remotely,” Jones said.

Ford’s cabinet met late into the night on Thursday

The Ford government has introduced escalating restrictions on three consecutive Fridays as it has worked to curb the spread of COVID-19 and protect the healthcare system amid concerns that surging hospitalizations will soon force doctors to make difficult decisions about who to treat.

Nonetheless case counts have continued to climb with a record 4,812 new infections being reported on Friday morning.

The modelling released earlier on Friday warned that even with additional restrictions the number of patients with COVID-19 in intensive care units will likely reach 1,500 by this time next month. In the worst case scenario it could near 2,000. Ontario only has about 2,300 ICU beds available on any given day and hospitals are facing a staffing crunch as they quickly try to ramp up capacity.

“I know that the majority of Ontario residents are doing the right thing. They're following the rules and keeping each other safe. But we need to step up enforcement and we need to focus on those who are deliberately putting others at risk by ignoring the stay-at-home order,” Ford said on Friday. “Those gathering in large groups are continuing to put themselves and others at risk so understand the restrictions will be strongly, strongly enforced because they must be. We know that when they are followed these measures work.”

Ford’s cabinet met late into the night on Thursday and again on Friday morning to consider the new restrictions and the news conference to announce them ended up being pushed back twice.

Speaking with reporters, Ford said the “difficult truth” is that there were only a few options left to his government in response to the surging case counts and every one of them “comes with a massive cost to people in their lives.”

But a number of epidemiologists and public health experts are criticizing Ford for not doing enough to protect the essential workers while focusing on reducing capacity at retail stores and closing down playgrounds.

The head of critical care at Michael Garron Hospital told CP24 Friday evening that the new measures announced are disappointing.

""I think what we learned today essentially seals the fate for Ontario. We're going to be triaging patients in Ontario's ICUs. My kids aren't going to be back to school this school year, and Premier Ford is going to have to have another press conference in the near future to say that what he planned today just isn't enough,"" Dr. Michael Warner said.

He pointed that the measures do not address the root cause of the surge in cases.

""The root cause is the fact that the people in my ICU right now, who are essential workers or related to them, do not have adequate protection from the virus. The modelling was very clear. The same people are getting nailed over and over again and it says very little to protect those individuals. And it's really unfortunate.""

Warner warned that Ontario will see 1,800 patients in the ICU as he said the government is not doing what's necessary to respond to the situation.

""We're on our own here. And the bleeding is not going to stop with the band aid,"" Warner said.

Dr. Andrew Boozary, executive director of social medicine at the University Health Network, said measures that do not include paid sick leave and other supports will not protect essential workers and racialized communities disproportionately affected by the pandemic.

""We've never seen how important workers' rights are than through this pandemic, which has made it a matter of life and death instantly,"" Boozary said.

""And when you look at policies like this and you speak about the disconnect, it's really hard to see how this government, this set of policies care about communities of colour -- communities that have been on fire, and people living in poverty.""

In a statement issued on Friday afternoon, NDP Leader Andrew Horwath said that the new restrictions effectively amount to “watered-down, weak changes.”

Horwath said that rather than playing the “blame game” by focusing on increased enforcement, Ford ought to “listen to the experts” and provide paid sick days to essential workers who often have to choose between going to work with symptoms and not paying rent.

“The vast majority of people are following the rules and public health advice. But busses are packed with essential workplaces. People feeling under the weather have to go in to work because they don’t have paid sick days. Employers are continuing non-essential functions because Ford allows them to,” Horwath said.

Here is a full list of all the new restrictions:

- Outdoor gatherings will be strictly limited to members of your household only

- Capacity in big box stores will be reduced to 25 per cent

- Capacity at religious services, weddings and funerals limited to 10 people indoors

- Non-essential construction projects will be prohibited",1179,7111,46,298

Petition to Label Criticism of Police as Hate Speech Was Authored By Liberal MP’s ‘Subject Matter Expert’

The author of a new House of Commons petition calling for criticism of police to be classified as hate speech is listed as a paid “subject matter expert” for Winnipeg MP Kevin Lamoureux.

Lamoureux controversially sponsored the petition and expressed his support for the petition’s aims.

The petition, authored by former Winnipeg Police officer Stan Tataryn, argues that police should be classified as an “identifiable group” under hate laws, something that would criminalize the use of language implying police are “despised, scorned, denied respect, and made subject to ill-treatment on the basis of group affiliation.”

Anti-hate groups say the petition perverts the purpose of hate laws, stressing that using hate speech legislation to shield police from public criticism is “extremely inappropriate.”

One thing Lamoureux did not previously disclose about the petition he sponsored is that the person who wrote it worked as his office’s in-house “expert.”

House of Commons records show that Tartaryn was paid thousands of dollars by Lamoureux’s office — expenditure reports show Tataryn received monthly payments of $510 between July and December 2020, totalling over $3,000.

The reports do not detail what kind of work Tataryn provided apart from describing him as a “subject matter expert.”

In a statement to PressProgress, Lamoureux’s office said Tataryn no longer works for their office, and characterized him not as a “subject matter expert” but as a “community outreach” worker.

“I can confirm this individual is no longer employed by our office, and that he worked in community outreach,” Lamoureux’s spokesperson told PressProgress.

Tataryn explained to PressProgress that he worked 30 hours a month doing community outreach in Lamoureux’s riding and that his “main function” was to “liaison with the non-profits in that area and keep them abreast of new government funding available to them and assist them in the application process.”

“My expertise was gained in thirty five years of Police Service,” Tataryn pointed out, noting that “twenty four of it in supervisory and administrative positions.”

“As for whether our relationship influenced MP Lamoureux to support our position, will get a question that he will have to answer,” Tataryn said.

Last week, Lamoureux told the Winnipeg Free Press he supports of the spirit of the petition, stating that he thinks there is a “great deal of merit for us to give more positive attention to law enforcement officers.”

“When it comes to law enforcement personnel, it takes just a few bad apples to portray a relatively negative image, and it’s not fair.”

Neither Lamoureux nor Tataryn, who is also the former president of the Liberal Party of Canada’s Manitoba chapter, disclosed these personal, partisan or financial connections in the newspaper’s front page story profiling Tataryn’s petition.

I was asked for a comment on this and I’m so upset with how this story turned out. For WFP to give this man such a platform – cover story! – and lend so much credence to his harmful position, is so disappointing. MSM needs to stop pandering to police in the name of ‘neutrality.’ https://t.co/PgNgcnQvAJ — Paula Ethans (@PaulaEthans) April 15, 2021

Community advocacy group Winnipeg Police Cause Harm believes this financial relationship should have been disclosed upfront.

“It’s unsettling and it just feels questionable,” Buck Doyle, a spokesperson for WPCH told PressProgress. “In this kind of realm, people should be honest and open about what is influencing them and Lamoureux did not take the moment to explain this existing relationship.”

“We know the police have a lot of power physically on the streets, but we also know they have a lot of informal power that we don’t always see in public,” Doyle said.

“I think this is an example of the ways they have an ‘in’ with politicians that other people don’t always have, and they exercise this power in different ways that we don’t always get to see. It’s just another example of the ways they wield their unchecked power.”

The petition has been criticized by local community and Indigenous groups, including most recently the Southern Chiefs Organization.

“When I heard about this petition, I had to make sure it was actually true,” said SCO Grand Chief Jerry Daniels in a press release.

“To equate the lived experience of police forces with First Nations and other racialized peoples is dumbfounding at best. It’s one thing to have a former member of the Winnipeg Police Service lead this misinformed and tone-deaf initiative, but to have a member of parliament take a lead role is extremely disheartening.”",780,4867,48,300

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden and Japan Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga showcased the alliance between their two countries as well as their shared resolve in dealing with China as they met at the White House on Friday in Biden’s first face-to-face talks with a foreign leader as president.

Suga and Biden, who wore masks for their meeting in a visit modified by precautions against the coronavirus, were seeking to challenge messaging from Chinese President Xi Jinping that America and democracies in general are on the decline following the political turmoil and international withdrawal that marked Donald Trump’s presidency.

At a press conference in the Rose Garden after their meeting, Biden stressed U.S. commitments to Japan’s defense and said the alliance — the U.S. is Japan’s only treaty ally — would “prove that democracies can still commit and win” and “deliver for our people.”

Managing the alliance with the United States is one of the trickiest tasks for any leader of Japan, whose economy depends heavily on China and whose security depends on the U.S. Friday’s talks featured unusually frank talk from a Japanese leader against any effort by China to dominate the Indo-Pacific region by “force or coercion.”

Suga also called for peace and stability in Taiwan, and urged China — whose disputed claim to Taiwan is a potential flashpoint in the region and with the United States — to peacefully resolve the dispute. China under Xi has been increasingly deploying its military to assert its sweeping territorial claims, helping prod the United States, Japan and some other Indo-Pacific nations to strengthen their alliance.

Mildly worded as that part of the two leaders’ statement was, it marked the first time a Japanese prime minister had spoken out in a communique with the United States on Taiwan since 1969 talks between Richard Nixon and Eisaku Sato.

Suga told Japanese reporters after his White House visit that the two leaders and their aides had spent much of their meetings, conducted around a table in the White House state dining room, sharing stories of their lives and careers. It left them so engrossed “we ended up not even touching our hamburger steak prepared for us,” Suga said.

“I think we were able to establish a good relationship of trust,” he added.

The Biden administration calls managing U.S. policies toward China and the Indo-Pacific the primary challenge for the United States. That helped guide Biden’s decision, announced this week, to pull U.S. troops out of Afghanistan and free the administration to focus more on East Asia.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi had warned his Japanese counterpart in a call ahead of Suga’s visit to see to it that China-Japan relations “do not get involved in the so-called confrontation between major countries.”

Suga, a farmer’s son who rose to Japan’s highest political office after an early stint as a worker in a cardboard factory, succeeded Shinzo Abe as prime minister last September after long serving as his chief Cabinet secretary.

Suga expressed eagerness to meet with Biden early on despite global COVID-19 lockdowns.

The pandemic changed the normal routine for a visit by a foreign leader, so Biden didn’t host Suga for any formal meal. Earlier Friday, Suga placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery and visited with Vice President Kamala Harris. An honor guard greeted his arrival at the White House.

Speaking to reporters with Biden after their meetings, Suga also spoke out against a surge in attacks on Asians in the United States amid the coronavirus pandemic, and he and Biden pledged to fight such crimes.

Biden turned to Suga at one point in their press conference to note the recent victory of Japanese golfer Hideki Matsuyama in the Masters Tournament. The 29-year-old is the first Japanese player to win at Augusta National.

“You’ve got a Japanese boy coming over here, and guess what? He won the Masters,” Biden said.

Their joint statement also expressed concern over human rights for residents of Hong Kong and for China’s ethnic Muslim minority, marking another step where Japan was acceding to a U.S. push for a public rebuke to China. Both countries, however, declared they planned to work with China “on areas of common interest.”

Japan long has moved cautiously on steps that might worsen relations with China, though Suga has been more outspoken. His administration pushed its comfort zone in a statement stressing “peace and stability” on the Taiwan Strait. That came during a visit last month by Secretary of State Tony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, which was the Biden administration’s highest-level face-to-face meeting at the time.

China tested U.S. and Taiwanese resolve weeks into the Biden administration by sending fighter jets and bombers near Taiwan.

Japan considers China’s growing military activity and broad territorial claims to be security threats. Japan is itself locked in a dispute with China over Beijing’s claim to the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands, called Diaoyu in China, in the East China Sea.

Elsewhere, Tokyo has watched with concern as China has built military installations on disputed territory it claims in the South China Sea.

U.S. ships regularly conduct so-called freedom of navigation operations, sailing into international waters that China claims as its own.

Biden as president has taken a different approach to China’s growing assertiveness and other global challenges, reaching out to allies as a first step.

President Barack Obama was seen as cajoling China, in hopes of encouraging reforms. After initially praising Xi, Trump later took on China head-on and solo, with tariffs and insults, while building a golf-buddy relationship with Suga’s predecessor, Abe.

The Biden-Suga meeting also saw new announcements on a series of alliance-building moves.

The U.S. and Japanese governments have been working to strengthen technology supply chains independent of China during a shortage of semiconductors that’s worrying businesses around the world. And both countries are expected in coming days to make deeper commitments to cutting climate-wrecking fossil fuel emissions, in line with Biden’s climate summit with 40 world leaders next week.

DCCC536 / 2020 / Statement of Margaret Ng Ngoi Yee (D3)

Your honour, I am grateful to your honour for allowing me to make this statement about my background and the personal conviction I have held in what I did. I was called to the bar in 1988, but my early training was not in law. I had indulgent parents who allowed me to spend 10 years in the university in Hong Kong and then in Boston to study philosophy. There I learned about rigorous intellectual honesty in the pursuit of truth and alleviation of the suffering of mankind.

It was a sharp change for me to switch to law in 1981 when I went to Cambridge to read for a law degree. Those were the crucial years of Sino British negotiations over the future of Hong Kong. My generation were embroiled in finding a way to preserve Hong Kong’s freedoms and original way of life after the change of sovereignty. This was so important to all of us that, after I was called to the bar, I did not immediately start to practise, but took up an editorial post in the Ming Pao Daily News, because I accepted that it was critical to Hong Kong’s future to have a strong free press, and at that stage I had some standing as a political commentator.

I resumed my legal career in 1990, but in 1995 I was persuaded to stand for election in the legal functional constituency. Your honour, the legal profession, steeped in the common law tradition of civil liberty, did not believe in unequal elections, but they considered that so long as there was such a seat, they would not allow anyone to compromise the rule of law in their name. So I was elected as their representative to hold that office in trust for the people of Hong Kong, to use it to uphold the system under which their rights and freedoms are protected by law. I was charged with a dual mission: to do my utmost to prevent legislation that would harm the rule of law, and to safeguard the institutions that underpin the rule of law. At the top of the list was judicial independence, and the administration of justice.

Those were the tasks to which I had voluntarily pledged to carry out. It meant, first of all, working conscientiously in LegCo’s committees. I served in LegCo for 18 years (including the year from July 1997 to August 1998 when I was without a seat), and for 17 of those years I sat as Chairman of the Panel of Administration of Justice and Legal Services which had oversight of policies concerning the Judiciary, judicial provisions and establishment, including the allocation of land and costs for court buildings, legal policies, legal aid, the organisation of the legal profession, legal services, and legal education. Numerous issues were brought up, discussed and resolved.

Some of the work required search for novel dispute resolution. At the height of the heated dispute within the profession over higher rights of audience for solicitors, I put the matter before the Chief Justice and respectfully asked him to intervene so that the matter may be resolved, and seen by all to be resolved, on the public interest and not by unseemly turf fight. It was vital for the rule of law that the public continued to have confidence in the legal profession.

The expansion of legal aid’s supplementary scheme, assistance for unrepresented litigants, more user-friendly and helpful free community legal advice were among other examples for which extra effort had to be made to find solutions. Often there were setbacks. In 2002, when Audrey Eu SC was also in LegCo, we worked in partnership with NGOs on a proposal for a community legal services centre, to give people timely and useful legal advice. Although it was rejected by the government at the time, in due course the idea bore fruit elsewhere.

I had found that, frequently, tact, diligence and patience were what was needed. But at other times, when a fundamental value was violated, strong statements and response were required. In June 1999, in the wake of the Court of Final Appeal’s landmark decision on the right of abode in Ng Ka Ling, the NPCSC issued its first interpretation of the Basic Law to overturn the court’s decision. This shook the world’s faith in the power of final adjudication of the court. In protest, on 30 June, I and over 600 members of the legal profession went on a silent march, and stood in quiet respect and in solidarity in front of the CFA building then on Battery Path, to mark our unswerving support for the court in that critical hour, so that the community may not be demoralized.

Your honour, the task in the defence of the rule law also meant commitment to the process of law-making. I devoted a great deal of my time to vetting bills. It is recorded that I had worked in 155 bills committees. It is vital to the rule of law that the laws passed by the legislature are sound, rights-based, and measure up to the highest standards. For, judges are bound to apply the law as it is not as what they would wish it to be. Lawyers are in a better position than most to know how a piece of legislation would work – or would not work – when it comes to be tested in the courts. In this I worked closely with the profession to whom I will always be grateful. We did our best to see to it that rights were not inadvertently or unnecessarily compromised. The law should give protection to rights, not take them away, especially in Hong Kong, where structural democracy is still absent. The people relied on the law to protect them, and the courts are the ultimate arbiter of the law. We are mindful that when the court applies a law which takes away fundamental rights, the confidence in the courts and judicial independence is shaken, even though the fault lies in the law, not with the judge who applies it, and that would strike at the foundation of our rule of law.

Your honour, the importance of that duty was driven home to me by the words of a distinguished judge – Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy of the United States Supreme Court as he then was – when he came to Hong Kong at the invitation of the then Chief Justice Andrew Li to give a speech to the Judiciary and the legal profession on 8 February, 1999. He was deeply moved by the challenges lying ahead of us, and the important role of an independent Judiciary. He submitted: “One requisite for judicial independence is that judges have the jurisdiction, the right, and the official capacity to decide all matters, susceptible to judicial resolution, that are necessary to ensure liberty and human freedom. If a judiciary does not have jurisdiction to this extent, then the members of the bar and the members of the larger society must continue to press to expand the jurisdiction. This is vital, because if the bar and the society seem indifferent to a too-narrow judicial charter, there is a risk that the judiciary will in fact or perception aid and abet a larger scheme to deprive persons of their liberty.”

Those were strong words, your honour, but I recognized their authority, and I had ever taken them as marking the ultimate loyalty a barrister owes to judicial independence. Your honour knows that there is no disrespect, to say that the defence of judicial independence is not for the benefit of judges themselves, but so that they can be in a position fearlessly to uphold the rule of law.

The defence of the rule of law is a two-way street. I believed that the representative of the profession in LegCo has a duty also to listen, to consult and explain the law to the community: to alert people to their rights and obligations, to clarify what is obscure, to reduce bewilderment, to invite them to voice their concerns and point out errors, to address those concerns with sincerity, and represent them forcefully to the government; and where their needs cannot be addressed through the law, to work with them towards other solutions

One of the ways for me to keep in touch with the public was by writing articles to the local press, in plain language accessible to the general reader. For everyone ought to understand the law under which he lives. Throughout those years, and even up to now, I have never abandoned that exercise. Less frequently, I publish academic articles and contributions to academic forums, particularly on matters in need of law reform.

Your honour, working with the government in LegCo had impressed upon me, that the rule of law is not just about the law, but equally about governance. For laws are made for the “peace, order and good governance of Hong Kong”. Laws that protect rights tend to win the people’s trust in their government, and trust facilitates good governance. So elected representatives have the duty to speak up to the government of the day: to advise and counsel, to admonish and to warn, constantly: do our laws take rights seriously? The law is not perfect and lawyers know more than anyone else how imperfect the law is. So why should people respect and obey the law? There are, of course, many answers, but the answer I gave myself is this: we can ask people to obey the law if it is the best approximation to justice. Which implies that we are duty bound to listen to criticisms of the law, and make sincere efforts to make the law better, and correct mistakes as much as possible. Justice is the soul of the law without which the rule of law descends to the level of rule by force, even if it is force by majority.

In the course of this trial, your honour’s attention was drawn to a debate on the POO in LegCo on 21 December 2000. In that debate, I pointed out the defects existing in its provisions. They were defects which had long troubled the legal profession. I warned the government that we must seriously consider reform if we were to avoid the law being disobeyed in desperation. Someone in a panel discussion had raised the issue of civil disobedience and the Secretary for Security had called it a threat. But it need not be taken as a threat, but should act as warning or reminder. I urged the government not to shut out rational discussion for reform, because by its recalcitrance, the government was in danger of creating the very conditions which made civil disobedience inevitable and justifiable: something which none of us wished to see.

Those years in LegCo had repercussions for me for life because your honour, defending the rule of law means we ourselves must take rights seriously, and that is a lifelong endeavour.

There is no right so precious to the people of Hong Kong as the freedom of expression and the freedom of peaceful assembly. Not only is the freedom to speak the truth the core of human dignity, it is also the last safety valve in a democratic society, as remarked by our illustrious judges repeatedly. Respecting those rights is also part and parcel of defending the rule of law.

I had learned that the rule of law not only has to be defended in court, or in LegCo, but also in the streets and in the community. Your honour, I had spoken countless times in LegCo. But I also realize that it is not good enough for me to make speeches in beautiful words and measured dignity in the precincts of the Legislative Council, shielded by the privilege of absolute freedom of speech and debate, and immunity from legal action. When the people, in the last resort, had to give collective expression to their anguish and urge the government to respond, protected only by their expectation that the government will respect their rights, I must be prepared to stand with them, stand by them and stand up for them. Otherwise, all my pledges and promises would be just empty words.

Your honour, the Hong Kong people is a peace-loving and well-disciplined people. Their resolute self-restraint even in highly emotional situations has been proved time and again. In the critical hours of the handover between 30 June and 1 July 1997, the great event passed without a hitch. In the march of half a million on 1 July 2003, not a single pane of glass was broken. Even in 2019, when over 1 million marched on 9 June, and over 2 million marched on 16 June. The peace and good order of the massive crowds astonished and won the admiration of the world.

And in the incident of the present trial, this was demonstrated again. By the estimation of the organizers, over 1.7 million participated in the day’s event. But whatever the exact figure, the huge and dense crowds in and around the venue, the resolute patience with which the crowds waited in the pouring rain, were captured in undisputed footages preserved for all posterity. The number and the perseverance spoke volumes for the intensity of the feelings in the community, and yet the self-restraint was for all to see. It is not disputed even by the prosecution that the event was entirely peaceful and orderly, without any untoward event. The crowd had kept faith with the organizers who enjoined them to be ” peaceful, rational and non-violent”. At such times we cannot be seen to abandon the people but must stand side by side with them, in the hope that peace may prevail.

The positive effect of the peacefulness of that demonstration was acknowledged by the CE, Mrs Carrie Lam 2 days later, remarking that it would facilitate dialogue between government and the public. In the event, the dialogue on that occasion did not continue for long, but it was a step in the right direction. I believe we should nurture hope, and continue, as Justice Kennedy urged upon the legal profession gathered together in that distinguished company : You must speak reason to your litigants. You must speak justice to society. You must speak truth to power.

Your honour, I came late to the law. I have grown old in the service of the rule of law. I understand Sir Thomas More is the patron saint of the legal profession. He was tried for treason because he would not bend the law to the King’s will. His famous last words were well authenticated. I beg to slightly adapt and adopt them: I stand the law’s good servant but the people’s first. For the law must serve the people, not the people the law.

Your honour, please permit me to thank my counsel. Their tireless dedication and excellence have made me proud to be a member of the bar.

This is my statement. Thank you, your honour.
