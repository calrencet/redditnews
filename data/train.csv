0,How one restaurant’s experiment may help diners breathe safely,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/interactive/2021/indoor-air-quality-safety-experiment/?tid=a_classic-iphone&amp;no_nav=true,"The Post asked three indoor air experts to examine Sierra Mar’s layout, including the location of vents and air filters, and some of the results Hernandez has gathered. They generally agreed that the devices used, and principally the HEPA filters, are known to work, so the design is likely creating a safer indoor experience.

[How to assess the safety of indoor dining]

Nothing is perfectly safe, as Hernandez himself acknowledges. The aim is reducing risk, and Virginia Tech’s Marr said the system Hernandez and Freed devise will do that “substantially.”

“It relies on proven technologies: a combination of excellent ventilation and filtration,” she said. “Real-time monitoring that is publicly available provides valuable information to the public, giving people confidence that the space is indeed low risk.”

Portland State University’s Corsi added that mixing air together indoors is very important, on top of good air ventilation and filtration. The air purifiers are spaced out in part to help do this.

“When you do increase mixing in a space, that does break up that plume of concentrated aerosols between you and an infector,” Corsi said. “That additional mixing causes dispersion, which makes the receptor inhale a lot lower amounts of the infector’s respirable particles.”

Donald Milton, who studies indoor air at the University of Maryland and pushed health authorities early on to recognize the virus’s airborne transmission, also thought the system designed by Hernandez would make dining safer in general. But he drew a distinction between people eating at the same table — where the smaller cordless device, made by Wynd, pushes the air upward — and those who are further away.

“Maybe that system could protect you from the people you’re eating at the same table with. That’s a very challenging thing,” Milton said, noting a device sitting on a crowded tabletop is more likely to be bumped or shifted into the wrong direction.

“But by having good mixing, good filtration of the air in the restaurant generally, you will reduce exposure to people at other tables.”

Marr did note something that Hernandez has been careful about, but that could undermine others attempting the approach: You have to be very careful about where your air purifiers are located. You do not want them pulling air in such a way that you are actually “spreading aerosols between tables,” Marr cautions.

In other words, do not line up two tables and then a purifier, or the air from the farthest table will travel across the central table to the machine, coursing around those seated at the central table along the way. That is the kind of simple, but consequential, mistake that we will learn to avoid in this new world of still invisible, but now demystified, air.

After collecting his measurements at the restaurant, Hernandez shared the data with The Post. It showed the setup worked, he said.

In the north sector of the restaurant, even as occupancy increased to 18 diners, airborne levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) never rose above 2 micrograms per cubic meter. That is even though outdoor PM2.5 levels that evening were at around 10 micrograms per cubic meter.

Indoor carbon dioxide levels rose across the restaurant as the occupancy level increased, but never eclipsed 600 parts per million. Outdoor levels are generally around 400 parts per million.

That rise is not enough to be dangerous, Hernandez suggests, and is actually in a sense good news when compared with the particle findings, since tiny molecules of carbon dioxide gas fly right through filters.

“The gases go up but the particles don’t. That’s the result of an engineering control,” he said.

Hernandez, who has also implemented indoor air quality monitoring for a number of Colorado schools, argues that even once the current pandemic is over, the kind of design that he has created will remain in demand.

“It applies to the next pandemic, colds, flu, whooping cough, you name it,” he said.

For restaurant owner Mike Freed, he is just hoping that California health regulators, and other restaurants, pay attention.

“I don’t think this is rocket science,” says Freed, “which is why it’s mind-boggling to me that the public health officials aren’t talking to the building scientists.”",698,4273,9,62

A senior Japanese ruling party official said canceling this year’s Olympics in Tokyo remains an option if the coronavirus crisis becomes too dire, as a fourth wave of infections surges less than 100 days from the planned start of the Games.

“If it seems impossible to do it anymore, then we have to stop, decisively,” Toshihiro Nikai, secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party, said in comments to broadcaster TBS.

Cancellation is “of course” an option, Nikai said. “If the Olympics were to spread infection, then what are the Olympics for?” he added.

A key backer of Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, party heavyweight Nikai is known for his frank comments, which come as many other ruling party lawmakers have avoided discussing the hot button issue of a possible cancellation.

The world’s biggest sporting event has already been delayed by a year and is being held without international spectators.

Japan is grappling with rising coronavirus infections, with numbers trending higher in Tokyo after the government ended a state of emergency, and Osaka suffering a record number of cases.

The government is pushing ahead with preparations incorporating social distancing measures and other restrictions for the Games set to begin on July 23, with a scaled back torch relay underway.

“We’ll hold (the Games) in a way that’s feasible,” Taro Kono, a popular minister in charge of Japan’s vaccination drive, said on a separate TV program, according to Kyodo News. “That may be without spectators,” he added.

Little support

Polls indicate little support in Japan for holding the Games during a global pandemic. “Canceling Olympics” was trending on Twitter in Japan on Thursday with more than 35,000 tweets from users.

“If this person says it, Olympics cancellation looks like a reality,” tweeted @marumaru_clm in reference to Nikai.

Olympic organizers, Japan’s national Olympic committee and the Tokyo government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The comments from lawmakers come as health experts raise alarm at the spread of infection and strain it is placing on the medical system.

Japan’s top medical adviser, Shigeru Omi, acknowledged the pandemic had entered a fourth wave, driven by mutant strains, with Kyoto University professor Hiroshi Nishiura urging in a magazine commentary that the Olympics be postponed.

Akira Koike, an opposition lawmaker with the Japanese Communist Party, reacted to Nikai’s comments on Twitter saying holding the event is already “impossible” and a decision on cancellation should be made “quickly.”

Cancellation or postponing the Games would probably not hurt Japan’s economy much but would have a larger effect on Tokyo’s service sector, a senior International Monetary Fund official said on Wednesday.

0,Czechia expelled all Russian ambassadors due to the explosion of ammunition depots,https://praguemorning.cz/czech-republic-expels-18-russian-diplomats/,"The Czech Republic says it will expel 18 Russian diplomats, alleging that Russian intelligence officers – all those identified as SVR and GRU agents.

Prime Minister Andrej Babis said Saturday that the Czech intelligence agencies provided clear evidence about the involvement of Russian military agents in the explosion of 50 tonnes of munitions at a depot in Vrbětice in October 2014 in which two people died.

Czech police’s organised crime unit had worked on the case for several years in cooperation with the BIS counterintelligence service and the Brno Regional Public Prosecutor’s Office.

“The explosion led to huge material damage and posed a serious threat to the lives of many local people, but above all it killed two of our fellow citizens, fathers of families,” Babis said.

Babis added the Czech Republic is a sovereign state and must react to those findings.

Interior Minister Jan Hamacek, who is also serving as the foreign minister, said those 18 Russian embassy staffers were clearly identified as Russian military spies and were ordered to leave the country within 48 hours.

Hamacek said he had summoned Russian ambassador Alexander Zmeyevsky on Saturday evening to tell him about the decision.

In 2014, a series of blasts took place in the munitions depot at Vrbětice in south Moravia. Two people were killed.

The warehouses were leased by the Ostrava company Imex Group. Police are investigating the explosion as a deliberate general threat.

Česko vyhostí 18 zaměstnanců ruské ambasády. Existuje důvodné podezření ze zapojení důstojníků ruské tajné služby GRU do výbuchů muničních skladů ve Vrběticích. Oceňuji práci našich bezpečnostních složek, policie a zejména NCOZ na odhalení této bezprecedentní skandální akce. — Andrej Babiš (@AndrejBabis) April 17, 2021

Czech police officers simultaneously seek two Russian nationals who used passports registered to Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov. (While in the country, the men later switched to Moldovan passports under different names.)

The individuals’ photographs, shared online by the Czech police, indicate that the two wanted men are the same suspected Russian intelligence agents accused of trying to assassinate Sergey Skripal and his daughter in England in March 2018.

Following the attack in England, investigative journalists identified Petrov and Boshirov as aliases for Russian military intelligence officers named Alexander Mishkin and Anatoly Chepiga. The statement from the Czech police does not mention the attack against the Skripals.

That Russia placed ""bounties” on the heads of U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan was one of the most-discussed and consequential news stories of 2020. It was also, as it turns out, one of the most baseless — as the intelligence agencies who spread it through their media spokespeople now admit, largely because the tale has fulfilled and outlived its purpose.

The saga began on June 26, 2020, when The New York Times announced that unnamed “American intelligence officials” have concluded that “a Russian military intelligence unit secretly offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants for killing coalition forces in Afghanistan — including targeting American troops.” The paper called it “a significant and provocative escalation” by Russia. Though no evidence was ever presented to support the CIA's claims — neither in that original story nor in any reporting since — most U.S. media outlets blindly believed it and spent weeks if not longer treating it as proven, highly significant truth. Leading politicians from both parties similarly used this emotional storyline to advance multiple agendas.

The story appeared — coincidentally or otherwise — just weeks after President Trump announced his plan to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2020. Pro-war members of Congress from both parties and liberal hawks in corporate media spent weeks weaponizing this story to accuse Trump of appeasing Putin by leaving Afghanistan and being too scared to punish the Kremlin. Cable outlets and the op-ed pages of The New York Times and Washington Post endlessly discussed the grave implications of this Russian treachery and debated which severe retaliation was needed. “This is as bad as it gets,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Then-candidate Joe Biden said Trump's refusal to punish Russia and his casting doubt on the truth of the story was more proof that Trump's “entire presidency has been a gift to Putin,” while Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) demanded that, in response, the U.S. put Russians and Afghans “in body bags.”

What was missing from this media orgy of indignation and militaristic demands for retaliation was an iota of questioning of whether the story was, in fact, true. All they had was an anonymous leak from “intelligence officials” — which The New York Times on Thursday admitted came from the CIA — but that was all they needed. That is because the vast majority of the corporate sector of the press lives under one overarching rule:

When the CIA or related security state agencies tell American journalists to believe something, we obey unquestioningly, and as a result, whatever assertions are spread by these agencies, no matter how bereft of evidence or shielded by accountability-free anonymity, they instantly transform, in our government-worshipping worldview, into a proven fact — gospel — never to be questioned but only affirmed and then repeated and spread as far and wide as possible.

That has been the dynamic driving the relationship between the corporate press and the CIA for decades, throughout the Cold War and then into the post-9/11 War on Terror and invasion of Iraq. But it has become so much more extreme in the Trump era. As the CIA became one of the leading anti-Trump #Resistance factions — a key player in domestic politics to subvert the presidency of the 45th President regarded by media figures as a Hitler-type menace — the bond between the corporate press and the intelligence community deepened more than ever. It is not an exaggeration to call it a merger: so much so that a parade of former security state officials from the CIA, NSA, FBI, DHS and others was hired by these news outlets to deliver the news. The partnership was no longer clandestine but official, out in the open, and proud.

The first goal this story served was to weaponize it in the battle waged by pro-war House Democrats and their neocon GOP allies to stop Trump's withdrawal plan from Afghanistan. How, they began demanding upon publication of the CIA/NYT story, can we possibly leave Afghanistan when the Russians are trying to kill our troops? Would that not be a reckless abdication to the Kremlin of this country that we own, and would withdrawal not be a reward to Putin after we learned he was engaged in such dastardly plotting to kill our sons and daughters?

In late June, this alliance of pro-war House Democrats — funded overwhelmingly by military contractors — and the Liz-Cheney-led neocon wing announced amendments to the military budget authorization process that would defund Trump's efforts to withdraw troops from either Afghanistan or Germany (where they had been stationed for decades to defend Western Europe against a country, the Soviet Union, that ceased to exist decades ago). They instantly weaponized the NYT/CIA story as their primary argument.

The record-breaking $740 billion military budget was scheduled to be approved by the House Armed Services Committee in early July. In a joint statement with Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-TX) on June 29 — the day the NYT story appeared — Liz Cheney proclaimed that “we remain concerned about Russian activity in Afghanistan, including reports that they have targeted U.S. forces.” One of the Democrats’ most pro-war House members, Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), announced on July 1 (three days after the NYT story) his own amendment to block any troop withdrawal from Germany, citing “increasing Russian aggression.”

On July 1 and 2, the House Armed Services Committee held its hearings and votes — I watched all fourteen hours and reported on it in a series of articles and a 90-minute video report — and it not only approved this massive military budget but also both amendments to bar troop withdrawal. Over and over, the union of pro-war Democrats and Cheney-led neocon Republicans steamrolled the anti-war faction of left-wing and right-wing war opponents (led by Congressmembers Ro Khanna (D-CA), Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) and Matt Gaetz (R-FL)), and repeatedly used the Russia bounty story to justify continuation of the longest war in America's history. This little speech from Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA) was illustrative of how this CIA story was used all day:

The U.S. media was somehow more militaristic and blindly trusting about this CIA story than even this pro-war union of lawmakers. That the CIA’s leaked claim to The New York Times should even be questioned at all — given that it was leaked anonymously and was accompanied by exactly zero evidence — is not something that even crossed their journalistic minds.

These people who call themselves “journalists” do not view pronouncements from the U.S. security state as something that prompts skepticism let alone requires evidence before believing. The officials who run those agencies are their friends, partners and colleagues — those they most revere — and their every utterance is treated as Gospel. If — after watching them behave this way the last five years without pause — you think that is an exaggeration, watch this short video compilation produced by The Daily Caller to see for yourself how they instantly converted this CIA ""Russia bounty” leak into proven fact that nobody, least of all them, should question:

As usual, the media figure most loudly and dramatically enshrining the CIA leak about Russia as Proven Truth was the undisputed Queen of demented conspiracy theories, jingoistic rhetoric, and CIA propaganda: MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow.

Over and over, she devoted melodramatic segments to denouncing the unparalleled evil of Russian treachery in Afghanistan (because the U.S. would never pay bounties to kill Russian soldiers in Afghanistan), at no point pausing her histrionics for even a second or two to wonder whether evidence ought to be presented before telling the millions of #Resistance liberals who watch her show that she is vouching for the truth of this story.

Predictably, now that this CIA tale has served its purpose (namely, preventing Trump from leaving Afghanistan), and now that its enduring effects are impeding the Biden administration (which wants to leave Afghanistan and so needs to get rid of this story), the U.S. Government is now admitting that — surprise! — they had no convincing evidence for this story all along.

The Daily Beast on Thursday was the first to notice that “the Biden administration announced that U.S. intelligence only had ‘low to moderate’ confidence in the story after all.” The outlet added: “that means the intelligence agencies have found the story is, at best, unproven—and possibly untrue.” The Guardian also reported that “US intelligence agencies have only ‘low to moderate confidence’ in reports last year that Russian spies were offering Taliban militants in Afghanistan bounties for killing US soldiers.” NBC News went even further, citing Biden’s campaign attacks on Trump for failing to punish Putin for these bounties, and noting: “Such a definitive statement was questionable even then….They still have not found any evidence, a senior defense official said Thursday.”

The Daily Beast and NBC News, Apr. 16, 2021

What made this admission particularly bizarre — aside from rendering weeks of decrees from media figures and politicians humiliatingly reckless and baseless — is that the Biden administration continued to assert this claim as truth as recently as Thursday. When announcing new sanctions aimed at Moscow and diplomatic expulsions of Russian diplomats — primarily in response to allegations of Russian hacking — the White House said “it was responding to reports that Russia encouraged Taliban fighters to injure or kill coalition forces in Afghanistan.” The official White House announcement of the retaliation said explicitly that “the Administration is responding to the reports that Russia encouraged Taliban attacks against U.S. and coalition personnel in Afghanistan based on the best assessments from the Intelligence Community (IC)” — a claim for which the IC itself admits it has only “low to moderate confidence” is even true.

When asked about this glaring contradiction yesterday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki gave an answer that barely rose to the level of cogency, yet she clearly admitted the lack of evidentiary basis for this long-standing CIA/media tale:

That there is no evidence for this media-laundered CIA story is not something we learned only yesterday. It has been obvious for many months. In September, NBC News — as Maddow was in the midst of her performative sadness and indignation over the story on its cable network — noted:

Two months after top Pentagon officials vowed to get to the bottom of whether the Russian government bribed the Taliban to kill American service members, the commander of troops in the region says a detailed review of all available intelligence has not been able to corroborate the existence of such a program. ""It just has not been proved to a level of certainty that satisfies me,"" Gen. Frank McKenzie, commander of the U.S. Central Command, told NBC News. McKenzie oversees U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The U.S. continues to hunt for new information on the matter, he said. ""We continue to look for that evidence,"" the general said. ""I just haven't seen it yet.

That was what made the refusal to question this story all along so maddening. Not only was no evidence presented to support the CIA’s assertions — something that, by itself, should have prevented every real journalist from endorsing its truth — but commanders in Afghanistan were saying months ago they could not find convincing evidence for it. That is what The Daily Beast meant in Thursday’s report when it said “there were reasons to doubt the story from the start” — not just the lack of evidence but also that “the initial stories emphasize[d] its basis on detainee reporting” and “the bounties represented a qualitative shift in recent Russian engagements with Afghan insurgents.” NBC News on Thursday also said that “such a definitive statement was questionable even then.”

But these doubts were virtually non-existent in most media reports. Indeed, one of the New York Times reporters who broke the story publicly attacked me as a conspiracy theorist back in September when I cited that NBC News story about the lack of evidence while pointing out what a crucial role this uncorroborated story played in stopping troop withdrawal from Afghanistan and claiming Trump was beholden to Putin. And while The Daily Beast on Thursday said there were reasons to doubt the story from the start, that same outlet was one of the most vocal and aggressive in pushing the story as true:

Even worse, other media outlets — led by The Washington Post — purported to have “independently confirmed” the NYT/CIA tale of Russian bounties. Twice in the last year, I have written about this bizarre practice where media outlets purport to “independently confirm” one another's false stories by doing nothing more than going to the same anonymous sources who whisper to them the same things while providing no evidence. Yet they use this phrase “independent confirmation” to purposely imply that they obtained separate evidence corroborating the truth of the original story:

For months, pro-war members of both parties and leading members of the NYT/CNN/MSNBC media axis pushed a story — an inflammatory, dangerous one — based on nothing more than the say-so of anonymous CIA operatives. How can anyone do this who knows even the bare minimum about what this agency does and what its function is: to spread disinformation not just to foreign countries but the domestic population as well? It is both mystifying and toxic. But for people who call themselves “journalists” to repeat, over and over, evidence-free CIA claims, telling those who trust them to believe it, is nothing short of repulsive.

If you think that, upon learning yesterday's news, there was any self-reflection on the part of the media figures who spread this, or that they felt chastened about it in any way, you would be very, very wrong. In fact, not only did few if any admit error, but they did exactly the same thing on Thursday about a brand new evidence-free assertion from the U.S. Government concerning Russia: they mindlessly assumed it true and then stated it to millions of people as fact. They are not embarrassed to get caught spreading false CIA propaganda. They see their role, correctly, as doing exactly that.

On Thursday, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, run by Biden’s Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, issued a short Press Release about its targeting of Russian-Ukrainian political consultant, Konstantin Kilimnik, with new sanctions. One sentence of this press release asserted a claim that the Mueller investigation, after searching for eighteen months, never found: namely, that “Kilimnik provided the Russia intelligence services with sensitive information on polling and campaign strategy” that he received from then-Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort.

Is it true that Kilimnik passed this polling data to the Kremlin? Maybe. But there is no way for a rational person — let alone someone calling themselves a “journalist” — to conclude that it is true. Why? Because, like the CIA tale about Russian bounties — a claim they learned yesterday had no evidence — this is nothing more than a U.S. Government assertion that lacks any evidence.

Do you think journalists learned the lesson that they just had rubbed in their faces hours before about the foolishness of assuming official statements to be true with no evidence? Of course that is a rhetorical question: too many to count instantly proclaimed that this story was true without spending an ounce of mental energy to question if it was or apply any skepticism. Here’s Maddow’s MSNBC comrade showing how this is done:

Do you see what Hayes just did there? It is vital not to lose sight of how irresponsible and destructive this behavior is just because it is now so common. He saw a Press Release from a U.S. Government agency, read an assertion that it contained in one sentence, had no evidence that this assertion was true, but nonetheless “reported” it as if it were proven fact to millions of people in a predictably viral tweet.

Hayes was far from alone. I cannot count how many employees of corporate media outlets did the same: read the Treasury Department's Press Release and, without pausing for a second, proclaimed it to be true. Indeed, the two MSNBC hosts who follow Hayes's nightly news program explicitly described this evidence-free Press Release as ""confirmation”— confirmation!

MSNBC's Rachel Maddow and Lawrence O'Donnell celebrating an evidence-free Treasury Department Press Release as ""confirmation,” Apr. 15, 2021

Let's set aside the absurdity of treating this as some shocking revelation even if it were true. Just like the oozing historical ignorance of pretending that there would be something astonishing about Russians paying for the killing of U.S. troops in Afghanistan when the CIA just last week explicitly boasted of having done the same to Russian soldiers in Afghanistan, what is this Treasury Press Release supposed to prove that is so breathtaking and scandalous: that the Kremlin could not possibly have obtained polling data about the U.S. electorate had Manafort not provided it to them? That they never would have known that Wisconsin and Pennsylvania were swing states without an elaborate plot of collusion to learn this from the Trump campaign?

But the far more important point is the U.S. media's willingness — their subservient eagerness — to obediently treat U.S. government pronouncements as Truth. Just like with the Russia bounty story, where there were ample reasons to doubt it from the start, the same is true of this Treasury Press Release. To begin with, if this were such a smoking gun ""confirming” collusion, why did the Mueller investigation after eighteen months of highly aggressive subpoena-driven investigative activity not discover it?

Let's express this as clearly as it can be expressed. Any journalist who treats unverified stories from the CIA or other government agencies as true, without needing any evidence or applying any skepticism, is worthless. Actually, they are worse than worthless: they are toxic influences who deserve pure contempt. Every journalist knows that governments lie constantly and that it is a betrayal of their profession to serve as mindless mouthpieces for these security agencies: that is why they will vehemently deny they do this if you confront them with this accusation. They know it is a shameful thing to do.

But just look at what they are doing: exactly this. These are not journalists. They are obsequious spokespeople for the CIA and other official authorities. Even when they learn that they deceived millions of people by uncritically repeating a story that the CIA told them was true, they will — on the very same day that they learn they did this — do exactly the same thing, this time with a one-paragraph Treasury Department Press Release. These are agents of disinformation: state media. And when they speak, you should listen to them with the knowledge of what they really are, and treat them accordingly.",3125,19213,14,87

Dr. Arūnas Bubnys was nominated for the post on Wednesday by Viktorija Čmilytė-Nielsen, the Speaker of Lithuania’s parliament, the Seimas.

According to the biography of Bubnys on the LGGRTC’s website, the “most important trends of his work” focus upon “anti-Nazi resistance in Lithuania in 1941–1944, the Polish underground in Lithuania in WWII, and holocaust (sic) in Lithuania.”

However, experts on the slaughter of nearly 200,000 Jews in Lithuania — the overwhelming majority — during the Nazi Holocaust decried the appointment of Bubnys, charging him with glorifying the pro-German puppet regime that ruled following the Nazi invasion of 1941, as well as deliberately minimizing the role played by Lithuanian collaborators during the Holocaust.

“For years Dr. Bubnys has participated in the glorification of the outbreak of the Lithuanian Holocaust on 23 June 1941,” observed the website Defending History, which closely monitors the politically-charged environment around the study of the Holocaust in Lithuania and other eastern European countries.

In June 2020, Bubnys addressed a public meeting in which he effusively praised Jonas Noreika, a Lithuanian independence advocate and military general who participated in the mass murder of Jews in the summer of 1941, and Kazys Škirpa, a founder of the wartime-era Lithuanian Activist Front (LAF) whose writings advocated the ethnic cleansing of Lithuania’s Jewish citizens. The two men are among the many anti-Soviet, nationalist politicians of that period whose reputations have been rehabilitated by the Lithuanian government over the previous 20 years.

According to Defending History, Bubnys “has also glorified the Nazi puppet ‘provisional government’ of the summer of 1941, and has consistently downgraded local Holocaust collaboration while seeking wherever possible to blame the ‘Jewish police’ for the horrors of the Vilna, Kovno, and Shavl (Šiauliai) ghettos, in the period after the murder of the Jewish residents of all of the hundreds of smaller communities [in Lithuania] in the second half of 1941.”",389,2594,16,124

Ukraine’s foreign minister has accused Russia of flagrantly threatening Ukraine with destruction as fears continue to rise over a possible escalation of hostilities in the country’s conflict-stricken east.

Fighting has intensified in recent weeks in Ukraine’s Donetsk and Lugansk regions, where government forces have battled Russian-backed separatists since April 2014 after the rebels seized a swath of territory there.

Meanwhile, Russia has amassed tens of thousands of troops as well as tanks and artillery near the shared border in the region. Moscow has also mobilised troops in the annexed Black Sea region of Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in March 2014.

Addressing a news conference on Thursday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba condemned the Kremlin’s “aggravation of the security situation” and accused Russian pundits and officials of “openly threatening Ukraine with war and the destruction of Ukrainian statehood”.

“Moscow’s actions and statements [are] aimed at escalating military tensions and undermining diplomatic efforts to resolve the Russian-Ukrainian conflict,” he said.

Kuleba also warned Moscow against initiating any incursion into Ukraine, stating any intensification of the escalation in the Donbas region, of which Donetsk and Lugansk are a part, would have “very painful” consequences for Russia.

“The red line of Ukraine is the state border. If Russia crosses the red line, then it will have to suffer,” he said. “The world is on the side of Ukraine and international law.”

Baltic nations rally around Ukraine

Kuleba’s warning came as the foreign ministers of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia arrived in Ukraine on Thursday morning in a show of solidarity in the face of the Russian military buildup.

Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told reporters that “Ukraine will never be on its own”.

“We stand with you, we stand in solidarity,” he said.

Russia has previously said its troop movements pose no threat and are merely defensive. It has also stated the military units would remain in position as long as the Kremlin saw fit.

But the buildup has alarmed Ukraine’s allies, prompting calls from NATO for Russian President Vladimir Putin to order a pullback.

On Wednesday, NATO members Germany and the United States urged Moscow to reverse course and de-escalate the situation in the region.

A day earlier, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg urged Russia to end its “unjustified” military buildup.

While Kyiv has welcomed the shows of Western support, they fall short of Ukraine’s desire for full NATO membership – which Moscow opposes.

Moscow blames NATO, US

Moscow has refused to change tack, and this week blamed NATO and the US for turning Ukraine into a “powder keg” with increasing arms supplies to the country.

The Kremlin has repeatedly denied interfering in Donbas, but Ukraine and several Western countries have said separatist forces in the region have been armed, led, funded and aided by Russia.

On Tuesday, in the first public description of the military buildup, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said Moscow had moved two army and three paratrooper units to its western border as part of a large snap drill meant to test combat readiness and respond to what he called threatening military action by NATO.

Shoigu said on state television that the three-week exercise was due to wrap up in the next two weeks.

He also claimed NATO was deploying 40,000 troops and 15,000 pieces of military equipment near Russia’s borders, mainly in the Black Sea and the Baltic regions. NATO denies having made such plans.

Russia has previously accused NATO of destabilising Europe with its troop reinforcements in the Baltics and Poland since the annexation of Crimea, which came after an uprising that toppled former Kremlin-friendly Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.",621,3979,10,72

As such, our editorial board was saddened but unsurprised to see virtually all of the industry’s trade organizations fold under the pressure of a mere globe-spanning pandemic: E3, GDC, the Tokyo Game Show, and more gave in to the spineless alarmists who put public health over the importance of game expos. Ultimately, our hand was forced.

That’s why today, we are proud to announce The Onion Gamers Expo, a weeklong video game conference spanning October 5 to 9, unafraid to kick-start the resurgence in our global pandemic.

Staged in the lavishly appointed 750 million-square-foot Zweibel Convention Center in downtown Phnom Penh, Cambodia, the Onion Gamers Expo is a conference that refuses to let gamers go for a year without the vital resources of mind-blowing trailers and stunning gaming announcements. It answers lesser conference’s timid kowtowing to so-called “pandemic experts” with a full-throated clarion call: Video games are here, video games are important, and video games cannot be held back by the threat of a few hundred thousand measly moralities to a virulent respiratory virus.

With commitments from Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, Atari, and Coleco Industries, OGE is dedicated to the principle that humanity requires—nay, demands—video game conventions. Indeed, they are vital to our civilization’s very survival. Would the great empires of Rome and Greece have canceled their video game conference if threatened with a simple flu? No! Would the free citizens of the gaming world have stood for a year lacking such gatherings without making the streets run red with the blood of their feckless political leaders? Unquestionably.

You see, then, that we had no choice but to ignore pleading from three dozen medical experts and invest heavily in creating a video conference like none before it or after.

This conference—and its 10,000 vendors, 2,750 major publishers, 713 gaming icon-packed panels, and dozens of dedicated communal soup troughs—is dedicated to those who despaired going for all of 2020 without receiving a single piece of Ratchet & Clank swag. It exists to comfort the troubled minds of those who worried that they would never again see a flustered Ubisoft tech crew spend their entire stage time trying to get a hands-on demonstration of Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla working again after a game-ending glitch. It exists for the legions of gamers who would have rioted and pillaged all the great cities of the earth without artist stalls where they could clandestinely purchase a book of Spryo the Dragon erotica. In other words, it exists for you, reader.

Indeed, even as you read these words, millions are salivating to see the pandemic generation of gaming conferences up close and personal in a way those gutless buffoons at E3 were unwilling to give you. It’s an understandable reaction for any self-respecting gamers, and even more so for those perceptive few able to see past the absurdity that breathing is more important than video games. So, keep your eyes on our social media account to get your tickets, and visit the Onion Gamer Expo store for your official OGE merch. But hurry! We only have 1.5 million tickets left, and they’re sure to run out soon!

Suga made the request during telephone talks with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla on the last day of his three-day visit to Washington for a White House meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden.

Bourla was quoted by the officials as saying Pfizer would like to promote consultations about the request swiftly and coordinate closely with the Japanese government.

The talks came as Japan trails far behind Britain, the United States and elsewhere in providing vaccinations to people.

Japan relies solely on imported coronavirus vaccines, and Pfizer's vaccine is the only one the country has approved so far.

During the summit meeting on Friday, Suga and Biden agreed to work together to help ensure fair access to coronavirus vaccines for developing countries and facilitate the production of safe, effective, and affordable vaccines in the Indo-Pacific region, including by expanding their manufacturing capacity in India.

Japan only began inoculating about 36 million people aged 65 or older, about 29 percent of its population, on Monday after beginning its campaign with health care workers on Feb. 17.

Out of Japan's 4.8 million health care workers, about 1.1 million, or about 0.87 percent of the population, had received at least one dose as of April 9, according to the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry.

Seeing a recent spike in the number of infections, the Japanese government has decided to expand tougher COVID-19 restrictions next week to all three of the country's major metropolitan areas centering on Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya, less than a month after a state of emergency was lifted.",283,1790,43,295
0,Industry says Canada's 'toxic' label on plastic will scare off investment,https://www.plasticsnews.com/news/industry-says-canadas-toxic-label-plastic-will-scare-investment,"The plastics industry used an April 12 government hearing in Canada to strongly push back against a proposal to declare plastic products ""toxic"" under Canadian environmental laws, saying it would deter investment.

While the online hearing in Parliament saw lengthy debates around how best to tackle plastic waste, leaders of Canada's plastics trade association and the CEO of Husky Injection Molding Systems Ltd. said the tougher rules could put a brake on growth.

""We have largely become a flyover destination for chemistry sector investment … and the listing of all plastic manufactured items as toxic will exacerbate that,"" said Bob Masterson, president and CEO of the Chemistry Industry Association of Canada.

The industry was reacting to a broad plan from the Canadian government, first made in October, that would officially declare plastic a toxin regulated under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.

Other parts of the plan seek to ban single-use disposable products including retail bags, straws and cutlery, as well as make it a national priority to tackle plastic waste with recycled content standards and producer responsibility.

But it was the idea to list plastics under CEPA that seemed to generate the most pointed concern from industry at the hearing in front of the Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable Development.

Government officials say the CEPA label would give agencies more tools and authority to manage plastic along its life cycle.

But plastics executives say it will scare away funding that would drive future jobs and growth, including in making plastics more recyclable.

""The biggest economic impact that will arise from the proposed federal actions will be the effect on future investment opportunities,"" Masterson said. ""We think it sends a very negative signal to the global industry to list all plastic manufactured items as CEPA toxic. It sends a message that Canada's ambivalent at best, if not actually in opposition to, growth and investment in the sector.""

He told Parliament that the petrochemical sector in the United States has attracted $300 billion in investment in the last six years.

But Canada, with about 10 percent of the population of the U.S., has not attracted the $30 billion he said it should have.

""We've seen very little of that here and we should have seen more,"" Masterson said.

Elena Mantagaris, vice president of plastics for Ottawa-based CIAC, said smaller plastics processing or recycling companies are questioning what the federal listing and bans would do to their business plans.

In particular, she mentioned an unnamed Montreal plastic bag recycling firm that said a ban on bags would shift investment to the U.S.

""I think many of our members are questioning whether future investments in this country are feasible, whether it's in the recycling sector or just in the plastics production sector in general,"" she said, estimating that large-scale plastic product bans in Canada could cost at least 13,000 jobs and likely more.

Similarly, Husky President and CEO John Galt said he's aware of a PET packaging and recycling firm that's put investments on hold, and he argued that others are making similar calculations.

""Since this legislation has been [introduced], Husky and many of our customers and co-suppliers to the industry have put our investments in Canada on hold,"" Galt said. ""The right solution, in my opinion, is to engage our industry and its 1,700 small and medium-sized businesses in the solution. The development of the circular economy will create jobs.""

The Canadian plan has also drawn criticism from the U.S. industry. The Plastics Industry Association in Washington reiterated in response to the hearing that it sees the CEPA designation as a nontariff trade barrier that will disrupt $12 billion in cross-border trade in plastics.",613,3856,11,73

After last week’s $499 price reveal of the upcoming Xbox Series X, Playstation struck back, printing billions in counterfeit bills and flooding the market to cause hyperinflation, making the American d ollar completely worthless.

Hope you Xbox stans enjoy spending $400,000 on a can of Coke!

Gamers have been waiting with baited breath for Sony’s response to the Series X price, remembering gleefully that the company drew blood last generation by pricing the Playstation 4 at $100 less than the Xbox One. Thankfully, the machiavellian masterminds at Sony did not disappoint, with their gambit sending U.S. markets into a historic panic that has led to Americans carrying around wheelbarrows full of cash, begging retailers to take anything for food, and hoarding clean water and firearms. Sorry Microsoft, but you can’t make money if money doesn’t even mean anything anymore!

Xbox took a calculated risk by continuing to price their console at a premium, hoping the higher margins would cover the cost of new technology, but Sony did not miss a beat in flooding the American money market with cheap cash and phony currency, completely breaking down the very system Microsoft hoped to rely on. We’re guessing that far fewer gamers are going to be willing to barter for a Series X using sacks of potatoes and goats—the few products with tangible value now that the country’s markets have imploaded due to hyperinflation. If you’re a Sony fan, you gotta love the thought of getting one over on Microsoft like this, no matter how cold, hungry, and terrified you might be about the impending collapse of human society.



Still, you can never count out a console- maker like Microsoft until it’s over, especially in an epic rivalry like this. In fact, we’re already hearing reports that Microsoft execs have gathered a pile a sharpened sticks and started throwing stones at the windows of the Sony of America headquarters in order to tempt them into a hand -to-hand brawl to end their efforts at currency manipulation. All we can say for sure is the future looks bright, because when two tech giants like this clash, gamers win!",368,2206,20,139

""I had to do something to force myself away from the TV,"" said Pearson, 33, carefully laying rows of strawberry slices on the white-fudge-frosting-covered cake. ""All of those people. Those poor people. I don't know what else to do.""

Pearson, who had never before expressed feelings of patriotism in cake form, attributed the baking project to a loss of direction. Having already donated blood, mailed a check to the Red Cross, and sent a letter of thanks to the New York Fire Department, Pearson was aimlessly wandering from room to room in her apartment when the idea of creating the confectionery stars and stripes came to her.

""My friends Cassie and Patrick [Overstreet] invited me over to have dinner and just talk about, you know, everything,"" said Pearson, a Topeka legal secretary who has never visited and knows no one in either New York or Washington, D.C. ""I thought I'd make something special or do something out of respect for all of the people who died. All those innocent people. All those rescue workers who lost their lives.""

Mixing the cake and placing it in the oven shortly after 3 p.m., Pearson sat at the kitchen table and stared at the oven door until the timer rang 50 minutes later.

As the cake cooled, Pearson gathered materials to decorate it. She searched the spice cupboard for a half-used tube of blue food coloring, but could not find it. After frantically pulling all the cans and jars from the cupboard, she finally found the tube in the very back. Emitting a deep sigh of relief, she spread the coloring over the cake's upper-left-hand corner to create the flag's blue field.

""I baked a cake,"" said Pearson, shrugging her shoulders and forcing a smile as she unveiled the dessert in the Overstreet household later that evening. ""I made it into a flag.""

Pearson and the Overstreets stared at the cake in silence for nearly a minute, until Cassie hugged Pearson.

0,China opens its borders to billions of dollars of gold imports - sources,https://www.reuters.com/world/china/exclusive-china-opens-its-borders-billions-dollars-gold-imports-sources-2021-04-16/,"China has given domestic and international banks permission to import large amounts of gold into the country, five sources familiar with the matter said, potentially helping to support global gold prices after months of declines.

China is the world's biggest gold consumer, gobbling up hundreds of tonnes of the precious metal worth tens of billions of dollars each year, but its imports plunged as the coronavirus spread and local demand dried up.

With China's economy rebounding strongly since the second half of last year, demand for gold jewellery, bars and coins has recovered, driving domestic prices above global benchmark rates and making it profitable to import bullion. read more

The local premium is now about $7 to $9 an ounce, according to gold traders in Asia, and would probably have increased further if more imports to satisfy demand had not been allowed.

About 150 tonnes of gold worth $8.5 billion at current prices is likely to be shipped following the green light from Beijing, four sources said. Two said the gold would be shipped in April and two said it would arrive over April and May.

The bulk of China's gold imports typically comes from Australia, South Africa and Switzerland.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC), the country's central bank, controls how much gold enters China through a system of quotas given to commercial banks. It usually allows metal in but sometimes restricts flows.

""We had no quotas for a while. Now we are getting them ... the most since 2019,"" said a source at one of the banks moving gold into China.

The PBOC did not respond to a request for comment.

The size of the shipments signals China's dramatic return to the global bullion market. Since February 2020, the country has on average imported gold worth about $600 million a month, or roughly 10 tonnes, Chinese customs data show.

In 2019, its imports ran at about $3.5 billion a month, or roughly 75 tonnes.

China's absence made little difference to gold prices early in the pandemic when Western investors fearful of economic catastrophe stockpiled vast amounts of the safe-haven asset, pushing it to a record high of $2,072.50 an ounce.

But the investor interest drifted away as vaccines and government stimulus programmes revived economic growth and gold prices have sagged to around $1,750 an ounce.

India's demand for bullion has also rebounded from a pandemic-induced slump, with record-breaking imports in March of 160 tonnes of gold, an Indian government source told Reuters this month. read more

China and India typically account for some two fifths of the world's annual demand for gold.

Their recovery is ""critical in setting the floor for gold"" and should stop prices from falling further over the coming months, said Suki Cooper, an analyst at Standard Chartered.

Jewellery sales in China during the Lunar New Year holiday in February were stronger than in 2019 and 2020 and manufacturers and retailers needed to replenish their stocks, said Philip Klapwijk at Precious Metals Insights, a consultancy in Hong Kong.

""A pretty decent recovery in gold demand this year will require a generally much higher level of gold imports (than in 2020),"" he said.

Between new variants and vaccine risks, now is not a good time to be expecting.

“If it’s possible, delay pregnancy a little until a better moment,” Health Ministry official Raphael Parente said during a news conference on Friday, warning that the P1 variant of the coronavirus prevalent in Brazil “acts more aggressively in pregnant women.”

Brazil has become one of the world’s coronavirus epicenters lately, with 13.7 million cases of Covid-19 recorded and 365,000 fatalities, a death toll second only to the United States.

Also on rt.com Blood-clotting illness PVT 30x more prevalent in Moderna, Pfizer Covid-19 recipients than AstraZeneca – Oxford researchers

Doubly alarming is the high number of babies dying of Covid-19 in Brazil. Between 518 and 1,032 infants under a year old have died with the virus since last February, according to varying estimates collected by the BBC. The country’s overall high rate of infection has been blamed for these infant deaths.

The so-called P1 variant of the virus is believed to be responsible for the country’s surge in infections, which, public health institute Fiocruz states, has brought the country’s healthcare system closer to collapse than at any time in the country’s history. First identified in the Amazon city of Manaus, the variant is highly transmissible and more likely to affect younger people. Moreover, scientists claim that the variant is more resistant to vaccines and antibodies.

While the virus itself may put pregnant women at risk, so too may vaccines. Britain’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advised on Friday that pregnant women should choose vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna if possible, as more real-world safety data on these shots exists.

“There is no evidence to suggest that other vaccines are unsafe for pregnant women, but more research is needed,” the JCVI added. Previously, expectant mothers were advised to err on the side of caution and delay vaccination.

(Bloomberg) -- China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd.’s expansive pop-up showroom sits at the heart of Shanghai’s National Exhibition and Convention Center. With nine models on display, it’s hard to miss. The electric car upstart has one of the biggest booths at China’s 2021 Auto Show, which starts Monday, opposite storied German automaker BMW AG. Yet its bold presence belies an uncomfortable truth -- Evergrande hasn’t sold a single car under its own brand.China’s largest property developer has an array of investments outside of real estate, from soccer clubs to retirement villages. But it’s the recent entry into electric cars that’s captured investors’ imaginations. Shareholders have pushed Evergrande NEV’s Hong Kong-listed stock up more than 1,000% over the past 12 months, allowing it to raise billions of dollars in fresh capital. It now has a market value of $87 billion, greater than Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co.Such exuberance over an automaker that has repeatedly pushed back forecasts for when it will mass produce a car is emblematic of the froth that has been building in EVs over the past year, with investors plowing money into a rally that briefly made Elon Musk the world’s richest person and has some concerned about a bubble. Perhaps nowhere is that more evident than in China, home to the world’s biggest market for new energy cars, where a mind-boggling 400 EV manufacturers now jostle for consumers’ attention, led by a cabal of startups valued more than established auto players but which have yet to turn a profit.Evergrande NEV was a relatively late entrant to that scene.In March 2019, Hui Ka Yan, Evergrande’s chairman and one of China’s richest men, vowed to take on Musk and become the world’s biggest maker of EVs in three to five years. Tesla Inc.’s Model Y crossover had just had its global debut. In the two years since, Tesla has gained an enviable foothold in China, establishing its first factory outside the U.S. and delivering around 35,500 cars in March. Chinese rival Nio Inc. earlier this month reached a significant milestone when its 100,000th EV rolled off the production line, prompting Musk to tweet his congratulations.Despite his lofty ambitions and Evergrande NEV’s rich valuation, Hui has repeatedly pushed back car-production targets. The tycoon’s coterie of rich friends, among others, have stumped up billions, but making cars -- electric or otherwise -- is hard, and hugely capital intensive. Nio’s gross margins only flipped into positive territory in mid-2020, after years of heavy losses and a lifeline from a municipal government.Speaking on an earnings call in late March after Evergrande NEV’s full-year loss for 2020 widened by a yawning 67%, Hui said the company planned to begin trial production at the end of this year, delayed from an original timeline of last September. Deliveries aren’t expected to start until some time in 2022. Expectations for annual production capacity of 500,000 to 1 million EVs by March 2022 were also pushed back until 2025. Still, the company issued a buoyant new forecast: 5 million cars a year by 2035. For comparison, global giant Volkswagen AG delivered 3.85 million units in China in 2020.It’s not just Evergrande’s delayed production schedule that’s raising eyebrows. A closer look under the company’s hood reveals practices that have industry veterans scratching their heads: from making selling apartments part of car executives’ KPIs, to attempting a model lineup that would be ambitious for even the most established automaker.‘Weird Company’“It’s a weird company,” said Bill Russo, the founder and chief executive officer of advisory firm Automobility Ltd. in Shanghai. “They’ve poured a lot of money in that hasn’t really returned anything, plus they’re entering an industry in which they have very limited understanding. And I’m not sure they’ve got the technological edge of Nio or Xpeng,” he said, referring to the New York-listed Chinese EV makers already deploying intelligent features in their cars, like laser-based navigation.A closer look at Evergrande NEV’s operations reveals the extent of its unorthodox approach. While it’s established three production bases -- in Guangzhou, Tianjin in China’s north, and Shanghai -- the company doesn’t have a general car assembly line up and running. Equipment and machinery is still being adjusted, according to people who have seen inside the factories but don’t want to be identified discussing confidential matters.In a response to questions from Bloomberg, Evergrande NEV said it was preparing machinery for trial production, and would be able to make “one car a minute” once full production is reached.The company is targeting mass production and delivery next year of four models -- the Hengchi 5 and 6; the luxe Hengchi 1 (which will go up against Tesla’s Model S); and the Hengchi 3, according to people familiar with the matter. The company has told investors it aims to deliver 100,000 cars in 2022, one of the people said, roughly the number of units Nio, Xpeng Inc. and Li Auto Inc., the other U.S.-listed Chinese EV contender, delivered last year, combined.Its workers are also being asked to help sell real estate, the backbone of the Evergrande empire.New hires are required to undergo internal training and attend seminars that drill them on the company’s property history and have nothing to do with car making. In addition, employees from all departments, from production-line workers to back-office staff, are encouraged to promote the sale of apartments, whether through posting ads on social media or bringing relatives and friends along to sale centers to make them appear busy. Managerial-level staff even have their performance bonuses tied to such endeavors, people familiar with the measure said.Meanwhile, the ambitious targets have Evergrande NEV turning to outsourcing and skipping procedures seen as normal practice in the industry, people with knowledge of the situation say.While it’s hiring aggressively and recently scored Daniel Kirchert, a former BMW executive who co-founded EV startup Byton Ltd., the firm has contracted most of the design and R&D of its cars to overseas suppliers, some of the people said. Contracting out the majority of design and engineering work is an unusual approach for a company wanting to achieve such scale.14 Models At OnceOne of those companies is Canada’s Magna International Inc., which is leading the development of the Hengchi 1 and 3, one of the people said. Evergrande NEV has also teamed with Chinese tech giants Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Baidu Inc. to co-develop a software system for the Hengchi range. It will allow drivers to use a mobile app to instruct the car to drive via autopilot to a certain location and use artificial intelligence to switch on appliances at home while on the road, according to a statement last month.A spokesperson for Evergrande said it was working with international partners including Magna, EDAG Engineering Group AG and Austrian parts maker AVL List GmbH in developing “14 models simultaneously.” Representatives from Magna declined to comment. A Baidu spokesperson said the company had no further details to share, while a representative for Tencent said the software venture is with a related firm called Beijing Tinnove Technology Co. that operates independently. Tinnove didn’t respond to requests for comment.Rather than staggering model releases, Evergrande NEV appears to be rolling out every type of car all at once under its Hengchi brand, which sports a roaring gold lion on the badge and translates loosely to ‘unstoppable gallop.’ The nine models being launched span almost all major passenger vehicle segments from sedans to SUVS and multi-purpose vehicles. Prices will range from about 80,000 yuan ($12,000) to 600,000 yuan, although the final costs could change, a person familiar said.That’s a completely different product development strategy to EV pioneers like Tesla, which only has four models on offer. Nio and Xpeng have also chosen to focus on just a handful of marques, and even then are struggling to break into the black.“The market has proved the effectiveness of the ‘one product in vogue at one time’ strategy,” said Zhang Xiang, an automobile industry researcher at the North China University of Technology. “Evergrande is offering many products and expects a win. There’s a question mark over whether this will work.”Without any long-term carmaking nous, Evergrande has issued uncompromising directives to meet its latest production targets, according to the people. Two models, including the Hengchi 5, a compact SUV that rivals Xpeng’s G3, are targeting mass production in a little over 20 months. To hit that timing, certain industry procedures, like making mule cars, or testbed vehicles equipped with prototype components that require evaluation, may be skipped, people familiar with the situation said. Evergrande told Bloomberg it has entered a “sprint stage toward mass production.”As it is, Bloomberg could only find one instance where the Hengchi 5 has been showcased in public, in photos and grainy footage released by Evergrande in February as the cars drove around a snow-covered field in Inner Mongolia. The company’s shares surged to a record.Glossing over those steps is unusual, said Zhong Shi, a former automotive project manager turned independent analyst.“There’s a standard engineering process of product development, validation and verification, which includes several laboratory and road tests” in China and everywhere else, Zhong said. “It’s hard to compress that to shorter than three years.”While there’s no suggestion Evergrande’s approach violates any regulations, its stock-market run could be in for a reality check. After similarly hefty market gains, some EV startups in the U.S. that have yet to prove their viability as revenue-generating, profitable entities have lost their shine over the past few months amid concern about valuations and as established carmakers like VW move faster into EV fray.Read more: The End of Tesla’s Dominance May Be Closer Than It AppearsThe industry’s multi-billion dollar surge also hasn’t escaped Beijing’s attention. Evergrande NEV shares dipped lower last month after an editorial from the state-run Xinhua news agency highlighted concerns about how the EV sector is evolving. Of particular worry are companies that are shirking their responsibility to build quality cars, a blind race by local governments to attract EV projects, and high valuations by companies that have yet to deliver a single mass-produced car, according to the missive, which named Evergrande specifically in that regard. “The huge gap between production capacity and market value shows there is hype in the NEV market,” it said.Still, Evergrande NEV’s stock has gained 18% since then, buoyed by the outlook for China’s electric-car market. EVs currently account for about 5% of China’s annual car sales, BloombergNEF data show, with demand forecast to soar as the market matures and electric-car prices fall. EV sales in China may climb more than 50% this year alone, research firm Canalys said in a February report.With competition also on the rise, some outside Evergrande NEV’s loyal shareholder base remain skeptical.“The market is getting crowded but unless you have a preferred lane, there’s not much chance to win,” Automobility’s Russo said. “Maybe there’s some synergy with the property businesses but right now it’s an EV story, and a pretty expensive one.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",1844,11696,15,66
0,Gnome limits: UK garden centres run out after Suez blockage,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/apr/16/garden-gnomes-running-out-in-uk-as-garden-centres-business-booms,"Garden gnomes and other outdoor furniture are running out due to supply chain issues and the popularity of garden centres in the UK during lockdown.



Raw materials have become increasingly difficult to come by and the recent blockage of the Suez canal has also contributed to the national shortage of gnomes.

Ian Byrne, assistant manager of Highfield Garden World in Whitminster, Gloucestershire, said there had been a “massive upswing” in the sales of garden gnomes. “We haven’t seen a gnome in six months now, unfortunately,” he said.

Byrne said garden centres had experienced a “boom” and that was causing issues with the availability of many popular items.

He said: “There aren’t any [gnomes]. There’s definitely a shortage. It’s a combined thing with garden centres being so busy. I looked at some figures based on March which said garden centres were 97% busier than they were in 2019.

“Every day has been like a bank holiday. That’s good but it’s definitely causing some issues because it’s not just English garden centres that are booming, it’s all across Europe, so it’s causing issues with supply,” he said.

Like many garden centres, Byrne has been contacting suppliers across Europe and China to help ship garden gnomes to the UK.

He said: “Raw materials are becoming a bit of an issue and unfortunately gnomes are a victim of that shortage … Gnomes of any type – plastic, stone or concrete – are in short supply. They’ve been very popular over the last couple of seasons, we’ve seen a massive upswing in the sales of gnomes and definitely a different clientele wanting gnomes too.”



The Garden Centre Association’s chief executive, Iain Wylie, added: “Most garden centres haven’t noticed – although they will. We’re facing a perfect storm of lockdown, everyone being stuck at home, and one thing people can do is their gardening.”

Higher demand and confidence in supply chains have also caused issues. Plants, according to Wylie, have to be grown for a “just-in-time” market. “We are not immune to a ship getting stuck in a canal, freight cost issues due to Brexit, or the pandemic,” he said.



In the final three months of 2020, sales in DIY stores were up by 35% while garden centre sales were up by 8.5%, according to the Office for National Statistics.",395,2358,10,59
0,Energy planning: Israel looks to reduce gas emissions by 80% by 2050,https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/energy-planning-israel-looks-to-reduce-gas-emissions-by-80-percent-by-2050-665517,"Israel will look to reduce greenhouse -gas emissions by 80% by 2050 as part of its long-term plan to reduce pollution , the Energy Ministry said Sunday.

In addition, Israel has committed to close all coal plants by 2025, which would represent the fastest pace of coal reduction in the world, Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said in a presentation to journalists. The ministry’s new long-term strategic plan is the first of its sort for Israel with emission reduction targets and a road map of milestones and constraints in reaching its targets.

The long-term plan also aims to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions in the electricity sector by 75% to 85% by 2050, as well as improve its energy intensity index (energy consumption per unit of product) by 1.3% per year.

These targets are twice as ambitious as the commitments made by Israel at the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, something made possible by technological improvements since then, Steinitz said.

The strategic plan builds on new global trends such as hydrogen and natural-gas usage and the use of digital and smart grids, while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to frequent technological changes that happen in the energy sector, he said. In developing the plan, the Energy Ministry simulated about 2,000 possible scenarios for achieving the targets, it said.

The strategic plan takes into account Israel’s growing population density, which is among the highest in the world, with an increase in demand for electricity of about 2.8% per year. Other factors affecting Israel’s plan include the country’s large natural-gas reserves, the lack of available space to build solar-power fields, a lack of other renewable energy sources such as wind or hydroelectricity and Israel’s strength of innovation.

Among the strategic principles underlying the plan are: the need to transition to solar energy, with its massive storage needs; upgrading Israel’s electricity network with sustainable planning; transforming the way households use electricity (including replacing the use of cooking gas with the use of electricity); adoption of electric vehicles; continued investment in innovation; and adapting the natural-gas system to connect with Israel’s neighbors.

“We have set goals that are flexible, and we have not committed to using individual technologies,” Steinitz said. “We are looking ahead 30 years into the future, and we have no way of knowing how technology will advance by then. Imagine if we would have designed a technology plan 10 years ago. It would barely have taken natural gas into account.”",420,2873,12,68
1,Pop Culture Expert Surprisingly Not Ashamed Of Self,https://local.theonion.com/pop-culture-expert-surprisingly-not-ashamed-of-self-1819571922,"Shelham, who is somehow not nauseous with remorse and embarrassment, in her cubicle.

LOS ANGELES—According to reports, 29-year-old online commentator Caroline Shelham is somehow not completely ashamed of her own well-established identity as a ""pop culture expert.""

Shelham, who spends 10 hours every day consuming news updates on various entertainers and then commenting on their activities on an entertainment website, has reportedly shown no signs of humiliation or self-hatred over the way she spends the bulk of her time, and is also apparently not disgusted by the fact that this is actually what she does with her life.

""Basically, I like to look at what's going on in pop culture and comment on it with a sort of fresh, wry voice,"" said Shelham, who by all accounts still possesses the ability to look at herself in the mirror every morning. ""I try to find things that I think are really lame and vacuous and then just tear them apart.""

""I guess I see my role as being like an arbiter of what sucks and what doesn't in the world of show biz,"" added Shelham, seemingly under the sad impression that her work or existence has a meaningful use to society or the human race. ""Somebody's got to do it.""

According to Shelham, this week alone she has penned what she refers to with a straight face as ""news stories"" about the separation of actors Courteney Cox and David Arquette; a photograph of the singer Rihanna wearing a new outfit; and an advertisement for an upcoming episode of a television sitcom, all of which she was surprisingly willing to take credit for having written and disseminated.

She also composed a scathing, 800-word critique of the upcoming motion picture Burlesque that she suggested, with actual pride, was ""some of [her] best work.""

""I'm sorry, but it might be just about time for [Burlesque actress] Cher to go away now,"" wrote Shelham, who does not seem to find anything self-degrading in the fact that she earns a living by deriding people she does not, nor will ever, know. ""I know you're doing your best to make us forget that we actually found you charming in Moonstruck, but let's just call it a day already, shall we?""

Shelham—the daughter of a small business owner and a retired nurse who paid for her to attend a liberal arts college—recently spent a large portion of what in her mind is somehow a day's work creating an itemized list entitled ""10 Things I Hate About This Season Of Dancing With The Stars"" that she accepted money for writing and allowed to be published without apologizing to her loved ones for the despicable action.

She was also among the first to find out that Ian Ziering is expecting a baby—a fact that she remains inexplicably proud of having learned nearly 14 hours before the general public.

""Why in the name of God would anybody even pay attention to Jessica Simpson anymore?"" she recently asked without any sudden pangs of overwhelming regret or self-loathing. ""I think it's high time somebody told her that nobody cares.""

Though Shelham is an actual human being, her choice to intentionally put effort toward commenting on actor Kelsey Grammer's love life and the televised interactions of a group of New Jersey twentysomethings has evidently not caused her to contemplate the act of suicide.

The website features on its Home Page a video message from Ghislaine's brother Ian, filmed in response to the court's recent rejection of her third bail application, detailing the ""cruel and unusual"" conditions of her detention and confirming her decision to appeal this latest ruling.

Visitors will find biographical information, interviews and articles, as well as answers to frequently asked questions, legal resources, and links to important bail reform initiatives. The site also details the punishing regime Ghislaine is being subjected to during her extraordinary pre-trial detention

""Because of the continuing misinformation, misrepresentation and mischief in much of the media, Ghislaine's family started this website, an important resource for the public,"" said David Oscar Markus, an attorney for the family and Ms. Maxwell. ""Ghislaine is innocent and her treatment by the press and the prison is unconscionable.""

Ghislaine is currently a pre-trial detainee at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York facing allegations by anonymous accusers that date back 25 years. She has been held in this American prison in effective solitary confinement without bail for 280 days and counting, locked in a six-foot by nine-foot cell sometimes for 12 hours a day. She has a light shone in her face every 15 minutes during the night and endures multiple privations that are impacting her health and ability to properly prepare her defense and all this in the middle of the pandemic.

Like anyone else, she has the right to be presumed innocent, a constitutional right which is fundamental to the fairness of the American system of justice.

Ghislaine is a wife, a stepmother, a friend to many and a sister to a family that loves her very much. They believe in her innocence and that she will be exonerated at trial.

Pending the opportunity for Ghislaine to be able to defend herself in a court of law, RealGhislaine.com will be updated frequently with exclusive content, news, commentary and useful resources to help visitors form a more balanced view about the real Ghislaine Maxwell. Members of the news media and anyone else interested in following her status are encouraged to register for email updates.

The French National Assembly on Saturday approved the creation of an ""ecocide"" offence as part of a battery of measures aimed at protecting the environment and tackling climate change.

Advertising Read more

The ecocide measure was passed by 44 votes to 10 in France's lower house of parliament and will, if it becomes law, apply to ""the most serious cases of environmental damage at national level"", said Environment Minister Barbara Pompili.

Transgressors will be liable to up to 10 years in prison and a fine of 4.5 million euros ($5.4 million).

Pompili stressed that the draft bill is aimed at national events, such as the pollution of a French river.

""When we think of the attacks on the Amazon rainforest, that is not something we can tackle within our own laws,"" she said.

The aim is to strengthen the sanctions available to deal with ""serious and durable"" cases of intentional pollution of water, air or soil.

Some right-wing MPs complained about moves towards ""punitive ecology. Julien Aubert of the Republicans voiced the ""serious concerns"" of companies facing ""legal insecurity"" created by such environmental justice measures.

MPs on the left judged the offence being debated insufficient to tackle the problem, highlighting that it will only apply in cases of intentional pollution and not to problems caused by negligence or recklessness.

Some opposition members complained that the very term ""ecocide"" was an ""abuse of language"", preferring a more straightforward offence of ""attacking the environment"".

The Assembly also gave the green light to an offence of endangering the environment, on the model of endangering life, punishable by three years in prison and a 300,000 euro fine. The amount of a whole series of fines provided for by articles of the Environmental Code may also go up to 100,000 euros.

The entire draft bill will go to the Assembly for a vote next month before heading to the upper house Senate.

0,Belarus Lawmakers Approve Second Reading Of Draconian Bills To Limit Freedoms,https://www.rferl.org/a/belarus-lawmakers-approve-second-reading-of-draconian-bills-to-limit-freedoms/31207699.html,"MINSK -- Belarusian lawmakers have approved a second reading of several amendments to legislation severely restricting civil rights and the free flow of information amid a crackdown on the country’s pro-democracy movement.

The bills approved by members of the lower house on April 16 define a broad range of activities as “extremist,” providing additional ammunition for authorities to use draconian tactics to target and intimidate protesters and opposition forces challenging the official results of a presidential election last year that handed authoritarian ruler Alyaksandr Lukashenka his sixth consecutive term.

In the wake of the election, thousands of Belarusians have taken to the streets in what has become the largest and most-persistent show of opposition to Lukashenka. More than 33,000 people have been arrested in a crackdown that has left much of the opposition leadership in exile or prison. The European Union, the United States, and other nations have refused to recognize the declared election results and slapped sanctions on Lukashenka and other senior Belarusian officials.

The new amendments are likely to spark an outcry for further action.

According to the amendments, any activities by individuals, political parties, or domestic or international organizations defined as undermining independence, sovereignty, the constitutional order, and public safety will be considered as ""extremist.""

Crisis In Belarus Read our coverage as Belarusians continue to demand the resignation of Alyaksandr Lukashenka amid a brutal crackdown on protesters. The West refuses to recognize him as the country's legitimate leader after an August 9 election considered fraudulent.

If approved and signed into law, the amendments would ban lawyers from defending people in some criminal and administrative cases. Most of the lawyers who worked with the Belarusian Association of Journalists and have defended RFE/RL reporters in recent months have already been stripped of their licenses.

The proposed changes also say that the following actions will be considered as extremist activities: the distribution of false information; insulting an official; discrediting the state; impeding activities of the Central Election Commission and other state organs; and participating in or organizing unauthorized mass protests.

One passage of the amendments says that any materials promoting unsanctioned public events that can be read, sung, or shown will be considered as ""extremist symbols."" That includes portraits of anyone who was legally found to be an extremist.

In other parts, amendments to the law on media will allow authorities to shut down media outlets after they receive warnings if their activities pose a ""threat to the country's national security.""

The amendments also expand the ability of authorities to limit access to online publications if they carry information banned for distribution and refuse to follow requests by officials to address violations.

Lawmakers also approved in a second reading of amendments to the Criminal Code. Among other things, the changes would toughen punishment for disobeying, threatening, and assaulting law enforcement.

Another amendment would prohibit live coverage of unsanctioned protests, making journalists a target for attending such events.

Amendments to other existing laws dealing with extremism would give law enforcement officers the right to use firearms at their own discretion without waiting for a command from supervisors. Police would also be given the right to create lists of individuals they feel are inclined to participate in extremist activities.

Once on such a list, a person would be banned from some activities, including journalism, publishing, and teaching, while their financial activities would be put under surveillance. The amendments allow the central bank to monitor cash withdrawals through foreign-issued debit cards and limit such withdrawals, as well as to freeze the bank accounts of ""suspicious individuals.""

Jason Walls is a political reporter for the New Zealand Herald

New Zealand will donate more than 1.6 million Covid-19 doses through an international vaccine sharing programme, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has revealed.

This is enough to vaccinate 800,000 people – many of whom will be health workers and vulnerable people in the Pacific.

She made the announcement at the Gavi Covax event this morning (NZ time), where she was the first world leader to make a pledge.

""In New Zealand, we have been tackling Covid-19 collectively, as the team of 5 million,"" she said in a pre-prepared video.

""Now we need to act globally as the team of 7.8 billion.""

There are few other details at this stage – media were given a link to her video and a number of key points just before 5pm today.

But in early March, Ardern and Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said any surplus vaccines New Zealand had would be donated ""across our wider portfolio to the Pacific and developing countries worldwide"".

""We are committed to ensuring that any doses not needed here are put to good use elsewhere,"" Hipkins said at the time.

In her video, Ardern said: ""We welcome efforts to provide more doses of the vaccine to developing countries.""

She said as an international community, ""we need to do all we can to increase the supply of vaccines"".

She said sharing doses was one way this could help.

New Zealand had already donated $17 million to Covax and the 1.6 million doses were fully funded, she confirmed.

A number of other world leaders also made vaccines pledges at the event.

The Netherlands' Minister for Foreign Trade Sigrid Kaag said vaccines were an essential investment to overcome the pandemic.

""We must upscale the availability of vaccines worldwide, ensure that they reach the most vulnerable and that health systems are strong enough.

The Netherlands donated an extra €40 million ($67m) to Covax AMC, in addition to the €52 million already donated.",341,2030,14,84

The country has been in an uproar since the military seized power from civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi on February 1, triggering a massive uprising that the junta has sought to quell using lethal force.

But the movement remains undeterred, and protesters have continued taking to the streets this week – refusing to celebrate the Myanmar New Year holiday of Thingyan.

On Thursday in Myanmar’s second-largest city of Mandalay, a demonstration by medical workers turned violent when soldiers opened fire on them, sending them running to the mosque.

“They were shooting everywhere … they were targeting the Sule mosque compound because people in there were hiding protesters,” said an eyewitness.

A 30-year-old man who lived in the compound was shot dead, and at least two others were injured, said a doctor who treated the wounded.

“The man who died was shot from the back and it penetrated through his chest,” he said.

A medic who participated in the protest said he saw the arrest of six nurses and doctors during the crackdown.

“We lost contact with some medical team members as well,” he said.

Myanmar’s healthcare workers have been at the forefront of a nationwide civil disobedience movement, refusing to return to work under a military regime – which has left the country’s hospitals unstaffed during a pandemic.

Civil servants from other sectors have followed suit, bringing the operation of the country’s banks, schools, railway operations and businesses to a halt.

The junta has tried to force people back to work, and on Thursday, state-run media reported that at least 20 doctors participating in the movement will be charged for attempting to “deteriorate peace and stability.”

So far more than 700 civilians have been killed in anti-coup unrest, according to a local monitoring group, and more than 3,000 have been detained.

A well-known protest leader was arrested Thursday in central Monywa city – he was leading a demonstration by motorbike when a car rammed into him.

“Wai Moe Naing was arrested … I saw his motorcycle hit by the car from afar,” said fellow activist Hein Zaw Win.

The leader had grown in prominence since the coup, shepherding the movement in the remote Sagaing region despite multiple lethal crackdowns from authorities.

FILE PHOTO: Chimneys of a coal-fired power plant are pictured in New Delhi, India, July 20, 2017. REUTERS/Adnan Abidi/File Photo

Coal’s contribution to electricity generation in India fell for the second straight year in 2020, marking a departure from decades of growth in coal-fired power. Still, the fuel accounts for nearly three-fourths of India’s annual power output.

Environmental activists have long rallied against India adding new coal-fired capacity. Solar and wind energy prices are falling to record lows, which would help the world’s third-largest greenhouse gas emitter cut emissions.

U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry this month said India was “getting the job done on climate, pushing the curve,” as he began talks with government leaders aimed at cutting carbon emissions faster to slow global warming.

But a 28-page February draft of the National Electricity Policy (NEP) 2021 - which has not been made public - showed India may add new coal-fired capacity, though it recommended tighter technology standards to reduce pollution.

“While India is committed to add more capacity through non-fossil sources of generation, coal-based generation capacity may still be required to be added in the country as it continues to be the cheapest source of generation,” the NEP draft read.

All future coal-based plants should only deploy so-called “ultra super critical” less polluting technologies “or other more efficient technology”, it added.

State-run NTPC Ltd, India’s top electricity producer, said in September it will not acquire land for new coal-fired projects. Private firms and many run by states across the country have not invested in new coal-fired plants for years saying they were not economically viable.

A source with direct knowledge said a government panel of various power sector experts and officials will discuss the draft and could make changes before seeking cabinet approval.

India’s power ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday.

The draft document also proposed trade of renewable energy in day-ahead markets, creating separate tariffs for electric vehicle charging stations and privatizing electricity distribution companies.

ALTERNATE POWER SOURCES

The NEP 2021 is India’s first attempt at revising its electricity policy enacted in 2005, when the country produced negligible renewable energy.

Experts say phasing in renewable energy sources and phasing out conventional sources such as coal and natural gas rapidly could lead to instability in the electricity grid, potentially causing blackouts.

While suggesting flexible use of coal-fired and natural gas-fired power to ensure grid stability in the coming years, the draft policy lists promoting clean power as its primary objective.

The policy draft suggested expediting adoption of “cost effective” pumped hydro storage to support the electricity grid, adding that only 4.8 gigawatts (GW) of a potential 96.5 GW of pumped storage capacity has been developed so far.

The policy also recommends compensating natural gas-fired plants for operating at reduced efficiency to ensure grid stability, and for suffering higher wear and tear due to fluctuations in generation.",522,3462,13,70

1,Ornithologists Attribute Owls’ Nocturnal Lifestyle To Hard Cocaine Habit,https://www.theonion.com/ornithologists-attribute-owls-nocturnal-lifestyle-to-h-1844363607,"BRUNSWICK, ME—Dispelling commonly held beliefs surrounding their unusual sleep habits, ornithologists at Bowdoin College released a groundbreaking new study Monday that attributed owls’ nocturnal lifestyle to their hard cocaine habit. “The reason owls are so alert at night is because they have a crippling addiction to cocaine, which causes them to stay yipped up into the wee hours before they completely crash at dawn,” said lead researcher Nathaniel Wheelwright, explaining how the species’ darting head movements and dilated pupils were caused by snorting numerous lines over the course of an evening with their owl buddies. “After ripping a bunch of rails in remote tree branches or darkened corners of barns, these tweaked-out birds of prey will stay up all night repeatedly making and remaking their nests. We have also discovered that owls swallow their prey whole because the drug significantly reduces their appetite.” Wheelwright added that bats’ nocturnal lifestyle, on the other hand, could be attributed to their penchant for methamphetamines.",161,1058,9,72

HAVANA — Raul Castro said Friday he is resigning as head of Cuba's Communist Party, ending an era of formal leadership by he and his brother Fidel Castro that began with the 1959 revolution.

The 89-year-old Castro made the announcement Friday in a speech at the opening of the Eighth congress of the ruling party, the only one allowed on the island.

He said he was retiring with the sense of having ""fulfilled his mission and confident in the future of the fatherland.""

Castro didn't say who he would endorse as his successor as first secretary of the Communist Party. But he previously indicated that he favors yielding control to 60-year-old Miguel Diaz-Canel, who succeeded him as president in 2018 and is the standard bearer of a younger generation of loyalists who have been pushing an economic opening without touching Cuba's one-party system.

His retirement means that for the first time in more than six decades Cubans won't have a Castro formally guilding their affairs, and it comes at a difficult time, with many on the island anxious about what lies ahead.

The coronavirus pandemic, painful financial reforms and restrictions imposed by the Trump administration have battered the economy, which shrank 11% last year as a result of a collapse in tourism and remittances. Long food lines and shortages have brought back echoes of the ""special period"" that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s.

Discontent has been fueled by the spread of the internet and growing inequality.

Much of the debate inside Cuba is focused on the pace of reform, with many complaining that the so-called ""historic generation"" represented by Castro has been too slow to open the economy.

In January, Diaz-Canel finally pulled the trigger on a plan approved two congresses ago to unify the island's dual currency system, giving rise to fears of inflation. He also threw the doors open to a broader range of private enterprise — a category long banned or tightly restricted — permitting Cubans to legally operate many sorts of self-run businesses from their homes.

This year's congress is expected to focus on unfinished reforms to overhaul state-run enterprises, attract foreign investment and provide more legal protection to private business activities.

The Communist Party is made up of 700,000 activists and is tasked in Cuba's constitution with directing the affairs of the nation and society.

Fidel Castro, who led the revolution that drove dictator Fulgencio Batista from power in 1959, formally became head of the party in 1965, about four years after officially embracing socialism.

He quickly absorbed the old party under his control and was the country's unquestioned leader until falling ill inh 2006 and in 2008 handing over the presidency to his younger brother Raul, who had fought alongside him during the revolution.

Raul succeeded him as head of the party in 2011. Fidel Castro died in 2016.",483,2949,13,83
0,How China attempts to control the narrative on Xinjiang,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/16/china/beijing-xinjiang-uyghurs-propaganda-intl-hnk-dst/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN) China's Foreign Ministry this month issued the most forceful defense of its policies in Xinjiang to date, calling allegations of ""genocide"" in the region the ""lie of the century.""

The statement -- made in response to ongoing calls for a possible boycott of the 2022 Beijing Olympics -- represents the culmination of a long evolution of China's official narrative regarding its treatment of Uyghurs.

This evolving strategy, from outright denial to hardened public defense, is closely tied to the Chinese government's own increased sense of confidence on the world stage, and its willingness to confront its critics in the West head on, be it over Xinjiang, the South China Sea or Hong Kong, a CNN analysis shows.

In recent months, Xinjiang has become something of a patriotic litmus test, in which those wishing to do business with China must pick a side -- either stand with Beijing in implicit defense of its policies, or face the consequences.

The propaganda campaign has also reached a fever pitch, with state media reporters dispatched to Xinjiang to supposedly ""prove"" there is no oppression there, a ""La La Land""-inspired musical released to make Beijing's case, while critics overseas have faced sanctions and harassment.

While China has always maintained a sophisticated propaganda apparatus at home, its recent campaign over Xinjiang, particularly disinformation and harassment of critics overseas, is more in keeping with similar efforts by Russia, including deploying ""whataboutism"" in claiming any US denouncements are tainted by the legacy of slavery and genocide on the American continent.

Warning signs

After she was ""de-radicalized,"" Amina Hojamet swapped her burqa for a silk dress, put a traditional flower-patterned hat on her head, and sang ""Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China.""

She didn't know it at the time, but Hojamet, along with over a dozen other women from her village in Shufu County, in western Xinjiang -- whose story was recounted in a report by the state-run Xinjiang Daily -- would serve as proof of concept for an ""anti-extremism"" campaign that has engulfed the Chinese region since 2017.

According to reliable scholarly estimates, up to 2 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities have passed through a system of detention camps set up throughout Xinjiang in recent years . In the camps, they have been subjected to intense ""re-education,"" designed to strip them of their Islamic faith and ethnic identity in the name of fighting religious terrorism and separatism.

Survivors of the camps report experiencing or witnessing widespread abuse, and incidents of torture, rape and forced sterilization. The crackdown has been denounced as ""genocide"" by the United States government and the Canadian and Dutch parliaments for its effects on the Uyghur people and their culture.

When reports of the camp system first began to emerge around 2017, China issued staunch denials, or refused to comment altogether. As this has become increasingly impossible in the face of mounting international attention and subsequent condemnation, Beijing has shifted to an angry defense of its ""de-radicalization"" program, which it has even started to tout to like-minded countries as a way of dealing with their own Muslim ""problem.""

Meanwhile, evidence of the camp system, such as early reports in state media like one which gave Hojamet's story in late 2014, have been scrubbed from the internet altogether and are accessible only in archived form, a CNN analysis shows. Other materials researchers relied on to expose the camp system -- such as government tenders and official documents -- have also been deleted.

Multiple foreign journalists who reported on the camp system have been expelled from China, while academics, activists and survivors who sought to expose its reach have been denounced, and harassed. Those who have dared speak out inside of China have been silenced or detained.

The clampdown has been accompanied by a new, coordinated propaganda campaign touting the successes of the ""vocational training"" system, with heavily choreographed media tours for sympathetic outlets, interviews with ""graduates"" praising the system, and disinformation which aims to sow confusion about the scale of the camp system and the abuses experienced by detainees, while painting Beijing as the victim of both violent extremism and Western misinformation.

Early reports in Chinese state media about de-radicalisation programs in Xinjiang have since been scrubbed from the internet.

Crackdown

Located in the far west of the People's Republic of China, Xinjiang is among China's most ethnically diverse regions. It is home to about 11 million Uyghurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic minority, who speak a language closely related to Turkish and have their own distinct culture, as well as significant populations of Kazakhs.

Rich in natural resources, especially oil and gas, the region has seen a large influx of Han Chinese, the country's majority ethnic group, amid recent, concerted efforts by the government to tie Xinjiang closer to the wider economy.

Xinjiang -- the name means ""New Frontier"" in Chinese -- has long been of strategic importance for its rulers in Beijing. The vast region borders Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Afghanistan, as well as Mongolia and Russia in the north and Pakistan and India in the south. Its importance has only increased with the advent of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative, a trade and infrastructure mega project connecting China to markets across Central Asia to Europe and beyond.

In the 1990s and 2000s, as the number of Han migrating to Xinjiang increased and the government ramped up efforts to integrate the region, protests and occasionally violent ethnic unrest became more common

Information about such incidents was often hard to come by, with reports in state media sporadic and sparsely detailed. Few foreign journalists ever visited Xinjiang, both due to the region's remoteness from Beijing and the harassment and surveillance by local authorities of those journalists who did travel there.

Such controls only increased as the situation became more unstable and the authorities cracked down harder. In 2009, following deadly ethnic riots in the Xinjiang capital of Urumqi, the entire region was cut off from the internet for almost a year, and many Uyghur writers and intellectuals were jailed.

In October 2013 , a group of Uyghurs were alleged to have driven a sports-utility vehicle into pedestrians on Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Five people died in the incident, described by authorities as a terror attack, including three in the car. Some 40 people were injured.

Following the incident, Xinjiang's anti-terrorism budget doubled. The regional government, meanwhile, said it was ""determined to curb the spread of religious extremism as well as prevent severe violent terrorist attacks."" As part of this, what was called ""vocational training"" could be provided to those ""more easily manipulated by religious extremism.""

In early 2014, 31 people were killed, and more than 100 were injured , during a knife terror attack in a crowded train station in Kunming, in China's southwestern Yunnan Province. Four people were convicted of plotting the attack, which the government blamed on Uyghur separatists.

During a visit to the region in April 2014 in the aftermath of the Kunming attack, President Xi called for an all-out ""struggle against terrorism, infiltration and separatism,"" according to leaked internal speeches published by the New York Times

Around this time, in a village in Shufu County, near the ancient Silk Road trading stop of Kashgar in western Xinjiang, local officials identified 16 women in need of ""educational transformation,"" according to the Xinjiang Daily article. Their offense? Wearing the burqa.

These women, one of whom was Hojamet, were initially ""very resistant and unwilling,"" but ""gradually realized the essence and harm of religious extremism,"" eventually choosing to abandon conservative Islamic dress for regular clothing.

Another woman also told the paper her husband had been detained by the police for religious extremism and taken for ""de-radicalization"" in an unspecified location. ""I hope that he will receive a good education, transform well, and reunite with us soon,"" she was quoted as saying.

Cover-up

While in 2014 and 2015 the burgeoning ""re-education"" system was still years away from reaching its current scale, or from becoming public knowledge, it was clear the situation in Xinjiang had escalated following the high-profile Kunming attack.

Visiting the region weeks later, Ursula Gauthier, a journalist with the French magazine L'Obs, reported an intense system of surveillance, police checkpoints, and widespread fear of being reported or denounced among any Uyghurs she spoke to.

""In Xinjiang, where the police respect legal procedures even less than in the (rest of China), arrests are not reported to families. They simply disappear,"" Gauthier wrote , adding many Uyghurs reported being constantly afraid, such that fear ""creeps into all parts of life, poisons relationships and paralyzes the most serene minds.""

This experience was at the forefront of her mind when, about seven months later, ISIS-linked terrorists attacked targets across Paris , killing 130 people and wounding hundreds more.

Disgusted by the bloodshed in her home capital, Gauthier was also dismayed by the reaction from the Chinese government, which she felt was attempting to take advantage of the incident to gain international support for its crackdown in Xinjiang.

In expressing sympathy with France, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China was also a victim of terrorism and complained about a ""double standard"" in the West in which media and politicians minimized or sought to justify terrorist incidents against Chinese.

In a column for L'Obs , Gauthier noted the astonishing outpouring of sympathy and solidarity she had experienced in Beijing from ordinary people, while pointing out what she felt were the Chinese government's ""ulterior motives"" in conflating ISIS attacks with violence in Xinjiang.

While other outlets made similar observations -- ""China Responds to Paris Attacks Through a Domestic Lens,"" read a headline in the New York Times -- Gauthier's article struck a nerve.

The Global Times, a nationalist, state-run tabloid, published multiple articles attacking her, and she was summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to explain herself. She was told to apologize but refused, saying she was being accused of saying things -- such as that Chinese victims of terror deserved to die -- she never wrote.

Fanning the controversy, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang accused Gauthier of having ""blatantly championed acts of terrorism and slaughter of innocent civilians, igniting indignation among the Chinese people.""

The authorities refused to renew her press card , and on January 1, 2016, she flew out of Beijing for good.

Exposed

While she was not alone in criticizing or exposing China's policies in Xinjiang, or even in calling out Beijing's attempt to conflate ethnic unrest with global terrorism, Gauthier appears to have been caught up in a shifting policy on Xinjiang, as the government became far more sensitive to outside scrutiny.

""We know today that Xi Jinping had made the decision to change the policies in Xinjiang, so in (late 2014) they were preparing the crackdown,"" she said. ""It was just the fact that we didn't know back then.""

The scale of this transformation would not be known for several years. Even as people began disappearing into the camp system, which was built up between 2014 and 2017, before massively expanding that year, the heavy surveillance in Xinjiang, ongoing intense censorship of Uyghur issues on the Chinese internet, and its relative remoteness compared to the rest of the country, meant the news did not immediately spread.

But as human rights groups and members of the Uyghur diaspora started reporting increased disappearances and people being taken away for ""political education,"" a number of foreign journalists were able to travel to Xinjiang to see if the stories were true.

In late 2017, a series of on the ground reports were published by US outlets, BuzzFeed , the Associated Press , and the Wall Street Journal , all testifying to the intense surveillance all Uyghurs in Xinjiang were subject to, and to the burgeoning camp system.

""Since this spring, thousands of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities have disappeared into so-called political education centers, apparently for offenses from using Western social media apps to studying abroad in Muslim countries, according to relatives of those detained,"" Buzzfeed's Megha Rajagopalan reported.

While officials defended security measures in Xinjiang as necessary for preventing terrorism, at first, Beijing denied reports about the camp system, with a foreign ministry spokesman telling Rajagopalan ""we have never heard about these measures taken by local authorities.""

A similar denial would come from China's representative to Kazakhstan, who told reporters ""we don't have such a concept at all in China"" when asked about a CNN report on Uyghurs being sent to political education camps in early 2018 . More often, the Chinese authorities simply refused to comment for stories about Xinjiang.

According to a CNN review of Chinese government statements from 2015 onwards, officials largely avoided addressing the issue of Xinjiang until around mid-2018, when growing scrutiny made this impossible.

In particular, China appears to have switched strategies in response to a hearing of the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in August of that year, where it was estimated by the Germany-based World Uyghur Congress that as many as 1 million people could have passed through the camps

China's representative to the committee said this was ""completely untrue,"" while acknowledging people had been assigned ""to vocational educational and employment training centers with a view to assisting in their rehabilitation.""

Speaking in mid 2019 , Liu Xiaoming, China's ambassador to the UK, gave a staunch defense of the program in an interview with the BBC, saying ""extremist ideas have easy penetration to the poorer areas. The idea is to help the people, to lift them out of poverty.""

""They can leave freely. They can visit their relatives. It is not a prison. It is not a camp,"" Liu said.

While China has sought, sometimes successfully, to muddy the waters on Xinjiang, attacking individual researchers and think tanks, and trotting out family members of survivors to criticize them in dubious videos, much of the evidence showing the scale of the camp system is in fact open source.

For example, the growth of a camp in Shufu County, around 7 kilometers (4.5 miles) from Amina Hojamet's village, can be tracked via satellite imagery on Google Earth. The installation was first built around 2013, though it may have initially been used for another purpose. In the years since, it has more than doubled in size, and what appear to be watchtowers can be seen on walls around dormitory-like buildings, according to a review of historical satellite imagery.

Other open source data helps confirm this: a tender for business issued by the Xinjiang government in 2017, reviewed by CNN, seeks a $21 million refit and expansion of the camp -- described as a Legal Education Transformation School.

As scrutiny over Xinjiang increased, reports in state media about the ""de-radicalization"" program, as well government announcements about the various camps and tenders for supplying them appear to have been scrubbed from the internet, with only a small proportion surviving in archived form.

This effort appears to have been inconsistent, with some materials surviving online, along with reports in state media that can be used to track the evolution of the ""vocational training"" system, even as similar articles which had been written about by human rights groups, such as that which contains Hojamet's story, were deleted.

begun In the past year, Chinese state media and officials have attacking researcher Adrian Zenz, who was the first to use government documents to expose the camps, and the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, which popularized the use of satellite imagery to track their growth. Zenz was among multiple academics and politicians in the European Union and United Kingdom sanctioned by China in March.

Beijing has also punished those journalists who helped draw attention to Xinjiang early on. Rajagopalan, the Buzzfeed reporter, was forced to leave China in August 2018 , after her visa extension was denied. Two years later, Gerry Shih and Josh Chin, who wrote early reports on Xinjiang for the AP and WSJ respectively, were among a number of American reporters expelled from China in retaliation for Trump administration limits on US-based Chinese state media.

Pivot

While it would continue to officially deny any ""camps"" exist in Xinjiang, with Foreign Ministry officials reprimanding reporters who used those terms, from late 2018 onwards, there has been a concerted shift in China's messaging on this issue.

In October of that year , the Xinjiang government all but acknowledged reports about the ""re-education"" system were correct, calling on local officials to expand the number of ""vocational skill education training centers"" and ""carry out anti-extremist ideological education.""

The following week, Shohrat Zakir, a high-ranking Xinjiang government official, told state media the Chinese government was fighting ""terrorism and extremism"" in its own way, and in accordance with UN resolutions.

Former detainees, he said, had been transformed for the better by their time in the ""training centers."" Instead of being led by religion as in the past, now they ""realized that they are firstly citizens of the nation,"" Zakir said.

In a white paper published by the State Council Information Office in August 2019, China's top administrative body wrote ""Xinjiang is a key battlefield in the fight against terrorism and extremism in China.""

""(The government) has established vocational education and training centers in accordance with the law to prevent the breeding and spread of terrorism and religious extremism, effectively curbing the frequent terrorist incidents and protecting the rights to life, health, and development of the people of all ethnic groups,"" the paper said, adding ""worthwhile results have been achieved.""

A watchtower on a high-security facility near what is believed to be a re-education camp where mostly Muslim ethnic minorities are detained, on the outskirts of Hotan, Xinjiang, on May 31, 2019.

Sean Roberts, an expert on Central Asia at the George Washington University and author of ""The War on the Uyghurs: China's Internal Campaign against a Muslim Minority,"" said many officials in Xinjiang appeared to have internalized Beijing's narrative on the issue.

""People high up know the real extent of the threat and how minor it is, but I think some of the lower level officials really do believe what they are doing is saving Uyghurs from extremism and terrorism,"" he said.

At the international level, Beijing has leaned on its allies to push back on criticism from western countries over Xinjiang. After a representative for the United Kingdom issued a statement at the UN General Assembly in 2019 on behalf of 23 countries raising concerns about human rights abuses, Belarus made its own statement on behalf of 54 countries voicing approval of China's ""counter-terrorism"" program in Xinjiang. Signatories included close allies of China, such as Russia, Egypt, Bolivia and Serbia.

""They have a kind of hubris about this,"" Roberts said of how China's messaging has evolved since then. ""There's a level of confidence in having escaped a lot of criticism from the international community, a sense that nobody is actually going to punish us for this.""

As well as securing international recognition (of sorts) for its efforts in Xinjiang, Beijing has also sought to link its ""de-radicalization"" program with anti-extremism efforts elsewhere, providing a sheen of legitimacy even in practice the comparisons are rather far-fetched.

Foreign Minister Wang Yi, among other officials, has claimed China's system is in keeping with the UN ""Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism.""

""The Plan of Action suggests early engagement and combining counter-extremism actions with preventive measures,"" Wang said in a 2019 speech. ""That is precisely what Xinjiang has been doing. Visible progress has been made: There has not been a single case of violent terrorism in the past three years.""

That same year , Zakir, the region's top Uyghur official, said ""most (detainees) have already gone back to society.""

""I can say 90% of them have found suitable and enjoyable jobs that bring them considerable income,"" he said, adding many Uyghurs were originally lacking employable skills and jobless, though records kept by overseas Uyghur groups suggest many intellectuals and highly-qualified individuals have also been sent to the camps.

Both French and British programs involve individuals convicted of terrorism offences or on watchlists, and are governed by both domestic human rights law and the European Convention on Human Rights. By contrast, many detainees in Xinjiang are locked up for non-terror related offences , such as breaching family planning regulations, or for religious practices deemed to be indicative of alleged ""extremism,"" such as wearing the burqa, growing a beard, or reading the Quran.

For its part, the UN plan also notes ""violations of international human rights law committed in the name of state security can facilitate violent extremism by marginalizing individuals and alienating key constituencies, thus generating community support and sympathy for and complicity in the actions of violent extremists.""

Government tenders for expanding and stocking internment camps in Xinjiang provided early evidence of the system's size and scope.

Propaganda

Months after censors scrubbed stories like Amina Hojamet's from the internet in an apparent attempt to cover-up evidence of what was going on in Xinjiang, a new wave of propaganda was pushed out by Beijing, emphasizing both the supposed terrorist threat and the success of the government's so-called ""anti-extremism"" program in tackling it.

In a video published by state broadcaster CGTN in late 2019 , one prominent interviewee suggests -- over footage of the 9/11 attacks and the Boston Marathon bombings -- that the response to such attacks in the West may ""have actually served to help the purposes of terrorists and their organizations.""

""In their responses, you can see the main reasons why terrorism has failed to be curbed at the root,"" says Li Wei, a research fellow at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, a government think tank.

During an anti-terrorism symposium held on the sidelines of the UN Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva in 2020, co-sponsored by Beijing's mission to the UN, participants heard how ""China is willing to share the 'Chinese experience' with the international community,"" according to an official write up of the event

This shift may have been motivated by a wave of leaks -- largely unheard of in Chinese politics -- which exposed both the scale of the camps and the largely inconsequential ""offences"" which got detainees sent there, as well as the involvement of President Xi and other top officials in putting the system in place.

While China denounced the leaks, secret speeches credited to Xi published by the New York Times appear to line up with coverage in state media from the time they were given. With Xi so publicly identified as one of the architects of what has since been called a genocide in Xinjiang, China's propaganda bureau may have felt obliged to spin the entire situation as a success.

Xi himself said in September 2020 that the policy followed in Xinjiang has been ""completely correct,"" and called on the government to ""tell the story of Xinjiang in a multi-level, all-round, and three-dimensional manner, and confidently propagate the excellent social stability of Xinjiang.""

A facility believed to be a re-education camp where mostly Muslim ethnic minorities are detained, in Artux, north of Kashgar, on June 2, 2019.

Chinese state media, particularly those outlets targeting foreign audiences, have pushed this line hard. While stories such as Hojamet's were scrubbed from the internet in what may have been a kneejerk reaction to international criticism, they have been replaced by a glut of content showcasing happy, successful graduates from the ""vocational training"" system.

""Through the training, I realized that my past beliefs were completely wrong and religious extremism was our enemy. It's a disease which poisons our body and a drug which leads us to death,"" one woman told reporters at a press conference held by the Xinjiang government. ""I must stay away from religious extremism and lead a normal life.""

Foreign diplomats from countries close to China -- including Iran, Pakistan and Russia -- have been invited to tour Xinjiang, even visiting camps, though representatives from the US and other countries have complained of being denied unfettered access to the region.

China's propaganda organs have also organized tightly-controlled press trips to Xinjiang, again mostly for media thought to be sympathetic, though early on, several international press agencies were invited to visit a camp, resulting in embarrassment for Beijing when they reported the situation there largely matched the testimony of survivors

Such visits have been denounced as ""Potemkin-style propaganda tours for unwitting foreigners"" by Amnesty International, producing a stream of positive stories about the situation in the camps and China's success in fighting terrorism which often blindly repeat official propaganda.

One of the few US publications able to send a correspondent to Xinjiang in recent years was International Focus, a tiny Houston-based magazine which caters to the city's diplomatic community.

According to a piece by publisher Val Thompson from May 2019 , she was invited to go to Xinjiang by the State Council Information Office, joining a multinational group of journalists.

Writing of visiting the government-run ""Exhibition of Major Terrorist Attacks and Violent Crimes in Xinjiang,"" Thompson said the experience was ""eye-opening, I had no idea the PRC was dealing with extremist activity.""

At the Kashgar Vocational Skills Educational and Training Center, she said she interviewed ""several"" detainees, who ""were, or could be, victims of extremist teaching.""

""They were treated well by their supervisors,"" Thompson wrote in her article, which has been promoted online by China's State Council. ""For those who want to believe these young people may have been coerced, I say you can't fake happiness; and happiness is exactly what I saw.""

Thompson and International Focus did not respond to a request for comment.

In recent weeks, China's propaganda organs have ramped up their counter narrative, including producing a musical -- ""The Wings of Song"" -- purporting to show the ethnic harmony that exists in modern Xinjiang.

State broadcaster CGTN, which targets foreign audiences, also dispatched a reporter to Kashgar last month, from where she filed live reports , signing off with the line: ""There's definitely no genocide, so to speak. So Michelle, back to you.""

One video released by CGTN may have made the opposite point however: a new documentary about the threat of ""extremism"" that existed prior to the recent crackdown gave as examples textbooks published and approved by China's own propaganda organs, demonstrating how previously innocuous references to Uyghur culture and Islam have become taboo.

Retaliation

This propaganda push appears to have been successful, particularly in convincing many Muslim majority countries to back Beijing , or at least in giving their leaders cover in doing so.

Not all journalists who were taken on government-run tours of Xinjiang were convinced, however. The experience of Olsi Jazexhi since he first wrote about his trip is indicative of how far China will allegedly go to try and control the narrative over Xinjiang, and tear down those who attempt to challenge it.

A Canadian-Albanian writer and historian, Jazexhi said he wanted to visit Xinjiang after reading reports in Western media which he felt were exaggerated. He was highly suspicious of the involvement of the US government, fearing it was attempting to promote extremism among Uyghurs, or fabricate human rights abuses in order to attack China.

""I'm generally skeptical of Western propaganda about the rest of the world,"" Jazexhi said. ""Very often they lie.""

After showing his writing and YouTube channel to the Chinese embassy in Tirana, the Albanian capital, Jazexhi was approved to join a trip to Xinjiang in August 2019, along with 20 other journalists, most of whom were from Muslim countries, he said.

""The desire of the Communist Party was that when we go back to our home countries we would say things are fine in Xinjiang and the Americans and whoever are lying about the Uyghur issue,"" Jazexhi said.

The Xinjiang capital of Urumqi on October 1, 2020.

At first, landing in Urumqi, he was greatly impressed. The Xinjiang capital had undergone significant development in recent years, and was, in Jazexhi's eyes, ""better built and more beautiful than Toronto.""

But then the real propaganda started, with a series of lectures by Chinese historians and local officials, as well as tours of terrorism exhibits such as that described by Thompson.

A historian of Islam and nationalism, and knowledgeable about Central Asia, Jazexhi was appalled by what he heard.

""The narrative was Xinjiang has always been a part of China and these Turks and Islam are latecomers,"" said Jazexhi. ""It shocked not only me but even other Muslim journalists on the tour. It depicted Islam as a primitive religion, and Uyghurs as invaders and newcomers, who were Islamized by less civilized Arabs.""

Similar claims have been made in Chinese government documents , and in interviews given by officials to state media , such as one where the mayor and deputy Party chief of Urumqi described the idea of Uyghurs being native to Xinjiang as a ""ridiculous, ignorant and condemnable"" fallacy.

""The Uyghur people are members of the Chinese family, not descendants of the Turks, let alone anything to do with Turkish people,"" he added.

Jazexhi's experience in the ""vocational training and education centers"" his tour was taken to visit was even more eye-opening.

After ""being brainwashed for two to three days that China is suffering from Islamic extremism,"" Jazexhi said he expected to come face to face with a Chinese version of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the former leader of ISIS.

Instead, the people he spoke to -- via a government interpreter -- were normal men and women, whose ""only mistake to end up in this detention center was that they had read a history of East Turkestan online, or read the Quran with their mother, or prayed with their father.""

While his Chinese minders said the place was not a prison, Jazexhi said they admitted detainees could not leave, nor could they talk to relatives except via tightly-controlled, weekly video calls.

""It was a prison but it was painted in such a way to give us an impression that it was a school,"" he said. ""When we asked (detainees) questions in Turkish or English they did not dare to respond before asking their Chinese minders what to say.""

In one video taken by Jazexhi during his trip, he spoke with a 23-year-old woman in a camp in Aksu. Through a government interpreter, the woman said she had been detained for ""watching unlawful videos,"" wearing a burqa and encouraging other women in her village to do the same.

He said the stories were ""unimaginable,"" adding that two female journalists from the Middle East, both of whom were veiled, were particularly upset to hear from Uyghur detainees that they were there for wearing a hijab or burqa.

""From our visit to two camps, in Kashgar and Aksu, we saw beyond doubt that China is openly eradicating the Islamic identity and Turkish identity of these people,"" Jazexhi said. ""I went to defend China but I found out I could not defend it.""

When he asked his fellow journalists if they planned to write about what they saw, most demurred, saying they would not be allowed to. Jazexhi's minders, meanwhile, had apparently become aware the trip was not having the desired impression, and began shadowing him ever more closely.

""They were really displeased by our attitude when we were inside Xinjiang, because they understood in a way that they had failed with our group,"" he said. ""They even warned us not to dare to report anything negative because that would be unacceptable.""

Upon returning to Albania and publishing his findings, Jazexhi said he has suffered retaliation from China. A university he taught at canceled his courses, which he said was due to Chinese pressure.

A spokesman for the Xinjiang government accused Jazexhi of being unethical and ""spreading false information,"" while China's ambassador to Turkey denounced an article by Jazexhi as one ""in which facts are distorted and basic knowledge is absent."" Chinese state media suggested Jazexhi was driven by ""malice"" and his actions ""went against the basic professional ethics as a reporter.""

The pushback against Jazexhi, however, is nothing compared to how vociferously Chinese officials have gone after some former detainees, attacking the ""inferior character"" of one woman who had spoken to foreign reporters and publicising her alleged medical history.

Another critic, Gulchehra Hoja, a prominent Uyghur journalist who previously spoke to CNN about her family's experiences in the camp system , said she recently discovered she had been placed on a terrorist wanted list, after China's foreign ministry publicly denounced her and claimed she lied about her parents having been detained.

""It's a completely baseless accusation and it's outrageous,"" she told CNN. ""My only crime is being a journalist reporting on what's happening to the Uyghurs.""

This ""with us or against us"" attitude has ramped up considerably in recent months, with new sanctions passed by Beijing against UK and EU lawmakers and think tanks, as well as numerous boycotts of Western companies such as H&M and Nike which have expressed concern about using Xinjiang cotton in their supply lines.

A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Albania said Jazexhi's claims were ""untrue"" and referred questions about his employment to his former university, which did not respond to a request for comment. His former employer also did not respond.

""All my life I have criticized the Americans, but never have I been blacklisted by the American government, had my name condemned,"" Jazexhi said. ""The Chinese are even more angry with me because they invited me, I was their guest.""

He added that he had been told ""that if I shut up, I would have 'opportunities,' but I said I cannot lie about the horror I've seen, I'm a Muslim.""",5693,35888,9,55
0,Google uses ‘double-Irish’ to shift $75.4bn in profits out of Ireland,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/google-uses-double-irish-to-shift-75-4bn-in-profits-out-of-ireland-1.4540519,"Google shifted more than $75.4 billion (€63 billion) in profits out of the Republic using the controversial “double-Irish” tax arrangement in 2019, the last year in which it used the loophole.

The technology giant availed of the tax arrangement to move the money out of Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Company via interim dividends and other payments. This company was incorporated in Ireland but tax domiciled in Bermuda at the time of the transfer.

The move allowed Google Ireland Holdings to escape corporation tax both in the Republic and in the United States where its ultimate parent, Alphabet, is headquartered. The holding company reported a $13 billion pretax profit for 2019, which was effectively tax-free, the accounts show.

A year earlier, Google Ireland Holdings paid out dividends of €23 billion, having recorded turnover of $25.7 billion.

Google has used the double Irish loophole to funnel billions in global profits through Ireland and on to Bermuda, effectively putting them beyond the reach of US tax authorities.

Companies exploiting the double Irish put their intellectual property into an Irish-registered company that is controlled from a tax haven such as Bermuda.

Ireland considers the company to be tax-resident in Bermuda, while the US considers it to be tax-resident here. The result is that when royalty payments are sent to the company, they go untaxed – unless or until the money is eventually sent home to the US parent.

The “double Irish” was abolished in 2015 for new companies establishing operations in the Republic. However, controversially, it allowed those already using it until the end of 2020 to phase it out.

Google overhauled its global tax structure and consolidated its intellectual property holdings back to the United States in early 2020, meaning 2019 was the final year in which it availed of the arrangement.

Up to late 2019, Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Company was an intellectual property licensing company with turnover derived from the licensing of IP to subsidiaries. The accounts state it had no employees and that it was tax resident at the time in Bermuda, where the “standard rate tax is 0 per cent”.

Holding company

Commenting on the movement of the profits out of its Irish unit, a spokeswoman for Google said: “In December 2019, in line with the OECD’s base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) conclusions and changes to US and Irish tax laws, we simplified our corporate structure and started licensing our IP from the US, not Bermuda. The accounts filed today cover the 2019 financial year, before we made those changes.

“Including all annual and one-time income taxes over the past ten years, our global effective tax rate has been over 20 per cent, with more than 80 per cent of that tax due in the US,” she added.

The accounts state that Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Company became tax resident in Ireland from January 1st, 2021, and that it now just operates as a holding company.

Turnover for the holding company rose from $25.7 billion in 2018 to $26.5 billion in 2019. The increase was primarily due to a rise in turnover recorded by the company’s subsidiaries, which results in higher royalty payments.

Dividend income from shares in group undertakings jumped from just $2.9 million in 2018 to $597.5 million a year later. The accounts also show a $3 billion increase in research and development costs in 2019, with the company incurring R&D expenses of $10.4 billion under a cost-sharing agreement with other Google entities globally.

Google Ireland, the tech company’s main operating Irish subsidiary with over 4,000 employees, recorded €45.7 billion in revenues in 2019 with pretax profits amounting to €1.94 billion. It paid €263 million in tax that year, down nearly €9 million versus 2018.

It is estimated that US multinationals were holding more than a $1 trillion in profits offshore via mechanisms such as the double Irish and the so-called Dutch sandwich by the end of 2017. Tax cuts introduced by former US president Donald Trump in 2019 have led to some of those profits being repatriated to the United States.",676,4125,11,69

We don’t want to limit the passion of our fans and their ability to express themselves, but there are plenty of horrible things about homosexuals you can shout instead.” Henry added that he understood change is difficult, and that once fans return to games, there would be an eight-decade probationary period before fans yelling racist remarks were removed from the stands.

New U.S. sanctions on Russia are ""mostly symbolic"" and will have minimal impact on markets and the macroeconomic outlook, economists have suggested.

President Biden's administration on Thursday announced a raft of new sanctions against Moscow over 2020 election interference, a huge cyberattack on U.S. government and corporate networks, illegal annexation and occupation of Ukraine's Crimea, and human rights abuses.

Sanctions targeted 16 entities and 16 individuals accused of attempting to influence the 2020 U.S. presidential election, along with five individuals and three entities linked to the Crimea annexation, and expelled 10 Russian diplomats from the U.S.

Washington also imposed sanctions on newly-issued Russian sovereign debt, which caused a slight sell-off in the Russian ruble and sovereign bonds on Thursday.

The move prevents U.S. financial institutions from participating in the primary market for ruble and non-ruble denominated debt after June 14.

'Symbolic exercise'

However, economists do not foresee any tangible fallout from the sanctions in their current form.

""The latest round of U.S. sanctions was a mostly symbolic exercise,"" Agathe Demarais, global forecasting director at The Economist Intelligence Unit, told CNBC on Friday.

""Sanctions on Russian individuals and companies are irrelevant, as these people and firms have no ties to the US and probably no intention to ever use the U.S. dollar or to have bank accounts in the U.S.""

Demarais added that the sanctions on sovereign debt are less stringent than the initial market reaction would suggest, since they only target the primary debt market and can therefore ""easily be circumvented via the secondary market.""",323,2106,13,86

1,Whoopsies: The Vatican Has Ruled That Nintendo Committed A Venial Sin After Imbuing Lifeless Paper Products With The Soul Of Mario,https://ogn.theonion.com/whoopsies-the-vatican-has-ruled-that-nintendo-committe-1844519423,"We’ve got some embarrassing news, gamers. After Paper Mario: The Origami King’s positive reception and solid sales, we thought Nintendo was sitting pretty for the summer. But a recent papal brief issued from Vatican City suggests that the iconic video game company might have stepped in it with the Catholic Church. According to Pope Francis’ latest papal bull, Verbum Chartum, Nintendo committed a venial sin when they imbued a lifeless paper product with the soul of Mario.

Whoopsies. Sounds like Nintendo might need to clutch their rosary beads close and say a few extra “Hail Marys” to get back in the Lord’s good graces!

“The messianic message of Christ and His activity among people affirm the truth that the soul cannot transmigrate, and certainly cannot pass into an origami form as Nintendo mistakenly asserts in The Origami King,” wrote Pope Francis in an 2,500-word treatise addressed to the faith’s 1.3 billion faithful, suggesting that those who took part in Paper Mario’s creation or even played the RPG out of curiosity had unquestionably trespassed in the eyes of God. “Let us not forget the great teaching offered by Saint John Paul II in his Dives In Misericordia encyclical, that the Lord created humanity in His image—not as a 2D sheet of paper invested with the soul of a plumber able to crush Goombas with a blow from his Legendary Hammer.”

“Simply put, a lifeless origami doll invested with the soul of Mario, Peach, Bowser, or Luigi is an affront to the word of Our Heavenly Father,” the Bishop of Rome continued. “May God have mercy on [Game Director] Masahiko Nagaya’s soul and the souls of all who enjoy playing this perversion of nature.”

Sorry, gamers! Looks like the very act of playing Paper Mario is going to get you sent to Purgatory! Thankfully, it’s only a venial sin, so you can atone for it by going to confession, performing penance, and even getting extreme unction on your deathbed.

Despite the harsh words from the Holy See, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa stood by the company’s artistic decisions, simply recommending that Paper Mario: Origami King’s creative team and fans regularly attend confessional and remember to say their “Our Fathers” while expressing regret that the Vatican had chosen to excommunicate Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser and gaming icon Shigeru Miyamoto for their unforgivable decision to give life to that to which God did not give a living soul.

Oof. Nintendo really stepped in it this time! We can only hope Nintendo and the Catholic Church patch things up. We haven’t seen things this bad since Pope John Paul’s apostolic letter Novo Millennio Ineunte, which repeatedly condemned Dr. Mario for his history of performing abortions.",453,2752,21,130

O plánovaném vyhoštění ruských diplomatů, kteří musí území České republiky opustit do 48 hodin byl už informován i prezident Miloš Zeman. „Prezident nám vyjádřil absolutní podporu,“ zdůraznil Babiš. „Česká republika je svrchovaný stát a musí odpovídajícím způsobem reagovat,“ prohlásil premiér.

„Prezident republiky byl o případu informován panem předsedou vlády i panem vicepremiérem v průběhu soboty. Prezident republiky tedy veškeré informace má k dispozici. Nejvyšší ústavní činitelé postupují v součinnosti,“ uvedl Zemanův mluvčí Jiří Ovčáček.



„Mě mrzí, že utrpí česko-ruské vztahy, nicméně Česká republika musí reagovat,“ zdůraznil ministr vnitra Jan Hamáček, který dočasně řídí resort zahraničních věcí, než bude do úřadu ve středu jmenován nový ministr zahraničí Jakub Kulhánek.

Před společným vystoupením s Babišem si Hamáček předvolal ruského velvyslance Alexandra Zmejevského.

Babiš o incidentu a vyhoštění ruských diplomatů mluvil v sobotu večer i se šéfem Evropské rady Charlesem Michelem. Partnery v Evropské unii chce podrobně informovat na příštím summitu, uvedl premiér večer na Twitteru.

„Pokud do areálu vstoupili, tak bez vědomí firmy,“ řekl v sobotu portálu iROZHLAS.cz Radek Ondruš, právní zástupce firmy Imex, která si prostory ve Vrběticích pronajímala. O jménech agentů podle svých slov nikdy neslyšel. „Nikdo takový v téhle době do firmy nepřijel. Pro návštěvníky z jednoho ze zahraničních států, nebylo to Rusko, se vyřizovalo povolení. Bylo to pro dva lidi, ale ti nakonec nepřijeli nebo se neohlásili,“ řekl portálu.

Sílící napětí mezi Ruskem a USA a spojenci

Mezi Ruskem na jedné straně a USA a zeměmi Evropské unie na druhé panuje napětí, protože Rusko shromažďuje vojenské síly u hranic s Ukrajinou. (poslední vývoj v článku Do Černého moře dorazilo sedmnáct ruských vojenských lodí, další připlují)

„Česko se tímto oznámením přihlásilo k ostrému kurzu vůči Rusku. Je ale otázkou, kdy se tato informace dostala k vládním představitelům, protože vyšetřování probíhalo delší dobu a údajně se záležitost měla projednávat před čtrnácti dny ve zpravodajském výboru,“ poukázal Miroslav Mareš z katedry politologie na Masarykově univerzitě na načasování českého oznámení.

Portál Lidovky.cz uvedl s odkazem na zdroje blízké vyšetřování, že muži hledaní NCOZ se do areálu ve Vrběticích dostali už 15. října, den před výbuchem, a nastražili tam výbušné zařízení. To však explodovalo dříve, než plánovali, zabít zřejmě mělo někoho, komu byla určena dodávka zbraní, uvedly Lidovky.

Terčem pro GRU podle mezinárodní investigativní skupiny Bellingcat byl jeden z významných bulharských obchodníků se zbraněmi Emilian Gebrev, kterého se na Balkáně údajně pokusili členové ruské rozvědky dvakrát otrávit.



Podle portálu Seznam Zprávy se ruská rozvědka GRU zaměřila na Vrbětice kvůli válce v Sýrii, kam měla údajně munice z vrbětického skladu směřovat. Podle vyšetřovatelů mohlo jít o sabotáž, aby munice ze skladu nemohla putovat k Američanům, kteří tak chtěli pomoci povstalcům v Sýrii bojujícím proti syrskému prezidentovi Bašáru Asadovi, napsal portál. Rusové naopak Asadův režim podporovali.



Při výbuchu ve Vrběticích zahynuli dva lidé

Jeden sklad ve Vrběticích vybuchl v říjnu 2014, druhý v prosinci téhož roku. Při prvním výbuchu zemřeli dva lidé. Sklady si pronajímala ostravská firma Imex Group. Policie exploze vyšetřuje jako úmyslné obecné ohrožení. Munice uložená v dalších skladech byla z Vrbětic odvezena.



Podle premiéra Babiše existuje „důvodné podezření o zapojení důstojníků ruské vojenské zpravodajské služby GRU, jednotky 29155“ do výbuchu muničního skladu ve Vrběticích.



Při výbuších bylo zasaženo 1319 hektarů půdy, z toho zhruba 341 hektarů přímo v areálu. Většinu pozemků už mají zpět v užívání jejich majitelé. V budoucnu by měly získat všechny pozemky a objekty v areálu do svého majetku Vojenské lesy a statky ČR, které na nich plánují hospodařit. (shrnutí dění kolem výbuchu čtěte zde)

0,Cuba's Raul Castro is stepping down as head of its Communist Party,https://us.yahoo.com/news/cubas-raul-castro-stepping-down-143526775.html,"Raul Castro is stepping down as the head of the Communist Party of Cuba, the most powerful position on the island, with few expectations of significant change among Cubans.

It is however, a historic move — Castro and his late brother, Fidel Castro, have been in power since the 1959 revolution.

The Communist Party’s eighth congress will begin Friday when it will certify President Miguel Díaz-Canel as the next party secretary-general and set policy guidelines. Raul Castro had said in 2018 he expected Díaz-Canel to replace him after his retirement in 2021. Díaz-Canel, 60, represents a new generation and is serving the first of two five-year terms as president.

Many analysts believe Castro, who turns 90 in June, will continue to be the most influential figure on the island until his death.

In Cuba, major events are put together during historic celebrations and this year’s congress is no exception. It coincides with the 60th anniversary of the failed, CIA-backed Bay of Pigs invasion.

Castro’s retirement comes as Cuba, one of the last communist run-countries in the world, is facing multiple challenges. Its economy shrank 11 percent in 2020 due to the pandemic, and it's been grappling with tightened U.S. sanctions and a decline in aid from its ally, Venezuela. The government lacks hard currency to import food and medicine, which means endless lines outside stores when food becomes available, and one meal a day for some families.

The country is also dealing with a spike in Covid-19 cases. Strict lockdowns and measures have kept the numbers of cases and deaths below those of most countries in the region, but they have also tested the patience of many Cubans. Cuba has developed five vaccine candidates and two are in late-stage trials.

The country’s challenges have led to public discontent at levels rarely seen since the 1959 communist revolution. Mobile internet has allowed videos of protests to quickly spread among Cubans and also helped activists mobilize. A large protest in November by artists demanding greater freedom of expression made headlines across the globe.

Story continues

President Joe Biden campaigned on reversing some of the previous administration’s harsh measures, such as limits on remittances and restricted travel to the island by Americans while focusing on human rights. But so far, administration officials have indicated they won’t be making changes anytime soon. Juan Gonzalez, executive director of the National Security Council, said recently that the “political moment” has changed from the Obama administration years and that “oppression against Cubans is worse today than perhaps during the Bush years.”

Disenchantment in the island over the country’s centrally planned system, stagnant economy and decaying infrastructure has been brewing for years, especially among younger Cubans. During the Communist Party’s congress in 2011, a set of ambitious economic reforms were promised that have not been fully implemented.

Victoria Hernández 37, an entrepreneur who sells products such as hangers and batteries in East Havana, says she does not expect much from the congress.

“I think our officials should change their mentality more to improve things. Right now what we’re thinking about is food. I want to also think about having a car, a better house,” she said.

Need for economic reform

But some experts believe Castro's move is important in order to speed up economic reforms. This involves strategic decisions in order to keep the public more content without ceding the tight grip the party has over society.

Arturo López-Levy, a professor at Holy Names University in California, thinks the economic reforms will gain traction once the pandemic is under control.

“What is happening now is a new generation is consolidating control,” he said. “Now they will be forced to make important reforms, because their legitimacy doesn't come from a revolutionary background, but from being capable of showing better performance.”

He said there aren’t high expectations among Cubans because the country “will remain a Leninist system and that basically means the political monopoly of the Communist Party.”

Fabio Fernández, a history professor at the University of Havana, often quoted in the Communist Party newspaper Granma, says it’s important for the party to move forward, fulfill the economic reforms it promised over a decade ago, and make political changes without abandoning its socialist system.

“A new concept of Cuban socialism is what we need to adopt because the old one no longer works,” he said.

The interception scattered debris on Jizan University’s campus, which caused a fire that has been contained, the Saudi-led coalition at war in Yemen said in a statement. It said no one was killed, and there were no immediate reports of injuries.

Video on social media purportedly showed a Patriot missile flying low across Jizan to intercept a missile or drone, with it detonating over the city.

The barrage came just hours after Saudi Arabia warned Iran its recent decision to push its nuclear enrichment to its highest level ever risked raising tensions in the Mideast.

The Saudi statement blamed the Iran-backed Houthi group for the attack, saying the five ballistic missiles and four bomb-laden drones specifically targeted civilian areas and had been launched from the rebels’ stronghold of Saada in Yemen.

Houthi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yehia Sarie tweeted Thursday that his group had launched 11 missiles and drones at Saudi Arabia, targeting the kingdom’s Patriot defense system, oil sites and other “critical” areas in Jizan. Sarie did not mention the university.

The conflict in Yemen was sparked by the Houthis takeover of the capital, Sanaa, in 2014, which forced the internationally recognized government to flee the city. A Saudi-led coalition, which until recently was supported by the U.S., has been fighting the Houthis nearly ever since.

The U.N. humanitarian office says the war has caused an estimated 233,000 deaths, including 131,000 from indirect causes such as lack of food, health services and infrastructure. The conflict came on the heels of years of unrest and protests in Yemen against endemic corruption and government mismanagement.

Political deadlock and conflict in Yemen have created the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Aid groups report more than 20 million people in the impoverished Arab nation are experiencing food insecurity and half of them are at risk of famine.

Rights groups have criticized all sides in the conflict, but note that Saudi-led airstrikes have often been disproportionate and killed thousands of civilians.

Since the war began, the Houthis have launched over 550 bomb-laden drones and more than 350 ballistic missiles toward Saudi Arabia, the kingdom told The Associated Press in April .

On Wednesday, the U.S. State Department issued a warning to Americans to reconsider travel to the kingdom over the missile and drone attacks, as well as the coronavirus pandemic.

“Missile and drone attacks perpetrated by Iran and Iran-supported militant groups represent a significant threat,” the warning said. “U.S. citizens living and working near military bases and critical civilian infrastructure, particularly near the border with Yemen, are at heightened risk of missile, drone and rocket attacks.",465,3013,9,57

BAZ RATNER/Reuters

The young mother was trying to get home with food for her two children when she says soldiers pulled her off a minibus in Ethiopia’s Tigray region, claiming it was overloaded.

It was the beginning of an 11-day ordeal in February, during which she says she was repeatedly raped by 23 soldiers who forced nails, a rock and other items into her vagina, and threatened her with a knife.

Doctors showed Reuters the bloodstained stone and two 3-inch nails they said they had removed from her body.

The woman, 27, is among hundreds who have reported that they were subjected to horrific sexual violence by Ethiopian and allied Eritrean soldiers after fighting broke out in November in the mountainous northern region of Ethiopia, doctors said.

Some women were held captive for extended periods, days or weeks at a time, said Dr. Fasika Amdeselassie, the top public health official for the government-appointed interim administration in Tigray.

“Women are being kept in sexual slavery,” Fasika told Reuters. “The perpetrators have to be investigated.”

Reports of rape have been circulating for months. But Fasika’s assertion, based on women’s accounts, marks the first time an Ethiopian official – in this case, a top regional health officer – has made a sexual slavery accusation in connection with the conflict in Tigray.

In addition, eight other doctors at five public hospitals told Reuters that most of the rape victims described their attackers as either Ethiopian government soldiers or Eritrean troops. It was more common for women to report sexual violence by Eritrean soldiers, the doctors said.

The Eritreans have been helping Ethiopia’s central government fight the region’s former ruling party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), in the conflict plaguing the Horn of Africa nation.

Taken together, the descriptions paint the most detailed picture to date of the sexual violence against women in Tigray and the military’s alleged involvement in it.

Most people interviewed for this article declined to be identified. They said they feared reprisals, including possible violence, by soldiers who guard the hospitals and towns.

Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed acknowledged in a speech to parliament on March 23 that “atrocities were being committed by raping women” and promised that the perpetrators would be punished. He did not identify the alleged perpetrators.

He said then for the first time that Eritrean soldiers had entered the conflict in Tigray in support of the Ethiopian government after the TPLF attacked military bases across the region in the early hours of Nov. 4. Ethiopia’s government had previously denied this, and the Eritrean government still does not acknowledge their troops’ presence. The TPLF was the dominant power in the central government when Eritrea fought a bloody border war with Ethiopia a generation ago.

Neither the Ethiopian nor the Eritrean governments responded to Reuters’ questions about specific cases raised by women and their doctors, or about the accusation of sexual slavery. No charges have been announced by civilian or military prosecutors against any soldiers. However, officials in both countries emphasized that their governments have zero tolerance for sexual violence – a point Abiy’s spokeswoman, Billene Seyoum, said the prime minister reiterated recently in discussions with military leaders.

The alleged sexual violence has drawn international attention.

Billene said the United Nations, the African Union and Ethiopia’s state-appointed human rights commission have been authorized to carry out joint investigations into alleged abuses by all sides in the conflict. That includes the “criminal clique,” she said, referring to the TPLF.

An Ethiopian military spokesman and the head of a government task force on the Tigray crisis did not respond to phone calls and text messages seeking comment. Reuters could not reach military leaders in either country.

Asked about the reports that Eritrean troops have committed rapes in Tigray and are keeping women in sexual slavery, the country’s information minister, Yemane Gebremeskel, accused TPLF activists of “coaching ‘sympathizers’ to create false testimonies.”

“All the fabricated stories – which are alien to our culture and laws – are peddled to cover up the crimes of the TPLF which started the war,” he told Reuters in a written response.

Reuters was unable to reach a TPLF spokesman.

RECORDS OF ABUSE

Fasika, the health official, said at least 829 cases of sexual assault have been reported at the five hospitals since the conflict in Tigray began.

Those cases were likely “the tip of the iceberg,” Fasika said. Rape is under-reported in Ethiopia because it carries a huge stigma. Also, most of the region’s health facilities are no longer functioning, and travel between towns remains dangerous, he said.

Story continues below advertisement

Most of the women who have come forward are either pregnant or sustained severe physical injury from the rapes, Fasika said.

Reuters interviewed 11 women who said they had been raped by soldiers from Eritrea, Ethiopia or both. Four said they were kidnapped, taken to military camps and gang raped, in some cases alongside other women. The women did not know the camp names but said they were located near Mekelle and the towns of Idaga Hamus, Wukro and Sheraro.

Five other women said they were held in fields or deserted houses for up to six days. And two said they were raped in their own homes.

Reuters could not independently verify their accounts. However, all told similar stories of being beaten and brutalized. Healthcare providers confirmed that the 11 women’s injuries were consistent with the events they described, and they showed Reuters medical records for three of the women detailing their conditions.

The health care providers also shared details of nine other cases of sexual assault, including the ordeals of two 14-year-old girls.

Although Ethiopia’s government declared victory over the TPLF in November, fighting continues in some areas, and medical workers say new rapes are reported at the region’s health facilities every day.

“This is being done to dishonour the women, to break their pride,” said a doctor at Ayder Referral Hospital, in Mekelle, citing the brutality of the attacks and humiliation of victims. “This is not for sexual gratification. The rapes are to punish Tigray.”

‘TELL MY STORY’

The 27-year-old mother said uniformed soldiers from Eritrea pulled her off a minibus on the road from Mekelle to the city of Adigrat on Feb. 6. They tied her up and marched her through fields to a bush camp, she said. After 11 days of rapes and beatings, she said, the soldiers forced nails, cotton, plastic bags and a rock into her vagina and left her alone in the bush.

Villagers found her unconscious and brought her to a nearby hospital.

She said she was still bleeding from severe internal injuries and could not control her urine, walk without a crutch or sit up for long periods. One leg was broken, she said.

She also described a different kind of pain: While in the hospital, she has no way to speak to her 4-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter because the Eritrean soldiers took her cellphone. She had left the children with her mother to search for food and never returned. At the time, the family had less than a week’s worth of bread.

“I don’t know anything, if they are dead or alive,” she said. “The enemy destroyed my life.”

A 32-year-old mother in Mekelle told Reuters that soldiers removed her from a minibus on the same road at the end of February. They were dressed in Ethiopian uniforms, she said, but spoke with an Eritrean accent and had traditional facial scarification typical of the neighbouring country. She said they shot her 12-year-old son dead in front of her, then brought her to a camp where she was held with other female captives and repeatedly raped for 10 days.

“Tell my story,” she said. “This is happening to women out there right now. I want this to end with me.”

A 28-year-old house cleaner said soldiers grabbed her from a street in Mekelle on the afternoon of Feb. 10 and took her to a field outside a military base where she was raped by more than 10 men wearing Ethiopian or Eritrean uniforms.

Wiping away tears, she said that during her two-week ordeal, soldiers doused her with alcohol and mocked her as they assaulted her. She escaped when her captors were distracted by gunfire, she said.

SHOT FOR RESISTING

The government has set up a task force separate from the human rights commission to investigate the reports of sexual violence. Its head, Mebrihit Assefa, said the body includes representatives from the regional health bureau, the attorney general’s office and federal police.

The task force plans to set up five centres where rape survivors can file reports with law enforcement and receive medical and psychosocial support.

“Our prosecutors (and) police officers are there to investigate all crimes committed, including sexual violence,” said Awol Sultan, a spokesman for the attorney general’s office.

He did not respond to questions about the women alleging they were raped during captivity, or whether prosecutors were in touch with either the Eritrean or Ethiopian militaries. The results of the criminal investigations will be released publicly at an unspecified date, he said.

Abera Nigus, the head of Tigray’s justice bureau, said the legal process was likely to be complicated because most courts are not functioning in Tigray, and many rape victims cannot identify their assailants.

Knowing their rapists are still at large also has discouraged women from seeking help, doctors said.

Many of the women who sought treatment at hospitals had vaginal and anal tears, sexually transmitted diseases and injuries that rendered them incontinent, said the Ayder hospital doctor, an obstetrician gynecologist. The doctor shared notes from 11 cases the hospital had treated involving women raped by soldiers.

One woman had been gang raped on three separate occasions, according to the hospital notes.

Another was five months pregnant when she was raped, the notes indicate. Two 14-year-old girls were sexually assaulted in front of their families. One girl had a hand and foot amputated.

She had been shot for resisting her assailant.

Eritrean forces have started withdrawing from the Tigray region in northern Ethiopia, the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said, following mounting reports blaming the Eritreans for human rights abuses including rape, looting and killings of civilians. Yahaira Jacquez reports. Reuters

An Auckland man has been charged with threatening to kill Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.

The 30-year-old man was arrested in south Auckland on Tuesday.

He was due to appear at Manukau District Court on Friday. If convicted, the offence could land him up to seven years in prison.

The man was also charged with harassing a man online “by sending constant social media messages, having already sent messages between December 2020 and March 2021”, knowing that the harassment was likely to cause the man to fear for his safety.

A police spokesman confirmed a person was arrested in the Counties Manukau police area after threats were allegedly made against an individual earlier this week.

This is not the first time threats have been made against Ardern.

In 2020, a man pleaded not guilty to a charge of sending threatening emails to Ardern between October 2019 and January 2020.

Court documents seen by Stuff allege Michael Christopher Cruickshank, sent three emails on January 21, having already sent 89 emails between October 2019 and January 2020. He is set to go on trial in May.

Qamishli (Syria) (AFP)

Kurdish authorities in northeast Syria on Sunday handed over 34 orphaned children, whose parents were suspected of belonging to the Islamic State group, to a Russian delegation to be repatriated.

An AFP correspondent in the city of Qamishli said the children aged between three and 14 were handed over to a delegation headed by the Russian president's envoy for children's rights, Anna Kuznetsova.

Moscow has now repatriated at least 169 such children, Fener al-Kait of the Syrian Kurds' foreign affairs department told AFP on the sidelines of a handover ceremony.

He said other departures to the Russian Federation of orphaned children would follow from northeast Syria.

Moscow has also been repatriating children abandoned in Iraq since the collapse of the jihadists' ""caliphate"" straddling both Arab states.

Syria's Kurds have repeatedly urged the international community to repatriate foreign nationals held in crowded camps in northeast Syria.

Their calls have largely fallen on deaf ears with only limited numbers, mostly children, allowed to return home so far.

I also call on Western govts who have outlawed any negative comment on the holocaust to use the same standards to penalise those deliberately spreading their message of hate against Muslims by abusing our Prophet PBUH. — Imran Khan (@ImranKhanPTI) April 17, 2021

The recent controversy began when the far-right Pakistan Islamist supremacist political party Tehreek-e-Labbaik began protests in Pakistan against France, which has told its citizens to flee the South Asian Islamic Republic.

cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });

if(window.location.pathname.indexOf(""656089"") != -1){console.log(""hedva connatix"");document.getElementsByClassName(""divConnatix"")[0].style.display =""none"";}

In a cycle that has now become common under many far-right Islamist regimes, whenever an extremist group claims it is “offended” by a Western country, it lashes out at Jews and the Holocaust.In the latest incident, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan compared “negative comments on the Holocaust” to “abuse of our Prophet” and called on Western countries to make criticism of the Prophet illegal. Khan doesn’t actually condemn Holocaust denial; he has met with leading Holocaust denier Mahathir Mohamad, the former prime minister of Malaysia.The attacks on France are entirely invented and are commonly used in Muslim countries that have far-right governments to encourage extremism. For instance, Turkey also attacked France last year, claiming it had “insulted the Prophet,” which led to several terrorist attacks in France.Last October, a student in a French school lied to her classmates , claiming a teacher had “insulted” Islam. The teacher was beheaded.In response to the beheading, rather than condemn the attack, Turkey mobilized its extremists to attack France. Anti-French riots and protests occurred around the Muslim world under the entirely false claim that the “Prophet had been insulted.”To get back at France, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan slammed the Holocaust last year. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah also used Holocaust denial last year to get back at France for not being “sensitive” to religious feelings. France had prosecuted “philosopher Roger Garaudy, who wrote a book questioning the myths of the so-called Holocaust,” he said.“Muslims have a right to be angry and to kill millions of French people,” said Malaysia’s Mahathir, a former guest at Oxford, Cambridge and Columbia University, where his denials and antisemitic comments have been indulged.Iran’s regime has also pushed Holocaust denial to get back at Europe for insults to Muslims. In 2006, it hosted a Holocaust-denial cartoon contest in revenge for cartoons against Islam in Denmark.Now the cycle has begun again. Every time far-right Islamists are angry at Europe for insults, it is the Holocaust that has to be brought up. Most far-right Islamist groups, rooted in the Muslim Brotherhood, openly deny the Holocaust.Imran Khan, a former cricket champion who was once married to a woman who was part Jewish, didn’t actually acknowledge Holocaust denial in his tweet. He wrote: “I also call on Western govts who have outlawed any negative comment on the holocaust to use the same standards to penalise those deliberately spreading their message of hate against Muslims by abusing our Prophet PBUH [peace be upon him].”The tone of his tweet, like comments by other far-right Islamist leaders, is to try to minimize the Holocaust – as he says, “negative comments about the Holocaust” – to get back at European governments. European countries and their collaborators carried out the Holocaust; the same countries today are the ones where there are sometimes cartoons offensive to Muslims.It is unclear why the Islamist far Right, which denies the Holocaust at home, always seeks to bring it up whenever they are offended by the same Western countries where the Holocaust took place.These countries, such as Pakistan, outlaw blasphemy at home but do not outlaw or ban Holocaust denial. They claim it is hypocritical of some European countries that ban Holocaust denial to not ban offensive comments about Muslims.However, they don’t argue that they should also ban Holocaust denial in Iran, Turkey, Pakistan and Malaysia. Rather, they claim Holocaust denial is “free speech” at home.Malaysia’s former leader, for instance, was invited to many leading Western universities to push Holocaust denial. “Why is it I can’t say something against the Jews?” he asked at Columbia University. He wanted his “free speech” to attack Jews and the Holocaust, but then he complains about “free speech” in places like France that enables cartoons insulting the Prophet.None of the leaders, including Khan, Mahathir, Erdogan and Ahmadinejad, argued that Holocaust denial should be banned in their countries as well as blasphemy. Instead, their argument is that blasphemy should be banned in Europe and that they should have a right to free speech denying the Holocaust.In general, the cycle of these groups is to encourage Holocaust denial the more they see offensive comments against Islam in Europe. This doesn’t hurt the feelings of most people in Europe. Rather, it targets Jews. This is because these groups are systemically anti-Jewish, and their interest is not to hurt the feelings of Europeans in revenge for hurt feelings regarding their faith, but rather to justify hating Jews as a response.Pakistan’s Khan claimed that extremists in Europe had indulged in Islamophobia and racist slurs “to hurt and cause pain to 1.3 billion Muslims.” The response: Attack the Holocaust, which extremists in Europe did to six million Jews.How reducing respect for the Holocaust gets back at France or Europeans, where Holocaust denial originated, is unclear.None of the far-right Muslim leaders have ever acknowledged the Holocaust and given respect to Jews, Jewish suffering or the genocide of Jews. They use hatred of Jews to respond to European insults against Islam.Pakistan claims that insults to Islam are tantamount to Holocaust denial, but it doesn’t ban Holocaust denial. The only time Khan has mentioned the Holocaust is to get back at France and inflame his base at home, not to acknowledge it.",952,6270,8,69

Four people were killed and 20 wounded in a car bomb attack on Thursday in the Sadr City neighbourhood of Baghdad, Iraqi police and medical workers said.

The car was parked at a busy second-hand equipment market in the mainly Shi'ite Muslim district, police said.

An Iraqi military statement said the blast had killed one civilian, wounded 12 others and set several vehicles on fire. A second statement by the military said only one person, the driver, had died. Medics in Sadr City put the death toll at four.

Black smoke rose from the market place after the blast and ambulances rushed to save the wounded, Reuters witnesses said. Police cordoned off the site of the blast shortly afterwards.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. It was the second big deadly bombing to hit Baghdad this year after a suicide attack claimed by Islamic State militants killed at least 32 people in a crowded market in January.

Large bomb attacks, once an almost daily occurrence in the Iraqi capital, have halted in recent years since Islamic State fighters were defeated in 2017, part of an overall improvement in security that has brought normal life back to Baghdad.

The January blast was the most deadly in three years.

Thursday's attack comes during an election year, a time when tension between rival Iraqi political groups has often caused violence.

The populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, after whom Sadr city is named and who commands a following of millions of Iraqis, counts among his enemies both Islamic State and rival Shi'ite parties with militias backed by Iran.

On Wednesday, separate violence linked to regional rivalries saw an explosives-laden drone target U.S. forces at Iraq's Erbil airport in northern Iraq and a separate rocket attack kill a Turkish soldier at a military base nearby. read more

Restrictions on business and movement have been in place for most of this year in Italy, which has the seventh highest death toll in the world and still reports hundreds of fatalities every day.

Current restrictions were set to expire at the start of May, and no decision had been taken on how to replace them.

Prime Minister Mario Draghi set out a broad timetable for reopening after pressure from parties in his national unity administration, particularly the rightist League.

""The government is taking a reasonable risk based on data that is improving, although not dramatically,"" Draghi told a news conference.

Last month, with cases and hospitalisations rising, Italy paused the four-tier, colour-coded system it uses to calibrate the restrictions in place in its 20 regions and enforced the tougher red or orange zones nationwide.

From April 26, the more lenient yellow and white zones will be reinstated where infection levels are low. In these areas restaurants and bars will be able to serve clients at outside tables and cinemas and theatres will reopen with attendance limits.

""Our idea is to allow open-air swimming pools from May 15 and restart some gym activities on June 1,"" Health Minister Roberto Speranza told reporters.

Currently, three regions are red and 17 are orange, with severe restrictions on business and movement. With the number of new cases gradually declining, many of these hope to become yellow when the colour zone is reinstated.

Draghi said it would be crucial that people strictly respected social distancing rules and wore face masks to move forward with the reopenings.

""This is based on a premise, that people and institutions observe the rules so that this reasonable risk is successful,"" he said.

United States President Joe Biden has signed an executive order that imposes a slate of new sanctions against Russia, as well as expelling 10 diplomats from the US, in response to a massive Russian hacking campaign that breached vital federal agencies, as well as for election interference.

President Biden said he warned Russia President Vladimir Putin about the sanctions when they spoke by telephone in a “candid, respectful conversation” on April 13.

“I was clear with President Putin that we could have gone further, but I chose not to do so. I chose to be proportionate,” Biden said in remarks at the White House on Thursday.

“The United States is not looking to kick-off a cycle of escalation and conflict with Russia. We want a stable, predictable relationship,” the US president said.

The sanctions, foreshadowed for weeks by the US administration, represent the first retaliatory action announced against the Kremlin for last year’s hack, familiarly known as the SolarWinds breach.

In that intrusion, Russian hackers are believed to have infected widely used software with malicious code, enabling them to access the networks of at least nine agencies in what US officials believe was an intelligence-gathering operation aimed at mining government secrets.

The order “sends a signal that the United States will impose costs in a strategic and economically impactful manner on Russia if it continues or escalates its destabilizing international actions,” the White House said in a statement.

“Our objective here is not to escalate, our objective here is to impose costs for what we feel are unacceptable actions by the Russian government,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Thursday. “We still believe that when there’s unacceptable behaviour, we should put consequences in place.”

Besides that hack, US officials last month alleged that Russian President Vladimir Putin authorised influence operations to help former US President Donald Trump in his unsuccessful bid for re-election, although there’s no evidence that Russia or anyone else changed votes or manipulated the outcome.

Russia has denied involvement in both the SolarWinds hack and the election meddling.

The White House on Thursday said the most recent punitive actions were also motivated by Moscow “targeting dissidents or journalists” and the undermining of “security in countries and regions important to the United States national security”, apparent references to the alleged Russian nerve-agent attack on opposition leader Alexey Navalny and a recent build-up of troops along the border of Ukraine.

Biden did not mention Navalny’s imprisonment in his remarks at the White House on Thursday but said he had warned Putin to refrain from any military action in Ukraine and Crimea. “Now is the time to de-escalate,” Biden said.

The US president reiterated he has invited the Russian leader to a summit meeting to be held in Europe that would allow the two world powers to engage in direct talks on arms control and security issues including Iran and North Korea.

“My hope and expectation is we’ll be able to work out a modus vivendi,” Biden said, emphasizing the US’s “unwavering” support for allies and partners in Europe. Ukraine is not a NATO ally but has been receiving US military and financial support.

Today, the United States took far-reaching action against the Russian Government in response to its harmful acts. We will continue to hold Russia to account for its adversarial actions. — Secretary Antony Blinken (@SecBlinken) April 15, 2021

In its statement on Thursday, the administration also referenced a CIA assessment that Russia offered to pay bounties to members of the Taliban in Afghanistan to target US troops, saying that due to the “sensitivity of this matter”, the response is being handled through diplomatic, military and intelligence channels.

Speaking to CNN before the announcement, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan called the actions “proportionate measures to defend American interests in response to harmful Russian actions including cyber intrusions and election interference”.

“[Biden’s] goal is to provide a significant and credible response but not to escalate the situation. He believes that the United States and Russia can have a stable and predictable relationship,” said Sullivan, adding that the administration is calling on Putin to discuss the issues at a summit proposed by Biden in a phone call with the Russian leader on Tuesday.

The measures announced Thursday include sanctions on six Russian companies that support the country’s cyber activities, in addition to sanctions on 32 individuals and entities accused of attempting to interfere in last year’s presidential election, including by spreading disinformation.

The 10 diplomats being expelled include representatives of Russian intelligence services, the White House said.

It was not immediately clear what, if any, other actions might be planned, with officials previously saying they expected to take actions both “seen and unseen”.

Measures ‘in no way help’

Before the official announcement, the Kremlin on Thursday said the actions would make a possible Biden-Putin summit more difficult.

“What is currently being discussed – likely sanctions – will in no way help such a meeting. That is unambiguous,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday.

The Kremlin also summoned US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan on Wednesday and told him that Washington must refrain from introducing new sanctions on Russia if it wants to mend ties, a Russian foreign ministry spokesperson told AFP.

In their call on Tuesday, Biden and Putin had said they would “continue dialogue”, after ties plummeted when the US president caused an uproar in Moscow last month by agreeing with a description of his Russian counterpart as a “killer”.

Still, it remained unclear whether the US actions would actually result in changed behaviour, especially since past measures by the US have failed to bring an end to Russian hacking.

The administration of former US President Barack Obama expelled diplomats from the US in 2016 in response to interference in that year’s presidential election.

Although Trump was often reluctant to criticise Putin, his administration also expelled diplomats in 2018 for Russia’s alleged poisoning of an ex-intelligence officer in the United Kingdom.

Meanwhile, US officials continue to grapple with the aftereffects of the SolarWinds intrusion, which affected agencies including the Treasury, Justice, Energy and Homeland Security departments, and are still assessing what information may have been stolen. The breach exposed vulnerabilities in the supply chain as well as weaknesses in the federal government’s own cyber defenses.

The planned actions represent the second major round of sanctions imposed by the Biden administration against Russia.",1088,7030,8,52

The couple decided to investigate the possibility of making a vaccine for that mysterious and highly contagious virus using mRNA. Within weeks, BioNTech scientists developed an experimental vaccine in partnership with American pharma giant Pfizer. And 10 months later, the vaccine cleared clinical trials and regulatory hurdles and began going into tens of millions of people’s arms around the world.

For Şahin and Türeci, it’s time to pick up the cancer research where it’s left.

“We have several different cancer vaccines based on mRNA,” Türeci told The Associated Press in an interview on Friday. Though it’s too early to predict when such a vaccine will be available, the prospect is promising. “It’s very difficult to predict in innovative development. But we expect that within only a couple of years,” Türeci added.

The biotech community has been studying mRNA for two decades. The medical platform works by carrying instructions for making antigen proteins found on the surface of a virus into body cells. The antigen will then be copied and produced in more cells to prime the immune system against that specific virus.

The same principle can be applied in tackling other immune system-related illnesses, such as influenza, malaria and cancer.

For cancer, mRNA is being investigated as a way to deliver to cells the protein codes in a specific tumor, which could be personalized to match an individual’s cancer mutations. The cells then produce those proteins and train the immune system to guard off the cancer.

Boston-based Moderna, which developed an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine in a similar record time, is also investigating the tech’s potential in treating and preventing other diseases. The firm has 24 mRNA-based vaccines or therapies in the works, including three vaccine projects announced in January: one for HIV, one for seasonal flu, and the third Nipah virus, which causes encephalitis and has a fatality rate of up to 75 percent.

On Friday, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier awarded Şahin and Türeci with the Order of Merit, one of the country’s highest honors, during a ceremony attended by Chancellor Angela Merkel.

The couple stressed that success with BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine is a team effort. “It’s about the effort of many: our team at BioNTech, all the partners who were involved, also governments, regulatory authorities, which worked together with a sense of urgency,” Türeci said. “The way we see it, this is an acknowledgement of this effort and also a celebration of science.”",458,2861,14,81

1,God finally gives a shout-out back...,https://www.theonion.com/god-finally-gives-shout-out-back-to-all-his-niggaz-1819566159,"SOUTH BRONX, NY—The Lord Almighty finally responded to nearly two decades of praise in hip-hop album liner notes Monday, when He gave a shout-out back to all His loyal niggaz.

Rappers Method Man and Redman give big ups to God (inset).

""Right about now, I want to send a shout-out to each and every nigga who's shown Me love through the years,"" said the Lord, His booming voice descending from Heaven. ""I got mad love for each and every one of you niggaz. Y'all real niggaz out there, you know who you are. Y'all was there for me, and it's about time I'm-a give some love back to God's true crew.""

""All y'all niggaz, y'all be My niggaz,"" the Lord added.

As of press time, God has thanked nearly 7,000 of His niggaz, including those in New York's Bad Boy and Ruff Ryders posses, the No Limit soldiers and Cash Money Millionaires holdin' it down in New Orleans, Nelly and the whole St. Lunatics crew, Busta and the rest of the Flipmode Squad, His peeps from back in the day, and all the real ruffneck niggaz in lockdown. He also sent shout-outs to everybody in the Old School, as well as to Lil' Bow Wow and all the other new niggaz just coming up.

""Mad props to P. Diddy, Jay-Z, DMX, Lil' Kim, Mystikal, Eve, Ja Rule, Jadakiss, Trick Daddy, and Xzibit. And one love to Meth, RZA, GZA, Ghostface, and the rest of My real niggaz in the Wu-Tang Clan,"" the deity said. ""These My beloved niggaz, with whom I be well-pleased.""

Now nearing the 48-hour mark, the Lord's first-ever reciprocal shout-out shows little sign of slowing down. Based on estimates of the number of rappers who have thanked Him in liner notes over the past 20 years, hip-hop experts say the historic shout-out is likely to continue through early next week.

A pair of shout-out tablets handed down by the Lord.

In addition to rap's current stars, God offered shout-outs to the original hip-hop heads, including such pioneers of the art form as Grandmaster Flash, Busy Bee, Melle Mel, Jazzy Jay, Kool Moe Dee, Afrika Bambaataa, DJ Red Alert, the Cold Crush Brothers, Fab 5 Freddy, Kurtis Blow, Kool Herc, and the Funky 4+1.

God also offered shout-outs to the many DJs, record labels, magazines, TV shows, and radio stations that have tirelessly supported hip-hop over the years. Among them are Def Jam, Tommy Boy, Jive, Roc-A-Fella, Rap Pages, The Source, Right On!, The Box, Funkmaster Flex, Ed Lover and Dr. Dre, WBLS 107.5, KISS-FM, and Hot 97.

""For supporting the many artists who have supported Me so faithfully, I say thank you,"" God said. ""All praise to Devante Harrell, Wanda Simmons, LaShell Thomas, and everybody else at Uptown/MCA for making this possible.""

As a further sign of His love for the hip-hop community, God assured the nation's rappers that He is taking good care of all their peers currently with Him in heaven.

""Tupac, Notorious B.I.G., Eazy-E, Scott LaRock—some of y'all niggaz are already up in this bitch,"" the Lord said. ""For those of you who were left behind, know that the Lord has got your dead homies' backs. Faith [Evans], I promise I'm taking real good care of your Biggie. He resting in crazy peace, no doubt.""

Thus far, God has not played favorites, thanking such fallen-off acts as Hammer and Vanilla Ice in the same breath as vital artists whose careers are still going strong. The Lord has also seen fit to thank the little-known likes of Baby Tragic, DJ Phreek Malik, and Da Ill Collector—MCs so obscure that virtually no one within the hip-hop community has heard of them. All rappers, God explained, are equal in His sight, and none are too small to escape His notice.

""God sees even the smallest sparrow fall,"" said Dr. Cornel West, Harvard University professor of African-American studies and philosophy of religion. ""The same is true of MCs: Whether a major superstar or a complete unknown, all rappers are His children, and He loves them all.""

The sheer volume of names notwithstanding, the nation's rappers are deeply touched by God's gesture of tribute and appreciation, with many stating that they ""feelin' Him.""

""God is the Original,"" Brooklyn-based rapper Mos Def said. ""The world is ruled by the wealthy and the wicked, but all respect due to the Creator who made this world and who will one day bring justice to the wicked and righteous alike.""

Despite the overwhelmingly positive response among rappers, the Lord is drawing fire in certain circles for His use of the word ""nigga."" On Monday's Larry King Live, conservative activist Rev. Calvin Butts, a longtime ally of the Lord, blasted Him for His ""shocking, unexpected use of the racially loaded N-word."" Some concerned parties, including decency crusader C. Delores Tucker, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), and members of the San Francisco-based What About The Children? Foundation, are calling for a boycott of church services until God issues an apology.

Reacting to the controversy, many in the hip-hop community are rushing to the Lord's defense.

""The word 'nigga' means different things depending on how it's used and who's saying it,"" rap legend and Public Enemy frontman Chuck D said. ""Judging from context, God obviously wasn't being derogatory. He was using 'nigga' as a blanket term of affection for all His true supporters on the rap scene. At one point, He said, 'I wanna give a shout-out to Ad-Rock, MC Serch, and my man Dan The Automator—all y'all is real niggaz in My all-benevolent sight.' Considering the fact that Ad-Rock and Serch are Jewish, and the Automator is Asian-American, it's clear God isn't talking about race here. He's just paying respect to all those who have paid respect to Him.""

""God's the ultimate playa, so naturally He's going to have some haters,"" rapper Ice Cube said. ""But these haters need to realize that if you mess with the man upstairs, you will get your ass smote. True dat.""",1009,5925,6,37

TOKYO (Reuters) -International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach will visit Japan in May, the Kyodo News agency said on Saturday, as the nation struggles to contain a surge in COVID-19 cases before the start of the Games.

Bach will attend a torch relay ceremony in the western city of Hiroshima on May 17 and meet with Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga the next day, Kyodo said, citing sources close to the matter. Bach is expected to back Japan's commitment to safely host the Summer Games, Kyodo reported.

""We are aware of President Bach's intention to come to Japan and would welcome such a visit,"" the Tokyo Olympic organising committee said in a statement. ""However, nothing concrete has been decided.""

With fewer than 100 days until the Olympics are due to start in Tokyo, Japan expanded quasi-emergency measures to 10 regions on Friday as a fourth wave of COVID-19 cases spread.

Suga, who is on a state visit to the United States, said at a news conference on Friday that he told President Joe Biden he was committed to moving forward with the Games and that Biden offered his support.

0,Xinjiang cotton boycott leaves Western brands reeling,https://www.dw.com/en/xinjiang-cotton-boycott-leaves-western-brands-reeling/a-57130450,"The latest China-versus-the-West dispute is getting ugly. On Wednesday, Chinese state television started blurring the names of Western brands worn by reality show contestants. The measure was a veiled threat to the likes of Adidas and Nike that they could easily lose access to the world's largest consumer market of 1.4 billion people.

Why? The brands have taken a stand on the sourcing of apparel made with cotton produced in China's western Xinjiang region. Human rights groups allege that the fiber is picked using forced labor by the country's Uyghur Muslim population.

They accuse China of holding up to 1 million Uyghurs in internment camps, which prompted Western sanctions on Chinese officials and new US legislation, enacted in January, that limits the import of Xinjiang cotton. Beijing, however, insists the camps are vocational training centers needed to fight extremism.

H&M, Nike feel the heat

The world's second-largest clothing retailer, H&M, was among the first to be caught in the fray. Amid accusations that it was profiting from modern-day slavery, the Swedish multinational promised last year to stop buying cotton from Xinjiang.

But it now faces a backlash from Chinese consumers who threatened their own boycott of H&M products. Nike, Adidas and Hugo Boss have also been targeted on social media and several Chinese celebrities have cut ties with Western brands.

""The backlash is driven by nationalist sentiment, amplified by Chinese state media, and is being used to retaliate against increasing international scrutiny on the genocide that is happening in Xinjiang,"" Johnson Yeung, urgent appeal coordinator for Clean Clothes Campaign East Asia told DW. He noted that social media is heavily controlled and censored by the Chinese government.

Indeed, the Biden administration last month denounced what it said was Beijing's ""state-led social media campaign and corporate and consumer boycott against companies.""

Beijing has warned foreign companies against interfering in its domestic affairs

Principles over profit?

The same brands that have won support among Western consumers in recent years for taking a stand on social issues, like equality and human rights, are now up against more hardline belief-based buyers in China, who see the cotton boycott as threatening the country's reputation.

China — already an important market for many international brands — is set to become even more critical to their bottom line. Domestic Chinese consumption is expected to double by 2030, according to Morgan Stanley, to reach $12.7 trillion (€10.7 trillion) — roughly the same as US consumers spend today. So Western brands may have to walk a thin line to appease both sides in this dispute. And that's led to rather contradictory messaging from some retailers.

German fashion brand Hugo Boss insists on its corporate website that it doesn't buy any goods directly from Xinjiang. However, on the Weibo social media platform, the firm told Chinese consumers that ""Xinjiang long cotton is one of the best in the world, we believe quality raw materials would show its value. We will continue to buy and support Xinjiang cotton."" The message was later deleted.

H&M, meanwhile, facing the removal of its productions from Chinese e-commerce platforms, was forced to downplay its criticism of Beijing's treatment of Uyghur Muslims. In a recent statement, it declared that China was a ""very important market"" and vowed to ""regain the trust and confidence"" of customers, colleagues, and business partners in the country.

Beijing turns the screws

This is not the first time that China has pressured foreign brands to conform to its position on sensitive issues. Western fashion firms and automakers were forced to apologize two years ago for implying that Hong Kong and Taiwan are independent countries.

Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997 by colonial ruler Britain under the one country, two systems model, while Beijing sees Taiwan as its territory. Other brands have run into similar trouble for remarks about Tibet.

To date, sanctions by the United States, the European Union and the UK on Chinese officials over human rights abuses against the Uyghurs have only spurred tit-for-tat measures from Beijing. China this week threatened Japan and Australia with retaliation if they join other countries in imposing punitive measures.

China, meanwhile, has warned multinational firms not to engage in politics over Xinjiang. Xu Guixiang, a Xinjiang government spokesman, said their interference was ""like lifting a stone to drop it on one's own feet.""

H&M and others have been pilloried in China for statements voicing concern about allegations of forced labor

Opaque supply chains

The New York Times reported Tuesday that while many retailers had vowed to stop using Xinjiang cotton, their promises might be difficult to uphold.

China exports unprocessed cotton to more than a dozen countries, including the world's other biggest apparel producers. The newspaper described how the Chinese government restricted access to supply chains in its far-western region, which would likely hamper efforts for auditors to ensure that products were free of Xinjiang-sourced cotton.

Yeung from Clean Clothes Campaign East Asia told DW that a successful Western boycott relied on apparel producers' ""willingness to eradicate forced labor."" He pointed to Dutch clothing brand We Fashion that he said had committed to ending the use of Xinjiang cotton, although the company did not have stores in China. British retailer M&S had also backed the call to stop forced labor, he said.

""Given the intense authoritarian control in China, we have to maintain the pressure for a long time,"" he conceded.",899,5716,7,53

The allegation will raise fresh fears over the use of the Chinese company's technology in mobile networks around the world.

The report said: ""The continued existence of KPN Mobile is in serious danger because permits may be revoked or the government and businesses may give up their confidence in KPN if it becomes known that the Chinese government can eavesdrop on KPN mobile numbers and shut down the network.""

The report also found Huawei staff had the ability to decipher which numbers were tapped by Dutch police and intelligence services.

At the time of the security flaw, KPN's network had already been warned by the domestic security service AIVD about the risks of working with Huawei.

Picture taken January 25, 2018. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo

Over 400 financial firms in Britain have shifted activities, staff and a combined trillion pounds ($1.4 trillion) in assets to hubs in the European Union due to Brexit, with more pain to come, a study from New Financial think tank said on Friday.

""We think it is an underestimate and we expect the numbers to increase over time: we are only at the end of the beginning of Brexit,"" the study said.

The EU has offered Britain little in the way of direct market access for financial services, which were not included in the bloc's trade deal with the United Kingdom from January.

""That access is unlikely to be forthcoming, so it is perhaps better for the industry to take the damage from Brexit on the chin and focus instead on recalibrating the framework in the UK so that it is more tailored to the unique nature of the UK financial services industry,"" the study said.

Some 7,400 jobs have moved from Britain or been created at new hubs in the EU, the study said. Bankers have told Reuters that some staff moves have been delayed due to COVID-19 travel restrictions.

The total of 440 relocations is higher than anticipated and well above the 269 in New Financial's 2019 survey. New Financial believes the real number is well over 500.

DUBLIN WINNER

Dublin has emerged as the biggest beneficiary with 135 relocations, followed by Paris with 102, Luxembourg 95, Frankfurt 63, and Amsterdam 48.

""This redistribution of activity across the EU has wound the clock back by about 20 years,"" the study said.

Banks have moved or are moving over 900 billion pounds in assets from Britain to the EU, while insurers and asset managers have transferred over 100 billion pounds in assets and funds, reducing the UK tax base.

""We expect Frankfurt will be the 'winner' in terms of assets in the longer-term, and that Paris will ultimately be the biggest beneficiary in terms of jobs,"" the study said.

Amsterdam toppling London as Europe's biggest share trading centre since January has been the most visible sign of Brexit in finance.

The study expects that 300 to 500 smaller EU financial firms may open a permanent office in Britain, far fewer than the prevailing forecasts of around 1,000.

The City of London will remain the dominant financial centre in Europe for the foreseeable future, but its influence will be chipped away, risking a reduction in Britain's 26 billion pounds annual trade surplus in financial services with the EU, the study added.

0,Berlin rent cap overturned by Germany's top court: Germany's constitutional court has decided that the Berlin rent cap violates Germany's constitution. The cap was one of the most-debated laws in the country,https://www.dw.com/en/berlin-rent-cap-overturned-by-germanys-top-court/a-57209268,"Germany's constitutional court in Karlsruhe has ruled that the Berlin state government had no right to impose a rent cap in the German capital.

The court ruling found that since the federal government had already made a law regulating rents, a state government could not impose its own law that infringed upon that, and said the Berlin rent cap law was therefore null and void.

Today was a ""heavy day for renters in Berlin,"" said Sebastian Scheel, Berlin's minister for urban development and housing, of the socialist Left party. ""We took this path for good reasons,"" he told the taz newspaper. ""We knew that we were treading new ground, and wanted to sound out this issue of jurisdiction.""

He also promised that the government would step in to help tenants who would now potentially be hit by sudden rent hikes. A demonstration calling for major property-owning companies to be expropriated was called on Thursday evening.

The Berlin Tenants' Association called Thursday's ruling a ""slap in the face"" for all tenants. ""To declare the law unconstitutional from the beginning is irresponsible social policy,"" the association's director Reiner Wild said in a statement, before noting that it contradicted several other court rulings.

The constitutional complaint had been brought in May 2020 by Bundestag parliamentarians from the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the pro-business Free Democratic Party (FDP), who both welcomed the decision on Thursday.

Kai Wegner, a spokesman for the CDU federal parliamentary group, called the decision a ""sensitive defeat"" for the Berlin government, who he blamed for making ""a false rent cap promise"" to the city's renters.

""The damage is great,"" he said in a statement. ""Ideology solves no problems, not in the housing market either. In the long-term, only a sufficient supply of housing can secure affordable rents.""

But the Berlin government had called the rent cap a ""breathing space"" for tenants while new housing could be built.

Soaring rents

Berlin's rent cap meant that rents for 90% of Berlin's apartments were frozen for five years at their June 2019 level. New rents could not go above that level, and as of November 2020, any existing rents that were still above that level had to be reduced.

In Berlin tenants had long been protesting gentrification and rent hikes

The Berlin rent cap has been one of the most debated laws in Germany over the past few years.

Campaigners argued it was a vital way to preserve affordable housing in the German capital, where rents have been soaring for years. The German Property Foundation (ZIA) calculated last year that rents in new contracts in the city had risen 27% from 2013 to 2019 alone.

The federal government imposed a ""rent brake"" in 2015, which allowed landlords to raise rents by 10% above the local market level. According to the constitutional court, the existence of this law among others meant that Berlin could not impose its own regulation.

Since the rent cap came into effect on February 23, 2020, it has caused uncertainty in the German capital's housing market, largely because landlords took to putting a ""shadow rent"" — higher rents that tenants would have to pay in case the court found the rent cap unconstitutional — in their rental contracts.

Renters associations have called these shadow rents unlawful.

Thursday's decision could mean a windfall for landlords as rents are instantly raised by hundreds of euros a month, on top of which landlords could now demand their tenants back-pay higher rents for the past year.

International implications

International campaigners saw the Berlin rent cap as one of the most radical rent control measures worldwide, because though other European countries and cities have introduced rent freezes, the Berlin law allowed tenants to actually sue their landlords to reduce their rents.

Barbara Steenbergen, EU liaison head of the International Union of Tenants (IUT), said she was shocked by the German court decision, not least because other state-level in Berlin laws did in fact regulate regulate private property rights: There is a law that bans landlords from keeping property empty as a speculation, for instance.

Steenbergen said that the Berlin state government had been forced to act because the federal government's rent control measures, the rent brake, had not slowed the capital's spiraling rents.

She also expressed some hope for other tenants' campaigns in other countries. ""This decision is not about whether the rent cap is good or bad, it is purely about jurisdiction,"" she told DW. ""So now what legislators in the rest of Europe have to check is: What is actually the jurisdiction that you have – in order to avoid possible mistakes like in Berlin.""

Balakrishnan Rajagopal, UN's special rapporteur on the right to housing, told DW he was concerned that that the ruling could have a negative impact for Berlin and other cities struggling with an affordability crisis: ""The impact of the ruling could be quite severe on renters in Berlin and elsewhere.""

""My main concern is that this particular ruling could affect the ability of the Berlin government, as well as the federal government, to ensure that housing remains affordable.""

There is interest in ""the influence that Germany's record will have on other countries that are also facing similar crises of affordability in other large global cities like Berlin around the world — how will it [the ruling] affect their ability to control the problem of affordability.""

He warned that the position of the court ""shut down"" and ""discouraged"" the efforts by the Berlin government to implement affordable housing. He added: ""that sends a negative message around the world, unfortunately, and that is why I'm quite concerned.""

NEW DELHI: An alarming spike in COVID-19 cases has created a crisis across India, particularly in the capital, New Delhi, recording more than 25,000 cases — about one in three of those tested — in the past 24 hours, according to official data.

The situation in New Delhi, which has a population of more than 20 million people, forced Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to write to the federal government seeking more hospital beds. Several health care facilities have said they can no longer accommodate patients, leading to a rise in fatalities due to lack of space, oxygen cylinders and drugs.

“The situation in Delhi is very grim,” Kejriwal wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

He asked the PM to “earmark 7,000 beds out of 10,000 in the federal government-run hospitals in Delhi” for COVID-19 patients to “tide over the crisis.”

“There is an acute dearth of oxygen in Delhi, and it should be supplied immediately,” Kejriwal added.

On Sunday, India registered a record single-day rise of 261,500 coronavirus infections taking the nationwide case total to almost 1.48 million.

More than 1,500 people died from the coronavirus disease on Sunday alone, another record for the nation of 1.39 billion, bringing the national toll to 177,168 deaths.

Several residents in New Delhi said that most private and government hospitals had run out of beds with many patients desperate to get admitted to hospital.

“Since yesterday evening I have been trying to admit my sister in a hospital but seven or eight hospitals I reached refused admission,” Tabish Jamal, a Delhi resident, told Arab News on Sunday.

“My sister’s oxygen level is dipping, and she needs immediate medical intervention, but it’s a grim scenario. We are so helpless,” she said, adding that “a small nursing home with basic facilities” had admitted her sister, but “we are getting desperate.”

Lucknow, the capital of the eastern state of Uttar Pradesh, is also facing a bleak scenario with media reports saying that people were “waiting in hordes to be admitted to hospitals,” with at least 50 seen queueing outside the King George’s Medical University, the city’s main facility.

“It’s a grim scenario in the city and around Lucknow,” Kulsum Mustafa, a senior journalist in Lucknow, said on Sunday.

She accused the government of “hiding the exact figures and not showing the true picture.”

“The fact is that there is not only an acute shortage of beds and oxygen, but the testing facilities are minimal too,” Mustafa said.

India’s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh reported close to 27,550 cases on Sunday making it the second-worst affected area, after the western state of Maharashtra, which had registered more than 67,000 patients in the past 24 hours.

Meanwhile, in the western state of Gujarat, which is PM Modi’s home state, officials reported scenes of “chaos at most hospitals” in the capital city of Ahmedabad.

“Ahmedabad city, like other places in India, is facing a shortage of oxygen, hospital beds and important medicines such as Remdesivir,” Dr. Mona Desai, chief of Ahmedabad Medical Association, said on Sunday.

“With the new variant of coronavirus, the oxygen level starts to dip very soon, and the state is not prepared to supply oxygen to all. The timely intervention of oxygen is important; otherwise, vital organs fail,” she added.

On Sunday, Gujarat registered nearly 10,000 cases, which Desai said is “not the real figure.”

“The death toll is high this time, but the government data is not showing that. I don’t know why they hide the data.”

Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said that the “oxygen production is being doubled.”

“Oxygen production is being diverted from industrial to medical use. The center is providing additional ventilators to the states,” he told a press conference on Sunday.

He said that Maharashtra, with Mumbai as its capital, would get 1,121 ventilators, Uttar Pradesh 1,700, Jharkhand 1,500, Gujarat 1,600, Madhya Pradesh 152 and Chhattisgarh 230.

Experts and medical practitioners, however, questioned the “sincerity of the government” in fighting the pandemic.”

“It’s more than one year, and the government is not ready to face the challenges posed by a coronavirus,” Mustafa said, adding before questioning the “rationale of allowing the Hindu festival Kumbh to take place in this year.”

The Kumbh Mela is a month-long festival that takes place once every 12 years, with organizers expecting a footfall of 150 million Hindus — equivalent to the population of Russia — to converge on the northern state of Uttarakhand for a ritual dip in holy waters at four dedicated sites this year.

So far, 5 million people have visited the sacred sites since the festival began on April 1.",783,4788,9,65

Enlarge this image toggle caption Ramon Espinosa/AP Ramon Espinosa/AP

A generation of Cuban revolutionaries who seized power more than six decades ago, directly challenging the U.S. and later pushing Washington and Moscow to the brink of nuclear war, is set to exit the stage.

At a party conference that started Friday, 89-year-old Raúl Castro, the brother of the late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro, said he will step down as head of the Cuban Communist Party. Three years ago, he resigned the presidency and handed the reins to a much younger Miguel Mario Díaz-Canel Bermúdez.

The move, at Cuba's Eighth Party Congress, will mark the first time since the 1959 communist revolution that a Castro will not hold one of the most powerful roles in Cuba's government.

It also comes on the symbolic 60th anniversary of the failed Bay of Pigs, a CIA-led operation to use Cuban exiles in an invasion that sought to overthrow the communist regime. The following year, American spy planes discovered evidence that Soviet-supplied, nuclear-armed missiles were being installed on the island — leading to a showdown between the U.S. and the Soviet Union that many historians regard as the closest the superpowers ever came to a full-scale conflict.

But those events will likely dim as the country's ""historic generation,"" as many Cubans refer to the old guard, also fade. On Friday, Castro's longtime deputy, 90-year-old José Ramón Machado Ventura, is also expected to step down, leaving the 17-member Politburo without any revolutionary veterans.

Many Cubans who don't remember a time when a Castro wasn't running their daily affairs are nervous about the future, especially since the transition comes as the country appears to be at a crossroads.

Following the end of the Cold War, Moscow's patronage all but dried up, leaving Cuba to find new benefactors. After a glimmer of rapprochement between Havana and Washington during the Obama administration, the Trump White House did an about-face, imposing U.S. sanctions.

The sanctions — together with the loss of support from Venezuela and spiraling inflation — has brought a return to food shortages not seen since the 1990s. More recently, the isolated communist government has had to face the coronavirus pandemic, which, among other things, has meant going it alone on vaccine development.

President Biden has said he wants a reset on Cuba policy but so far has offered few details on how his administration will handle the perennially thorny issue.

After Raúl Castro took over for his brother in 2008, he brought big economic changes to the island – expanding private enterprise, ushering in the use of cellphones, allowing access to the Internet and seeking more relaxed relations with the United States.

But since then, reforms have mostly stalled, said Ted Henken, a Cuba specialist at Baruch College in New York.

The government, he said, is ""very cautious because they know that economic freedom can lead to political freedom and loss of political control.""

Authorities have also failed to overhaul bloated state-run companies and government agencies that most of the population rely on for income.

""Laying off a lot of people could lead to social and political problems,"" William LeoGrande, an American University expert on Cuba, told The Associated Press.

LeoGrande also points to growing inequality in a system that promised Cubans precisely the opposite.

""Back in 1990s, there was a sense that we're all in this together,"" he said. ""Today, the inequality is not only worse, but it's also more manifest.""

The island's economy contracted 11% last year, even as Díaz-Canel broadened private enterprise, allowing Cubans to run almost any small business from their homes for the first time.

The economic disarray is spurring political discontent, with historic protests in Cuba, fueled in large part by the access to information from the outside world via the Internet. The emergence of a new artist revolt, started by Afro-Cuban rappers before widening to mainstream artists, is particularly astonishing.

Despite the unease, there are no signs that the end of the Castro era brings Cuba any closer to the end of communist rule, said Arturo Lopez-Levy, a Cuba expert at Holy Names University in California.

LOS ANGELES (AP)—Citing revenge for what they bill a consistently deteriorating support base and general lack of appreciation, area police are gearing up to get even with the community this evening. Their plan, known as “Operation Psycho Pig Rampage,” calls for the pillaging of homes, harassment of passersby and random shooting of harmless motorists.

Police officers will don riot gear and assault city residents at random, drowning the city in blood.

Officers cited both the O.J. Simpson and Rodney King trials as two incidents that have enormously undermined America’s faith in the police. According to police department insiders across the nation, African-Americans have direct reason to hate the police. In addition, many whites are filled with a once-removed, transitive sense of guilt/em-pathy for the abused black populace.

“The black community has nothing short of a gnawing hatred and mistrust of law enforcement officials,” Deputy police chief Gary Chower said. “And well they should. But that doesn’t mean we are not going to whup major ass this evening, when we roll through the community with the soul-crushing force of a Third World totalitarian autocracy.”

Police department insiders went on to cite years of verbal abuse by citizenry, public portrayals of police as villainous cogs of the system, and repeated lampooning in trucker-themed feature films as further reason for their rage.

“Operation Psycho Pig Rampage will undoubtedly be the average white middle-class liberal’s nightmare,” Officer Harrison Timkin said. “Not only will we subdue citizens with gas and billy clubs, but we hope to terrorize them psychologically as well, using menacing pig-faced tear gas masks to strike fear into their hearts.”

By Saturday the police hope to have needlessly maced, beaten and abused vast sections of the general populace and to have illegally jailed and detained hundreds more.

Psycho Pig organizers plan to use enormous loudspeaker amplification on city street corners to generate oinking and snorting sound effects as they beat citizens into hobbled submission.

Officers are convinced this is both fitting retribution and a necessary step for the populace to understand law enforcement officials’ new role in the American community.

One young police officer, rookie cop Roy Beamer, is looking forward to Psycho Pig Rampage with some reservation.

“I just joined the force and I’m not sure this whole rampage is right,” Beamer said. “But the captain and all the other guys want me to do it, so I guess I’m in support of it.”

Beamer plans to use his riot stick to beat old women until they involuntarily relieve their bowels.

Those in the community have not been supportive of Operation Psycho Pig Rampage, suggesting that it may be in violation of the inherent trust that many citizens have for their public servants.

“I fear for my life and my children’s lives,” area resident Madge Kimterfon said. “Please help us.”

Said resident Maureen Hemterfagh: “My God, they’re going to kill us all.”

Law enforcement officials fear neither reprisals, nor punishment for their actions.

“We are the only members of the community trained and sanctioned by the people to use violence, even deadly force, at our discretion,” Chower said. “Truly, the streets will run red with the blood of the innocent.”

0,An end to cigarettes? New Zealand aims to create smoke-free generation,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/16/new-zealand-aims-to-create-smoke-free-generation-cigarettes,"New Zealand has announced a suite of proposals aimed at outlawing smoking for the next generation and moving the country closer to its goal of being smoke-free by 2025.

The plans include the gradual increase of the legal smoking age, which could extend to a ban on the sale of cigarettes and tobacco products to anyone born after 2004, making smoking effectively illegal for that generation.

Also under consideration was a significant reduction in the level of nicotine allowed in tobacco products, prohibiting filters, setting a minimum price for tobacco, and restricting the locations where tobacco and cigarettes can be sold.

“We need a new approach,” Associate Health Minister Dr Ayesha Verrall said on Thursday, announcing the changes. “About 4,500 New Zealanders die every year from tobacco, and we need to make accelerated progress to be able to reach that goal [of Smokefree 2025]. Business-as-usual without a tobacco control program won’t get us there.”

The proposals were welcomed by a number of public health organisations. “This proposal goes beyond assisting people to quit,” Cancer Society chief executive Lucy Elwood said in a statement. She noted that the number of tobacco retailers was four times higher in low-income communities, where smoking rates were highest.

“These glaring inequities are why we need to protect future generations from the harms of tobacco,” Elwood said. “Tobacco is the most harmful consumer product in history and needs to be phased out.”

Shane Kawenata Bradbrook, a long- term advocate for smoke-free Māori communities, said in a statement that the plan “will begin the final demise of tobacco products in this country”. Smoking rates are highest among Māori and Pasifika New Zealanders, and he said it was vital those communities had a voice in the process.

“For too long the tobacco industry has been addicting our people, fleecing them of their money before we have to bury them in urupa [burial grounds] all over this land. I am looking forward to truly making this a sunset industry in this corner of the world.”

El-Shadan Tautolo, a professor of public health at Auckland University of Technology, also called the plan “a turning point”. If it included enough resources and the right people, “we will be able to reach our communities who have been underserved and under-resourced for long enough,” he said.

But the plans also faced criticism for potential unintended consequences, including the prospect of bankruptcy for small ‘dairy’ store owners, and the possibility of an expanded black market for tobacco. The government acknowledged this was a risk in its document outlining proposals: “Evidence indicates that the amount of tobacco products being smuggled into New Zealand has increased substantially in recent years and organised criminal groups are involved in large-scale smuggling,” it said.

Right-wing political party ACT said lowering nicotine content could result in smokers buying and smoking more to get their hit. “New Zealand smokers who can least afford it will spend more on their habit and in turn do harm to those around them if the government mandates lower nicotine,” the ACT social development and children spokesperson, Karen Chhour, said in a press release.

The move also sparked questions about the extent to which the government should intervene in people’s lives: “There’s a philosophical principle about adults being able to make decisions for themselves, within reason,” journalist Alex Braae wrote in an analysis for the Spinoff.

Smoking accounts for one in four cancer deaths in New Zealand, and around half a million New Zealanders smoke daily. The effects of that are most-felt among Māori, New Zealand’s indigenous people: Māori women have the country’s highest smoking rates, with about 30% smoking daily. Cancer is the leading cause of death for Māori women and the second leading cause for Māori men.",623,3902,11,70

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden and Japan Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga showcased the alliance between their two countries as well as their shared resolve in dealing with China as they met at the White House on Friday in Biden’s first face-to-face talks with a foreign leader as president.

Suga and Biden, who wore masks for their meeting in a visit modified by precautions against the coronavirus, were seeking to challenge messaging from Chinese President Xi Jinping that America and democracies in general are on the decline following the political turmoil and international withdrawal that marked Donald Trump’s presidency.

At a press conference in the Rose Garden after their meeting, Biden stressed U.S. commitments to Japan’s defense and said the alliance — the U.S. is Japan’s only treaty ally — would “prove that democracies can still commit and win” and “deliver for our people.”

Managing the alliance with the United States is one of the trickiest tasks for any leader of Japan, whose economy depends heavily on China and whose security depends on the U.S. Friday’s talks featured unusually frank talk from a Japanese leader against any effort by China to dominate the Indo-Pacific region by “force or coercion.”

Suga also called for peace and stability in Taiwan, and urged China — whose disputed claim to Taiwan is a potential flashpoint in the region and with the United States — to peacefully resolve the dispute. China under Xi has been increasingly deploying its military to assert its sweeping territorial claims, helping prod the United States, Japan and some other Indo-Pacific nations to strengthen their alliance.

Mildly worded as that part of the two leaders’ statement was, it marked the first time a Japanese prime minister had spoken out in a communique with the United States on Taiwan since 1969 talks between Richard Nixon and Eisaku Sato.

Suga told Japanese reporters after his White House visit that the two leaders and their aides had spent much of their meetings, conducted around a table in the White House state dining room, sharing stories of their lives and careers. It left them so engrossed “we ended up not even touching our hamburger steak prepared for us,” Suga said.

“I think we were able to establish a good relationship of trust,” he added.

The Biden administration calls managing U.S. policies toward China and the Indo-Pacific the primary challenge for the United States. That helped guide Biden’s decision, announced this week, to pull U.S. troops out of Afghanistan and free the administration to focus more on East Asia.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi had warned his Japanese counterpart in a call ahead of Suga’s visit to see to it that China-Japan relations “do not get involved in the so-called confrontation between major countries.”

Suga, a farmer’s son who rose to Japan’s highest political office after an early stint as a worker in a cardboard factory, succeeded Shinzo Abe as prime minister last September after long serving as his chief Cabinet secretary.

Suga expressed eagerness to meet with Biden early on despite global COVID-19 lockdowns.

The pandemic changed the normal routine for a visit by a foreign leader, so Biden didn’t host Suga for any formal meal. Earlier Friday, Suga placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery and visited with Vice President Kamala Harris. An honor guard greeted his arrival at the White House.

Speaking to reporters with Biden after their meetings, Suga also spoke out against a surge in attacks on Asians in the United States amid the coronavirus pandemic, and he and Biden pledged to fight such crimes.

Biden turned to Suga at one point in their press conference to note the recent victory of Japanese golfer Hideki Matsuyama in the Masters Tournament. The 29-year-old is the first Japanese player to win at Augusta National.

“You’ve got a Japanese boy coming over here, and guess what? He won the Masters,” Biden said.

Their joint statement also expressed concern over human rights for residents of Hong Kong and for China’s ethnic Muslim minority, marking another step where Japan was acceding to a U.S. push for a public rebuke to China. Both countries, however, declared they planned to work with China “on areas of common interest.”

Japan long has moved cautiously on steps that might worsen relations with China, though Suga has been more outspoken. His administration pushed its comfort zone in a statement stressing “peace and stability” on the Taiwan Strait. That came during a visit last month by Secretary of State Tony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, which was the Biden administration’s highest-level face-to-face meeting at the time.

China tested U.S. and Taiwanese resolve weeks into the Biden administration by sending fighter jets and bombers near Taiwan.

Japan considers China’s growing military activity and broad territorial claims to be security threats. Japan is itself locked in a dispute with China over Beijing’s claim to the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands, called Diaoyu in China, in the East China Sea.

Elsewhere, Tokyo has watched with concern as China has built military installations on disputed territory it claims in the South China Sea.

U.S. ships regularly conduct so-called freedom of navigation operations, sailing into international waters that China claims as its own.

Biden as president has taken a different approach to China’s growing assertiveness and other global challenges, reaching out to allies as a first step.

President Barack Obama was seen as cajoling China, in hopes of encouraging reforms. After initially praising Xi, Trump later took on China head-on and solo, with tariffs and insults, while building a golf-buddy relationship with Suga’s predecessor, Abe.

The Biden-Suga meeting also saw new announcements on a series of alliance-building moves.

The U.S. and Japanese governments have been working to strengthen technology supply chains independent of China during a shortage of semiconductors that’s worrying businesses around the world. And both countries are expected in coming days to make deeper commitments to cutting climate-wrecking fossil fuel emissions, in line with Biden’s climate summit with 40 world leaders next week.

0,Founder of Adobe and Developer of PDFs Dies at Age 81,https://english.aawsat.com/home/article/2925771/founder-adobe-and-developer-pdfs-dies-age-81,"Asharq Al-Awsat

Charles “Chuck” Geschke — the co-founder of the major software company Adobe Inc. who helped develop Portable Document Format technology, or PDFs — died at age 81.

Geschke, who lived in the San Francisco Bay Area suburb of Los Altos, died Friday, the company said.

“This is a huge loss for the entire Adobe community and the technology industry, for whom he has been a guide and hero for decades,” Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen wrote in an email to the company's employees.

“As co-founders of Adobe, Chuck and John Warnock developed groundbreaking software that has revolutionized how people create and communicate,"" Narayen said. ""Their first product was Adobe PostScript, an innovative technology that provided a radical new way to print text and images on paper and sparked the desktop publishing revolution. Chuck instilled a relentless drive for innovation in the company, resulting in some of the most transformative software inventions, including the ubiquitous PDF, Acrobat, Illustrator, Premiere Pro and Photoshop.”

His wife said Geschke was also proud of his family.

“He was a famous businessman, the founder of a major company in the U.S. and the world, and of course he was very, very proud of that and it was huge achievement in his life, but it wasn’t his focus — really, his family was,” Nancy “Nan” Geschke, 78, told the Mercury News on Saturday. “He always called himself the luckiest man in the world.”

After earning a doctorate from Carnegie Mellon University, Geschke began working at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, where he met Warnock, the Mercury News reported. The men left the company in 1982 to found Adobe, developing software together.

In 2009, President Barack Obama awarded Geschke and Warnock the National Medal of Technology.

In 1992, Geschke survived a kidnapping, the Mercury News reported.

Arriving to work one morning, two men seized Geschke, then 52, at gunpoint and took him to Hollister, California, where he was held for four days. A suspect caught with $650,000 in ransom money eventually led police to the hideout where he was held captive, The Associated Press reported.",348,2138,11,53

0,‘Frightening’: Weekend shutdown in Delhi as COVID grips India,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/17/frightening-weekend-shutdown-in-delhi-as-covid-grips-india,"India faces a ferocious new coronavirus wave with more than 234,000 new cases on Saturday – the eighth record high increase in nine days.

New Delhi went into a weekend lockdown on Saturday as India faces a ferocious new coronavirus wave, with daily cases hitting another record increase of 234,692 nationwide and families clamouring for drugs and hospital beds.

The health ministry said the latest number is the eighth record high in the last nine days.

Total cases have gone past 14.5 million, second only to the United States which has reported more than 32 million infections.

India’s deaths from COVID-19 rose by 1,341 to reach a total of 175,649, the data showed.

Hopes that South Asian countries might have beaten the pandemic have been dashed with India seeing more than two million new cases this month alone and Bangladesh and Pakistan imposing shutdowns.

India’s per-capita rates remain low by international comparison, raising the prospect that infection numbers – fuelled possibly by a virulent new “double mutant” – may explode further.

After a national lockdown a year ago led to hundreds of deaths and one of the worst slumps of any major economy, the Indian government is desperate to avoid a second stoppage.

Many states are, however, clamping down, including hotspot Maharashtra, industry-heavy Gujarat and IT hub Bangalore’s home state Karnataka, although restrictions are less onerous than last year.

Uttar Pradesh state, home to some 240 million people, on Friday announced that all villages and cities would be under lockdown for one day on Sunday.

In the capital, New Delhi, which has overtaken Mumbai as the worst-hit Indian city, restaurants, malls, gyms and spas were closed for the weekend.

Weddings though are permitted with guests limited to 50, while a maximum of 20 people can attend funerals. Movie theatres can open with one-third capacity.

“Don’t panic. All essential services will be available through the weekend,” the city of 25 million people’s chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said.

Holy dip

Similarly, the northern state of Uttarakhand has restricted gatherings to 200 people – but exempted the vast ongoing Hindu festival Kumbh Mela.

The gathering in Haridwar has attracted as many as 25 million people since January, including some 4.6 million this week alone, with most people ignoring COVID-19 guidelines.

One seer on Thursday died from the virus and 80 other holy men have tested positive, and experts fear that the millions of devotees will now take the virus back to their home towns and villages.

Election rallies are also going ahead in the eastern state of West Bengal, with Home Minister Amit Shah attending two roadshows and one public meeting on Friday alone.

In state capital Kolkata, railway employee Samaresh Tapna fell sick after attending one such gathering and was hospitalised.

“I felt angry with myself … I cursed my fate,” the 42-year-old told AFP.

Running short of oxygen

Hospitals are running short of oxygen and coronavirus medicines, such as remdesivir, prompting desperate people to pay exorbitant rates on the black market.

Social media is full of horror stories of desperate calls to help a loved one needing hospital treatment for COVID-19 or other complaints.

“I lost a cousin on Saturday. He was not admitted after a stroke. Tried 4 hospitals,” read one message on a Delhi neighbourhood WhatsApp group this week.

“Last year, there were practically no children presenting symptoms,” said Khusrav Bajan, a consultant at Mumbai’s PD Hinduja National Hospital.

India’s drive to vaccinate its 1.3 billion people has also hit obstacles, with just 117 million shots administered so far and stocks running low, according to some local authorities.

“[It is] understandable that many people are sick of the restrictions and want to resume normal life. We must redouble our efforts to contain this disease as too many lives are at stake,” said Udaya Regmi from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).

“This is a wake-up call to the world. Vaccines must be available to everyone, everywhere, rich and poor to overcome this terrible pandemic,” Regmi said in a statement, calling the surge across South Asia “truly frightening”.",774,4815,9,61

The Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF) has been gathering photos and videos of such incidents as part of a comprehensive report to the US Congress due this June, as per Mystery Wire on April 8.

Some of these materials were obtained by investigative filmmaker Jeremy Corbell, who published these online on the same day via his website, extraordinarybeliefs.com.

Corbell, along with renowned investigative journalist George Knapp, verified the authenticity of these materials as well as the information provided by the task force.

One of the videos from July 2019, which was taken by Navy officers with a night vision device, shows a pyramid-shaped UFO hovering 700 feet above the USS Russell off San Diego, California.

Corbell also shared the footage and the photos of the said incident via Twitter and other social media accounts on April 9.

May 1st 2020 a classified briefing was generated about the UFO / UAP presence via the Office of Naval Intelligence.

While others claim that these flying objects are either drones or weather balloons, the UAPTF and the Navy have classified them as “unknowns” for now, the report said. An unidentified flying object is not necessarily an extraterrestial object.

Corbell noted on his website that the pyramid-shaped UFOs were first shown in a classified briefing on May 1, 2020, about UFO or UAP presence via the Office of Naval Intelligence.

“Those familiar with the briefing articulated to me that the goal was to de-stigmatize the UAP problem and to promote more intelligence collection regarding UAP incursions and encounters with active military deployments,” he shared.

Aside from the pyramid-shaped UFOs, Corbell also shared that part of the briefing focused on the incident between the USS Omaha and a spherical craft.

Corbell noted that the Navy suspects this craft to be a “trans-medium” vehicle, as it was observed by Navy personnel to descend into the ocean after flying.

The Pentagon also confirmed the authenticity of the materials Corbell published after Mystery Wire reached out for a comment.

“I can confirm that the referenced photos and videos were taken by Navy personnel. The UAPTF has included these incidents in their ongoing examinations,” Pentagon spokesperson Susan Gough was quoted as saying in a statement sent to Mystery Wire on April 9.

The US military, however, maintained that it will not disclose any more information regarding the phenomena.

“As we have said before, to maintain operations security and to avoid disclosing information that may be useful to potential adversaries, [Department of Defense] does not discuss publicly the details of either the observations or the examinations of reported incursions into our training ranges or designated airspace, including those incursions initially designated as UAP,” the Pentagon spokesperson said.

Islamabad (AFP)

Western governments should treat people who insult the Prophet Mohammed the same as those who deny the Holocaust, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said Saturday.

Speaking after a week of violent protests in Pakistan by a radical Islamist party outraged by French government support for magazines publishing cartoons of Mohammed, Khan said insulting the prophet hurt Muslims around the world.

""We Muslims have the greatest love & respect for our Prophet,"" he tweeted.

""We cannot tolerate any such disrespect & abuse.""

The group Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) was banned Thursday after days of violent protests during which four policemen were killed.

The radical party has orchestrated a months-long campaign for the expulsion of the French ambassador to protest against President Emmanuel Macron's defence of the cartoons' publication.

The French embassy in Islamabad on Thursday recommended its nationals leave Pakistan, a call that appears to have gone largely unheeded.

""I... call on Western govts who have outlawed any negative comment on the holocaust to use the same standards to penalise those deliberately spreading their message of hate against Muslims by abusing our Prophet,"" Khan tweeted.

Denying the Holocaust is illegal in several European countries -- including Germany and France -- and offenders can be jailed.

Khan suggested the government had not banned the TLP because it disagreed with TLP's motivation, but rather its methods.

""Let me make clear to people here & abroad: Our govt only took action against TLP under our anti-terrorist law when they challenged the writ of the state and used street violence & attacking the public & law enforcers,"" he said.

""No one can be above the law and the Constitution.""

1,Brutal: Playstation Has Cancelled The Entire PS5 Game Lineup After @NicoBoy95 Commented ‘No One Cares’ On Their Livestream,https://ogn.theonion.com/brutal-playstation-has-cancelled-the-entire-ps5-game-l-1844017062,"Well, Playstation fans, it looks like we’re all facing a harsh new reality. After yesterday’s ultra-hyped Playstation 5 press event, Sony reviewed player feedback and just announced they will be canceling their entire lineup of next-generation games in response to @NicoBoy95’s devastating comment that “No one cares” on their livestream.

Oof. Looks like it’s back to the drawing board for every single game on the gaming giant’s upcoming console.



“We saw NicoBoy95’s harsh, but ultimately correct, takedown of our presentation and decided the only wise course of action was to scrap everything we were planning and start from scratch,” said Sony Interactive president Jim Ryan, who told OGN that even third-party games like NBA 2K21 have been permanently shelved until the company can figure out a way forward that is acceptable to NicoBoy95. “Seeing this comment appear in the chat box on YouTube during the stream was a real wake-up call. To hear that nobody cares about these games is heartbreaking, especially after how hard we worked on them.”



“But it’s feedback we need to act on, not ignore,” he added.

This may be tough news for people who were actually pumped to play Horizon: Forbidden West, Deathloop, or the new Ratchet & Clank, but gamers do not say things like “No one cares” unless they believe deeply that these are the truths game makers desperately need to know.



“Frankly, I was up all night just thinking about what we could have done wrong to garner this sort of reaction,” Ryan continued, noting that it was a tough pill to swallow knowing that millions of hours of work from thousands of artists, programmers, and engineers would have to be thrown away. “Still, as painful as it’s been for us to delete hundreds of teraflops of games from our servers—games that we thought were pretty good—it’s up to us to satisfy all of our fans. And so I thank NicoBoy95 for his honesty.”



“Hopefully we can rectify this dismal failure and have a stronger lineup for release by 2025,” he continued.

Sounds tough but fair to us, gamers. We here at OGN applaud Playstation’s willingness to look in the mirror and be honest when they have failed. If only Microsoft would follow their lead and cancel the Xbox Series One entirely.

Ms Clinton on Wednesday retweeted a post showing that Carlson’s anti-vaccine monologue had become the most popular post on Facebook, according to data from the tool CrowdTangle .

“In December, @facebook banned claims about #covid19 vaccines ‘that have been debunked by public health experts. And yet…” Ms Clinton wrote .

“Especially troubling given Republican men are currently most likely to say they’re not interested in being vaccinated,” she added.

On his Tuesday night show, Carlson speculated that if vaccinated people are still required to wear masks and practise social distancing, the vaccine must not work.

“If vaccines work, why are vaccinated people still banned from living normal lives?” the host complained. “So maybe it doesn’t work, and they’re simply not telling you that. Well, you hate to think that, especially if you’ve gotten two shots, but what’s the other potential explanation? We can’t think of one.”

Carlson has already faced intense criticism for his remarks, which public health experts say undermine confidence in the vaccines.

“That’s just a typical crazy conspiracy theory,” Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, told CNN . “It’s certainly not helpful to the public health of this nation or even globally.”

The three vaccines that have been approved for use in the United States are in fact overwhelmingly effective. In clinical trials, the Pfizer-BioNTech shot was found to be 95 per cent effective at preventing Covid-19, while that number was 94.1 per cent for Moderna and 72 per cent for Johnson & Johnson (but 86 per cent for preventing severe disease), according to Yale Medicine .

“Look at the data,” Dr Fauci said in response to Carlson’s comments. “The data are overwhelming in the three vaccines that have been approved for use in an emergency use authorisation: The J&J, the Pfizer, and the Moderna – you had 30,000, 44,000, and 40,000 people in the clinical trial with an overwhelming signal of efficacy. So I don’t have any idea what he’s talking about.”

Nevertheless, Carlson’s diatribe has proven extremely popular online. At the moment Ms Clinton posted her tweet, a Facebook post featuring his comments had clocked almost 600,000 views.

The Clinton Foundation , at which Chelsea Clinton is a vice chair, has worked actively to dispel misinformation about Covid-19 vaccines. Earlier this month, the Foundation released a booklet to help community and religious leaders educate their constituents about the shots. Vice Chair Clinton wrote the introduction.

“Some Americans still have questions and doubts about the COVID-19 vaccines, and are in search of guidance,” she wrote . “The Clinton Foundation has put together this toolkit to help facilitate conversations with members of your community, give people the facts around COVID-19 vaccines, and dispel any myths that might be discouraging them from getting their shot.”

1,Report: China To Overtake U.S. As World's Biggest Asshole By 2020,https://www.theonion.com/report-china-to-overtake-u-s-as-worlds-biggest-asshol-1819571423,"Chinese president and rising international dipshit Hu Jintao.

WASHINGTON—According to a new report released Monday by a panel of top economists and social scientists, the People's Republic of China will overtake the United States as the world's dominant asshole by the year 2020.

Advertisement

The findings, published in the most recent issue of Foreign Affairs, support recent speculation that America's unquestioned reign as the leading super-prick may soon be drawing to a close, leaving China as the foremost shithead among all developed nations.

""We are seeing a changing of the asshole guard,"" said Andrew Freireich, noted economist and lead author of the article. ""Although the U.S. will remain among the world's two or three biggest cocks through much of this century, we can now confidently project that China, with its soaring economic growth, ever-expanding cultural influence, and total disregard for basic human rights, will overtake America as King Prick Numero Uno within the next 10 years.""

Added Freireich, ""It's the dawning of a new huge bastard era.""

According to the report, China has slowly emerged as a massive fucker over the past half century, a period of egotistical growth unseen since America's booming douche years following World War II.

According to estimates, China already has a slight lead on the U.S. in not giving a fuck about climate change.

Over that same time, China has seen a dramatic rise in both its GDP and Shithead Index, definite signs that the Asian nation is developing into a cocksucker of global proportions.

""When you consider China's wanton pollution, rising militarism, and rampant overdevelopment, it's clear they'll soon be thoroughly out-dicking the U.S. in every measurable area,"" international affairs specialist Neil Farren said. ""Not many Americans want to admit it, but as the yuan continues to get stronger, and millions upon millions are exploited as a result, more and more people worldwide will be looking to China, not America, and saying, 'Man, can you believe what an unbelievable sack of shit that country is?'""

China's ascension to supreme asshole status is occurring at a much faster pace than experts originally predicted. In fact, many now believe that by as early as 2015 Chinese citizens will arrogantly strut across the globe disrespecting other cultures and shouting loudly while dressed in XXL ""Speak Chinese or Go Home"" T-shirts.

Prominent scholars claim that America's gradual fall from the upper echelon of international supershits is merely part of an inevitable pattern seen time and again throughout world history.

""All of the great asshole nations eventually watch their day in the sun slip away,"" historian Richard Merriam told reporters. ""Don't forget that Great Britain was the world's dominant asshole for well over three centuries, and look at it now: a pussy-whipped shell of the insufferable, bullying jackass it used to be.""

Advertisement

Others have posited that China's ascension may be part of a larger reorganization of the global asshole hegemony that could see the United States losing even more ground in the century to come.

""A country like Iran is obviously a pretty big dick, but ultimately it lacks the resources to be a truly world-class asshole,"" Farran said. ""Same goes for Pakistan. But the list of abominable shit-heel countries competing for global prick dominance is a long one, and the U.S. is just going to have to get used to seeing countries like Russia and India mentioned in the same breath as itself.""

""Many Americans are going to be upset over the prospect of falling from that top spot, but that's the reality we face,"" Farrar continued. ""Hopefully, the United States will find a way to grow and adjust to its evolving role on the world stage without acting like a complete and utter fuckhead about it.""",623,3883,11,65

Berlin (AFP)

German prosecutors said Friday they are investigating a Russian man suspected of helping to plan the murder of a Chechen dissident living in Germany on orders of the Chechen regime.

The probe comes at a time of increasing tensions between Germany and Russia over Ukraine, the poisoning and imprisonment of opposition leader Alexei Navalny and the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline.

French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were also holding talks Friday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a show of support for his pro-Western government after a Russian military build-up on its eastern borders raised fears of an invasion.

German prosecutors named the suspect as Valid D., accusing him of ""making a declaration of readiness to commit murder, preparing a serious act of violence endangering the state and violating the weapons act"".

He was arrested in January and is in pre-trial detention.

According to German media reports, the target was Mokhmad Abdurakhmanov, the brother of exiled Chechen blogger Tumso Abdurakhmanov, who lives in Sweden.

In February 2020, Tumso Abdurakhmanov was struck in the head with a hammer while he was sleeping in his apartment in the Swedish city of Gavle.

A Swedish court in January convicted a Russian citizen of attempted murder.

After the attack, Tumso Abdurakhmanov posted a video showing the assailant, whom he had apparently overpowered, covered in blood. He also brandished the hammer that he said the assailant used to attack him.

Tumso Abdurakhmanov's YouTube channel is critical of Chechen strongman leader Ramzan Kadyrov and has around 318,000 subscribers.

- Shooting exercises -

According to Der Spiegel news magazine, the attack on Mokhmad Abdurakhmanov was planned in Bavaria in December.

In the run-up to the killing, those involved had carried out shooting exercises in the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, it said.

Valid D. is alleged to have been instructed to bring the murder weapon and the contract killer to Germany, spy on the intended victim and act as a driver during the assassination.

He had managed to smuggle the intended hitman into Germany and obtain a firearm with a silencer, prosecutors said.

According to Der Spiegel, a second suspect in the investigation has testified that the Chechen government offered him 500,000 euros to commit a murder in Germany.

The man claims to have accepted the offer only as a pretence and investigators believe him, it reported.

- Sharpened tone -

Merkel has always stressed the importance of keeping dialogue open with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but she has sharpened her tone in recent months.

The West has accused the Russian government of poisoning Navalny with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok last August, which the Kremlin denies.

Navalny was treated in Berlin before he returned to Moscow in January, where he was imprisoned in a penal colony. His supporters have since become increasingly concerned for his health.

Russia has for years drawn the ire of Western powers, from annexing Ukraine's Crimea to meddling in elections and backing President Bashar al-Assad's government in Syria.

Merkel last year also revealed that she was the target of ""outrageous"" hacking attempts by Russia.

Another Russian man went on trial in Germany in October over the murder of a former commander in Chechnya in a Berlin park, allegedly on Moscow's orders.

The 55-year-old named by prosecutors as Vadim Krasikov, alias Vadim Sokolov, stands accused of gunning down Georgian national 40-year-old Tornike Kavtarashvili, in Kleiner Tiergarten park on August 23, 2019.

A former Chechen separatist turned ardent Kremlin loyalist, Kadyrov, 44, is one of Russia's most powerful men.

Сritics accuse him of creating a fiefdom built on widespread rights abuses and amassing vast personal wealth.

Calling himself President Vladimir Putin's loyal ""foot soldier"", Kadyrov has branded members of the Russian opposition ""jackals"" and ""enemies of the people"".

0,U.S. Has Only ‘Low To Medium’ Confidence That Russians Put Bounties On American Troops,https://www.tampafp.com/u-s-has-only-low-to-medium-confidence-that-russians-put-bounties-on-american-troops/,"Chuck Ross

The Biden administration has only “low to medium” confidence that Russia put bounties on American troops in Afghanistan, U.S. officials said Thursday.

“The United States intelligence community assesses with low to moderate confidence that Russian intelligence officers sought to encourage Taliban attacks U.S. and coalition personnel in Afghanistan in 2019 and perhaps earlier,” a U.S. official told reporters Thursday.

According to reporters who attended a briefing about the intelligence, officials attach a low confidence level to the allegation because it came from “detainee reporting,” meaning that a captured Taliban fighter likely provided the information.

Officials said that sources for the assessment are “information and evidence of connections to criminal agents in Afghanistan and elements of the Russian government.”

Democrats last year seized on news reports about alleged bounty payments to Taliban fighters to accuse President Donald Trump of being too soft on the Kremlin.

The New York Times reported last June that U.S. officials believed that Russian intelligence was paying Taliban fighters to target U.S. military personnel. The Times also initially reported that Trump was briefed on the situation, but did nothing in response to the Russian aggression.

Subsequent reports showed that U.S. officials were divided on whether Russia paid the bounties. The Times also softened its language about the level of confidence that officials had regarding payments. Trump himself questioned the accuracy of the report, while insisting that he had not been briefed about bounties.

Despite questions about the reporting, Democrats, including now-President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, blasted Trump for not retaliating against Russia, either through sanctions or other measures.

0,UN Urges Bangladesh to Move Rohingya to Bay of Bengal Island Gradually,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/move-04162021161013.html,"Rohingya walk by houses built for them by the Bangladesh government on Bhashan Char Island in Noakhali district, March 13, 2021.

The United Nations refugee agency is urging Bangladesh to slow down its relocation of Rohingya to a low-lying island because measures to protect residents from storms and flooding are not fully in place, UNHCR in Dhaka told BenarNews on Friday.

Meanwhile, the foreign minister said, international agencies must help foot the cost of housing what could eventually be 100,000 refugees on Bhashan Char, an island in the Bay of Bengal. So far, Bangladesh’s government has covered that cost.

A UNHCR team visited the island March 17-20 and recognized that the government had made “extensive investments” in setting up infrastructure and safeguards on the flood-prone island for the thousands of Rohingya who have moved there, said Charlie Goodlake, a spokesman for the U.N. agency in Dhaka.

“At the same time, the U.N. team believes it is critical that the ongoing extension of the embankment is completed as early as possible and to full specification which, when complete, would reduce the risk of storm surges and flooding on the island,” Goodlake told BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service, in a statement.

In addition, it was also essential to put in place an emergency management plan for severe weather events, including building up stocks of essential supplies and goods on the island, UNHCR said.

“The U.N. team recommends to the government that any future relocations are undertaken in a gradual and phased manner, which would help to ensure that the governance structure, facilities and services available on Bhashan Char are commensurate to the needs of Rohingya refugees living there,” Goodlake said.

Since December, the government has moved a total of 18,304 Rohingya from crowded camps in southeastern Cox’s Bazar district. The camps host around 1 million refugees who fled persecution in Rakhine state, next-door in Myanmar.

The government had said it spent about U.S. $280 million to construct housing, a large embankment to protect the island’s population from flooding, and other infrastructure in a bid to relieve pressure on the crowded mainland camps.

An official told BenarNews in December 2018 that the embankment would gradually be made 21 feet high, although he did not say how tall the embankment was at the time.

Last December, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had said Bhashan Char was secure from cyclones, as was demonstrated during the deadly Cyclone Amphan in May 2020.

“The flood and shore protection measures with the 12.1 km- [7.5 mile-] long and sufficiently higher embankment designed by [British firm] HR Wallingford secures the island from massive tidal waves and cyclones,” the ministry said in a statement.

“This is supplemented by the installation of modern hydrographic monitoring and warning system that can provide early warning on any natural hazards and enable prior evacuation.”

Funds for Rohingya on island

Bangladesh’s government wants international funds raised through the U.N. Joint Response Plan to be used for the Rohingya on Bhashan Char as well, Foreign Minister A.K. Abdul Momen said on Friday.

If funds are focused only on humanitarian efforts in Cox’s Bazar, the government will demand a share of the funds for facilities on the island, he said.

“If the humanitarian agencies do not support the Rohingya in Bhashan Char, we will demand 10 percent of those funds,” Momen told BenarNews, even as he acknowledged that he did not know how the UNHCR spends the funds it collects for the Rohingya and their host communities.

He said U.N. agencies were obligated to provide services for the Rohingya regardless of where the refugees live. And U.N. member-states, he said, would not provide funds if humanitarian agencies did not provide services to Rohingya in Bhashan Char as well.

In response, Goodlake, the UNHCR’s Dhaka spokesman, said that if the U.N. were to “operationally engage” in the island, “any related funding requirements for Bhashan Char would need to be agreed in close consultation with relevant stakeholders, notably with the donor community and the government.”

The U.N. team that visited the island last month said it “clearly” recognized the prevailing humanitarian and protection needs of the Rohingya refugees already relocated to Bhashan Char, he said.

“The U.N. has therefore proposed further discussions with the government regarding its future operational engagement on Bhashan Char, including on the policies that govern the life and wellbeing of Rohingya refugees on the island,” Goodlake said.

Momen’s comments about funding for Bhashan Char followed months-long criticism of Bangladesh’s plan to move Rohingya to the off-shore site.

International humanitarian organizations have expressed concern about the safety and on-site facilities on the island. Their fears were not mitigated by what was perceived as reluctance by Bangladesh to allow the U.N. to conduct a technical assessment of the island.

But many Rohingya who moved to Bhashan Char have told BenarNews that they were happy to have left the congested Cox’s Bazar camps. Living conditions on Bhashan Char were better, they said, and their children had wide open spaces where they could play.

And now that a U.N. team and three other international organizations have visited the island, many Bangladeshi analysts believe that any worries about the island’s habitability would be allayed.

The U.N. team which visited Bhashan Char found that many of the Rohingya were engaged in constructive activities and felt optimistic about their lives there, Goodlake acknowledged.

U.S. special envoy John Kerry, who visited Bangladesh last week, heaped praise on Bangladesh for its “extraordinary” generosity in sheltering the refugees from Myanmar, and mentioned Dhaka’s decision to relocate thousands of Rohingya to Bhashan Char.

“Bangladesh has been one of the greatest helping hands, you’ve given them an island,” Kerry, President Joe Biden’s special envoy for the climate, told reporters in Dhaka on April 9.

The United States opened more distance between itself and much of the rest of the world Thursday, nearing the 200 millionth vaccine administered in a race to protect the population against COVID-19, even as other countries, rich and poor, struggle with stubbornly high infection rates and deaths.

Nearly half of American adults have gotten at least one dose of the vaccine, and about 30% of adults in the U.S. have been fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the picture is still relentlessly grim in parts of Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia as variants of the virus fuel an increase in new cases and the worldwide death toll closes in on 3 million.

France on Thursday passed 100,000 virus deaths , becoming only the the eighth country to do so.

India’s two largest cities, New Delhi and Mumbai, imposed business shutdowns and stringent restrictions on movement as new infections shot past 200,000. Some hotels and banquet halls were ordered to convert their space into wards for treating virus patients, and the surge forced India — a major vaccine producer — to delay exports of doses to other countries.

Japan also saw a rapid resurgence of infections just three months before it’s scheduled to host the Olympics. The country’s western metropolis of Osaka reported over 1,200 new infections Thursday, its highest since the pandemic began. A top ruling party official suggested the possibility of canceling the games if the infections make them impossible.

Troubling signs also emerged in the U.S., despite the good news that more than 198 million coronavirus shots have been administered nationwide. The seven-day average of daily shots given hit 2.9 million last week.

New daily infections in the U.S. have increased 11% in the past two weeks. Many U.S. states have lifted mask mandates and restrictions on businesses and public gatherings. But more sick people are being admitted to hospitals in some states, including Michigan, which leads the nation with nearly 8,000 new infections per day.

In suburban Detroit, Dr. Nick Gilpin of Beaumont Health likened a rising crush of coronavirus patients to a “runaway train.” Staff were using tents to handle the flow of people seeking emergency care from Michigan’s largest hospital system, which on Thursday was treating more than 800 patients for COVID-19. That’s up from about 500 two weeks ago.

“Our COVID-19 numbers are climbing higher and faster, and it’s very troubling and alarming to see this,” said John Fox, chief executive of Beaumont Health, which operates eight hospitals.

Coronavirus patients statewide were near record numbers in Michigan, which had 3,960 people with confirmed infections hospitalized Wednesday.

Even though half of U.S. adults are still completely unvaccinated, dwindling demand for coronavirus shots was reported by some hospitals in Alabama and Missouri. Both states already lag the nation overall in vaccinating their populations.

In Alabama, only 37% of adults have received even one vaccine dose. Yet East Alabama Medical Center near Auburn University said it was preparing to wind down its vaccination program in a county where fewer than 18% are fully vaccinated.

“The number of vaccine requests has reached a plateau,” hospital spokesman John Atkinson said in a statement.

Cullman Regional Medical Center north of Birmingham also cited declining demand in a statement announcing that its vaccine clinic was being moved to an urgent care center. Hospital spokeswoman Lindsey Dossey later said the drop in demand was because of “more access to the vaccine” at other sites.

Health care officials in Missouri are also worried that not enough people are seeking shots. A large federally operated vaccination site in downtown St. Louis is administering less than half its capacity of 3,000 shots per day. Missouri health department spokeswoman Lisa Cox said the number of public health agencies requesting vaccine last week was down half compared to a week earlier.

“Some of them do feel like they have really hit a wall as far as who is interested,” Cox said, adding that the state plans to start a public awareness campaign soon.

In other developments, the U.S. government reported Thursday that some vaccinated people, as expected, have become sick from the coronavirus, though such cases are rare. The CDC said about 5,800 of the “breakthrough” infections have been confirmed. That’s out of about 75 million Americans who have been fully vaccinated, but the agency warned that reporting of such cases is uneven and incomplete.

Full Coverage: Coronavirus pandemic

Serious illness among vaccinated Americans is even more rare, with fewer than 400 who were hospitalized and 74 who died. As with the flu, people who get COVID-19 after being vaccinated are more likely to have a milder illness than unvaccinated people, the CDC has said.

More than a third of the world’s deaths have occurred in three countries — the United States, Mexico and Brazil, where a total of more than 1.1 million have perished. The virus is claiming about 12,000 lives each day.

The recent decision to suspend the use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine due to preliminary reports of rare blood clots left South Africa without any shots in its battle against an aggressive coronavirus variant. South Africa has more than 1.5 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, including at least 53,000 deaths, representing more than 30% of all the confirmed cases in Africa’s 54 countries.

Meanwhile, Germany’s health ministry announced that the country administered a national record of more than 738,000 vaccine shots Wednesday, though authorities also warned that hospitals were seeing a dramatic rise in coronavirus patients.

Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai will serve 12 months in prison for taking part in an unauthorised assembly during the 2019 mass pro-democracy protests in the Chinese-ruled financial hub.

Hong Kong's District Court Judge Amanda Woodcock gave Lai a 15-month sentence, reduced by three months in mitigation.

Martin Lee, who helped launch the city’s largest opposition Democratic Party in the 1990s and is often called the former British colony’s “father of democracy,” was given a suspended sentence of 11 months in the same case.

0,Russia: FSB detains Ukrainian diplomat over classified information | DW | 17.04.2021,https://dw.com/p/3s9d3?maca=en-gk-volltext-newsstand-topstories-en-10709-xml-googlenews,"Russia has detained a Ukrainian diplomat for allegedly receiving classified information from a database of the country's main security agency.

The move comes amid heightened tensions between the two foes amid a Russian troop build-up close to the Ukrainian border.

The Federal Security Service, or FSB, said in a statement Saturday that Alexander Sosonyuk, Ukraine's consul in St. Petersburg, was taken into custody a day earlier.

The intelligence agency added that Sosonyuk was caught ""red-handed"" during a meeting with a Russian in which he received ""information of a classified nature contained in the databases of law enforcement agencies and the FSB.""

""Such activity is not compatible with his diplomatic status and is of clearly hostile nature towards the Russian Federation.""

The statement, reported by Russian news agencies, didn't give further details.

Ukraine's foreign ministry said Sosonyuk was held for several hours, but was now back at the country's consulate in St. Petersburg.

Russia has detained a number of Ukrainian nationals on suspicion of spying in recent years but the detention of a diplomat is rare.

Neighbors move closer to the edge

The detention comes amid escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine amid a Russian military buildup along the border with the eastern Ukraine region, which is under the control of Russia-backed

rebels.

Kiev has been battling the separatists since 2014, and clashes have intensified since the start of the year, shredding a ceasefire that was agreed last July.

Concern has been mounting that the long-simmering conflict could spiral back into wider fighting, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has asked the West for help.

0,Raul Castro resigns as head of Cuba's Communist Party,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/raul-castro-resigns-head-cuba-communist-party/,"Raul Castro said Friday he is resigning as head of Cuba's Communist Party, ending an era of leadership that began with his brother Fidel and the country's 1959 revolution. The 89-year-old Castro made the announcement in a speech at the opening of the eighth Congress of the ruling party, the only one allowed on the island.

He said he was retiring with the sense of having ""fulfilled his mission and confident in the future of the fatherland.""

""Nothing, nothing, nothing is forcing me to make this decision,"" Castro said in his speech to the closed Congress, part of which was aired on state television. ""As long as I live I will be ready with my foot in the stirrup to defend the homeland, the revolution and socialism with more force than ever.""

Castro didn't say who he would endorse as his successor as first secretary of the Communist Party. But he previously indicated he favors yielding control to 60-year-old Miguel Díaz-Canel, who succeeded him as president in 2018 and is the standard bearer of a younger generation of loyalists who have been pushing an economic opening without touching Cuba's one-party system.

Photographs released by the official Cuban News Agency showed Castro, dressed in an olive green uniform, entering the compound with Díaz-Canel by his side.

Castro's retirement means that for the first time in more than six decades, Cubans won't have a Castro formally guiding their affairs. Many had been expecting the change.

""One has to step aside for the young people,"" said 64-year-old retiree Juana Busutil, for whom Castro ""is going to continue being the leader.""

The transition comes at a difficult time for Cuba, with many on the island anxious about what lies ahead.

The coronavirus pandemic, painful financial reforms and restrictions imposed by the Trump administration have battered the economy, which shrank 11% last year as a result of a collapse in tourism and remittances. Long food lines and shortages have brought back echoes of the ""special period"" that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s.

Discontent has been fueled by the spread of the internet and growing inequality. Much of the debate inside Cuba is focused on the pace of reform, with many complaining that the so-called ""historic generation"" represented by Castro has been too slow to open the economy.

In January, Díaz-Canel finally pulled the trigger on a plan approved two congresses ago to unify the island's dual currency system, giving rise to fears of inflation. He also threw the doors open to a broader range of private enterprise — a category long banned or tightly restricted — permitting Cubans to legally operate many sorts of self-run businesses from their homes.

This year's Congress is expected to focus on unfinished reforms to overhaul state-run enterprises, attracting foreign investment and providing more legal protection to private business activities.

The Communist Party is made up of 700,000 activists and is tasked in Cuba's constitution with directing the affairs of the nation and society.

Fidel Castro, who led the revolution that drove dictator Fulgencio Batista from power in 1959, formally became head of the party in 1965, about four years after officially embracing socialism.

He quickly absorbed the old party under his control and was the country's unquestioned leader until falling ill in 2006. In 2008, he handed over the presidency to his younger brother Raul, who had fought alongside him during the revolution.

Raul succeeded him as head of the party in 2011. Fidel Castro died in 2016.

For most of his life, Raul played second-string to his brother Fidel — first as a guerrilla commander, later as a senior figure in their socialist government. But for the past decade, it's Raul who has been the face of communist Cuba and its defiance of U.S. efforts to oust its socialist system.

The fourth of seven children of a Spanish immigrant in eastern Cuba, Raul had joined his charismatic older brother in a nearly suicidal attack on the Moncada military barracks in the eastern city of Santiago in 1953 and survived the crackdown that followed from the forces of Batista.

He led a major front in the ensuing guerrilla war led by Fidel that toppled Batista, and later served as head of the armed forces. For many years, he was considered a more orthodox communist than his brother.

But it was Raul who reached accords with U.S. President Barack Obama in 2014 that created the most extensive U.S. opening to Cuba since the early 1960s — creating a surge in contacts with the United States that was largely reversed under Obama's successor, Donald Trump.

Now, with Raul Castro stepping down as party leader amid change and challenges, some say the island needs continuity going forward.

""All process have a continuity and I think Díaz-Canel should be there now,"" said 58-year-old driver Miguel Rodríguez.",809,4885,9,53
0,Health official alleges ‘sexual slavery’ in Tigray; women blame soldiers,https://www.reuters.com/world/special-report-health-official-alleges-sexual-slavery-tigray-women-blame-2021-04-15/,"An Ethiopian woman who says she was gang-raped by armed men is seen during an interview with Reuters in a hospital in the town of Adigrat, Tigray region, Ethiopia, March 18, 2021. REUTERS/Baz Ratner

The young mother was trying to get home with food for her two children when she says soldiers pulled her off a minibus in Ethiopia’s Tigray region, claiming it was overloaded.

It was the beginning of an 11-day ordeal in February, during which she says she was repeatedly raped by 23 soldiers who forced nails, a rock and other items into her vagina, and threatened her with a knife.

Doctors showed Reuters the bloodstained stone and two 3-inch nails they said they had removed from her body.

The woman, 27, is among hundreds who have reported that they were subjected to horrific sexual violence by Ethiopian and allied Eritrean soldiers after fighting broke out in November in the mountainous northern region of Ethiopia, doctors said.

Some women were held captive for extended periods, days or weeks at a time, said Dr Fasika Amdeselassie, the top public health official for the government-appointed interim administration in Tigray.

“Women are being kept in sexual slavery,” Fasika told Reuters. “The perpetrators have to be investigated.”

Reports of rape have been circulating for months. But Fasika’s assertion, based on women’s accounts, marks the first time an Ethiopian official - in this case, a top regional health officer - has made a sexual slavery accusation in connection with the conflict in Tigray.

loading

In addition, eight other doctors at five public hospitals told Reuters that most of the rape victims described their attackers as either Ethiopian government soldiers or Eritrean troops. It was more common for women to report sexual violence by Eritrean soldiers, the doctors said.

The Eritreans have been helping Ethiopia’s central government fight the region’s former ruling party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), in the conflict plaguing the Horn of Africa nation.

Taken together, the descriptions paint the most detailed picture to date of the sexual violence against women in Tigray and the military’s alleged involvement in it.

Most people interviewed for this article declined to be identified. They said they feared reprisals, including possible violence, by soldiers who guard the hospitals and towns.

Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed acknowledged in a speech to parliament on March 23 that “atrocities were being committed by raping women” and promised that the perpetrators would be punished. He did not identify the alleged perpetrators.

He said then for the first time that Eritrean soldiers had entered the conflict in Tigray in support of the Ethiopian government after the TPLF attacked military bases across the region in the early hours of Nov. 4. Ethiopia’s government had previously denied this, and the Eritrean government still does not acknowledge their troops' presence. The TPLF was the dominant power in the central government when Eritrea fought a bloody border war with Ethiopia a generation ago.

Neither the Ethiopian nor the Eritrean governments responded to Reuters’ questions about specific cases raised by women and their doctors, or about the accusation of sexual slavery. No charges have been announced by civilian or military prosecutors against any soldiers. However, officials in both countries emphasized that their governments have zero tolerance for sexual violence - a point Abiy’s spokeswoman, Billene Seyoum, said the prime minister reiterated recently in discussions with military leaders.

The alleged sexual violence has drawn international attention.

Billene said the United Nations, the African Union and Ethiopia’s state-appointed human rights commission have been authorized to carry out joint investigations into alleged abuses by all sides in the conflict. That includes the “criminal clique,” she said, referring to the TPLF.

An Ethiopian military spokesman and the head of a government task force on the Tigray crisis did not respond to phone calls and text messages seeking comment. Reuters could not reach military leaders in either country.

Asked about the reports that Eritrean troops have committed rapes in Tigray and are keeping women in sexual slavery, the country’s information minister, Yemane Gebremeskel, accused TPLF activists of “coaching ‘sympathizers’ to create false testimonies.”

“All the fabricated stories - which are alien to our culture and laws - are peddled to cover up the crimes of the TPLF which started the war,” he told Reuters in a written response.

Reuters was unable to reach a TPLF spokesman.

RECORDS OF ABUSE

Fasika, the health official, said at least 829 cases of sexual assault have been reported at the five hospitals since the conflict in Tigray began.

Those cases were likely “the tip of the iceberg,” Fasika said. Rape is underreported in Ethiopia because it carries a huge stigma. Also, most of the region’s health facilities are no longer functioning, and travel between towns remains dangerous, he said.

Most of the women who have come forward are either pregnant or sustained severe physical injury from the rapes, Fasika said.

Reuters interviewed 11 women who said they had been raped by soldiers from Eritrea, Ethiopia or both. Four said they were kidnapped, taken to military camps and gang raped, in some cases alongside other women. The women did not know the camp names but said they were located near Mekelle and the towns of Idaga Hamus, Wukro and Sheraro.

Five other women said they were held in fields or deserted houses for up to six days. And two said they were raped in their own homes.

Reuters could not independently verify their accounts. However, all told similar stories of being beaten and brutalized. Healthcare providers confirmed that the 11 women’s injuries were consistent with the events they described, and they showed Reuters medical records for three of the women detailing their conditions.

The healthcare providers also shared details of nine other cases of sexual assault, including the ordeals of two 14-year-old girls.

Although Ethiopia’s government declared victory over the TPLF in November, fighting continues in some areas, and medical workers say new rapes are reported at the region’s health facilities every day.

“This is being done to dishonour the women, to break their pride,” said a doctor at Ayder Referral Hospital, in Mekelle, citing the brutality of the attacks and humiliation of victims. ""This is not for sexual gratification. The rapes are to punish Tigray.""

‘TELL MY STORY’

The 27-year-old mother said uniformed soldiers from Eritrea pulled her off a minibus on the road from Mekelle to the city of Adigrat on Feb. 6. They tied her up and marched her through fields to a bush camp, she said. After 11 days of rapes and beatings, she said, the soldiers forced nails, cotton, plastic bags and a rock into her vagina and left her alone in the bush.

Villagers found her unconscious and brought her to a nearby hospital.

She said she was still bleeding from severe internal injuries and could not control her urine, walk without a crutch or sit up for long periods. One leg was broken, she said.

She also described a different kind of pain: While in the hospital, she has no way to speak to her 4-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter because the Eritrean soldiers took her cell phone. She had left the children with her mother to search for food and never returned. At the time, the family had less than a week’s worth of bread.

""I don’t know anything, if they are dead or alive,"" she said. ""The enemy destroyed my life.""

A 32-year-old mother in Mekelle told Reuters that soldiers removed her from a minibus on the same road at the end of February. They were dressed in Ethiopian uniforms, she said, but spoke with an Eritrean accent and had traditional facial scarification typical of the neighbouring country. She said they shot her 12-year-old son dead in front of her, then brought her to a camp where she was held with other female captives and repeatedly raped for 10 days.

""Tell my story,"" she said. ""This is happening to women out there right now. I want this to end with me.""

A 28-year-old house cleaner said soldiers grabbed her from a street in Mekelle on the afternoon of Feb. 10 and took her to a field outside a military base where she was raped by more than 10 men wearing Ethiopian or Eritrean uniforms.

Wiping away tears, she said that during her two-week ordeal, soldiers doused her with alcohol and mocked her as they assaulted her. She escaped when her captors were distracted by gunfire, she said.

SHOT FOR RESISTING

The government has set up a task force separate from the human rights commission to investigate the reports of sexual violence. Its head, Mebrihit Assefa, said the body includes representatives from the regional health bureau, the attorney general’s office and federal police.

The task force plans to set up five centers where rape survivors can file reports with law enforcement and receive medical and psychosocial support.

“Our prosecutors (and) police officers are there to investigate all crimes committed, including sexual violence,” said Awol Sultan, a spokesman for the attorney general’s office.

He did not respond to questions about the women alleging they were raped during captivity, or whether prosecutors were in touch with either the Eritrean or Ethiopian militaries. The results of the criminal investigations will be released publicly at an unspecified date, he said.

Abera Nigus, the head of Tigray’s justice bureau, said the legal process was likely to be complicated because most courts are not functioning in Tigray, and many rape victims cannot identify their assailants.

Knowing their rapists are still at large also has discouraged women from seeking help, doctors said.

Many of the women who sought treatment at hospitals had vaginal and anal tears, sexually transmitted diseases and injuries that rendered them incontinent, said the Ayder hospital doctor, an obstetrician gynecologist. The doctor shared notes from 11 cases the hospital had treated involving women raped by soldiers.

One woman had been gang raped on three separate occasions, according to the hospital notes.

Another was five months pregnant when she was raped, the notes indicate. Two 14-year-old girls were sexually assaulted in front of their families. One girl had a hand and foot amputated.

She had been shot for resisting her assailant.

Myanmar’s shadow government has urged Southeast Asian leaders to give it a seat at the table during crisis talks next week, and not to recognise the military rulers that seized power in a February coup.

Military government leader Senior General Min Aung Hlaing is expected to join a special ASEAN summit on Myanmar on Saturday in Jakarta, Indonesia – his first official overseas trip since the coup that overthrew civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

Moe Zaw Oo, deputy minister of foreign affairs for the parallel “national unity government” – formed on Friday by overthrown politicians mostly from Aung San Suu Kyi’s party, as well as ethnic-minority politicians – said ASEAN had not reached out to them.

“If ASEAN wants to help solve the Myanmar situation, they are not going to achieve anything without consulting and negotiating with the NUG, which is supported by the people and has full legitimacy,” he told Voice of America’s Burmese service on Sunday.

“It’s important that this military council is not recognised. This needs to be handled carefully.”

On Saturday, Thai foreign ministry spokesman Tanee Sangrat said several leaders of the 10 ASEAN countries, including Min Aung Hlaing, had confirmed they would attend the April 24 meeting in Jakarta.

The military strongman’s invitation has drawn scorn from activists who have urged foreign leaders not to formally recognise the military government.

The Southeast Asian nation has been in upheaval since the coup on February 1.

Security forces have killed at least 730 pro-democracy protesters, according to an activist group, in an attempt to crush nationwide anti-coup protests.

Meanwhile, security forces also continued targeting the media on Sunday, arresting Japanese freelance reporter Yuki Kitazumi.

He was arrested at his home in Yangon on Sunday evening, his assistant said in a message.

In February, he was beaten up and briefly detained during a crackdown on protesters but was later released.

The number of reporters arrested so far has totalled more than 65 and at least 34 remain in custody, according to monitoring group Reporting ASEAN.

Authorities announced on Sunday night on state-run television another 20 celebrities and 20 more doctors would be added to their arrest warrant list of 420 prominent people.

Protests continue

Earlier unrest continued across the country on Sunday, with protesters rallying in Mandalay, Meiktila, Magway and Myingyan, showing support for the national unity government.

At Palaw in the country’s south, demonstrators brandished banners that read: “Military dictators should not be allowed to rule. The dictatorship will be uprooted. Support the national unity government.”

Young demonstrators also staged motorbike rallies while carrying flags in Hpakant and Sagaing.

The previous night, there were violent clashes in the central gem-producing city of Mogok when security forces cracked down on protesters.

According to an AFP news agency-verified video filmed by a resident, soldiers crouched on a street as their commanding officer shouted that he wanted “deaths”.

The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) verified two deaths at Mogok.

Late on Saturday, a young man was shot and killed in Kyaukme town in northern Shan state while riding his motorbike during the curfew.

“He was shot by the authorities when he and other his friends drove motorbikes around 9pm. He was shot in the head,” a rescue worker told AFP news agency, adding that his funeral would take place on Sunday.

'We are again reminded of how dangerous the virus can be and how important it is that we endure the strict measure for a while longer.'

Gatherings have been banned in the area since March 16 in a bid to curb infections.

On Wednesday, 599 new cases of coronavirus were reported in Norway along with 18 deaths.

Some 106,000 infections have been recorded in the country since the pandemic began last spring, with 706 deaths reported.

The U.S. Department of State said it is expelling 10 officials from Russia’s bilateral mission.

""Today, we announced actions to hold the Russian Government to account for the SolarWinds intrusion, reports of bounties on U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan, and attempts to interfere in the 2020 U.S. elections,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.

SECRETARY OF STATE BLINKEN VISITS AFGHANISTAN IN SURPRISE TRIP AFTER BIDEN TROOP ANNOUNCEMENT

The White House also released a letter to Congress stating that the president has issued ""an Executive Order declaring a national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by specified harmful foreign activities of the Government of the Russian Federation.""

The letter said that Russia had aimed to ""undermine the conduct of free and fair democratic elections,"" engaged in ""malicious cyber-enabled activities,"" targeted journalists and dissenters outside of its borders, and violated international law.

This, Biden said in the letter, constitutes ""an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.""

Blinken's statement went into more detail, citing not only the SolarWinds hack that compromised many agencies in the federal government but also the poisoning of top Putin political rival Alexei Navalny.

""We remain concerned about Navalny’s health and treatment in prison, and call for his unconditional release,"" Blinken said. Navalny is currently in the custody of the Russian government and reported not to be well. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki previously said that ""[t]he Russian government is responsible for his health and well-being.""

Blinken also emphasized Thursday, however, ""the United States will also seek opportunities for cooperation with Russia, with the goal of building a more stable and predictable relationship consistent with U.S. interests.""

Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov, according to the Russian state-run media organization TASS, said ""[w]e condemn any pursuit of sanctions, we consider them illegal. In any case, the principle of reciprocity in this matter is valid; reciprocity in a way that best serves our interests.""

""It goes without saying that possible sanctions being discussed would by no means promote such a meeting,"" Peskov also said, regarding a potential in-person meeting between Putin and Biden.

Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova meanwhile said at a news conference that Russia has summoned the U.S. ambassador for a ""hard conversation,"" but didn't immediately detail specific retaliatory actions from Russia.

The tough stance from the Biden administration comes as tensions have escalated between the U.S. and Russia during the president's first three months. Biden called Putin a killer in his first sit-down interview after taking office. Putin was reportedly so upset over the comment that he left his quarantine, got a COVID-19 vaccination and moved 28,000 Russian troops to the border with Ukraine.

Russian Bear bombers went into action, forcing NATO to scramble 10 jets to intercept the Russian warplanes flying over the North Atlantic Ocean earlier this month, a rare show of force near the Arctic. Last week, Putin quietly changed Russia’s constitution to allow him to stay in power until 2036. He would be 83 years old.

0,Israel to Scrap Outdoor Mask Mandate from Sunday,https://english.aawsat.com/home/article/2922096/israel-scrap-outdoor-mask-mandate-sunday,"Israelis walk in Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market, on March 18, 2021 wearing the mandatory face mask as part of efforts by authorities to stem coronavirus - AFP

Asharq Al-Awsat

Israelis will no longer have to wear masks outdoors starting from Sunday as the number of virus infections plummets, Health Minister Yuli Edelstein said.

""The rate of infection in Israel is very low thanks to the successful vaccine campaign in Israel, and therefore it is possible to ease (restrictions),"" Edelstein said in a statement Thursday.

He said however that masks will still be required indoors.

With close to five million people -- more than half the population of 9.3 million -- vaccinated, Israel continues its world-beating campaign that sent coronavirus infection rates down, AFP reported.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu obtained millions of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines in part by agreeing to share with Pfizer medical data on the product's impact.

The vaccines have transformed life in Israel. In mid-January the country had a peak of some 10,000 new infections a day but the rate is now about 200 cases a day.

The rate of new infections has remained low even after in-person learning resumed and restrictions were loosened on bars, restaurants and indoor gatherings.

Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla was a guest of honor at a government ceremony Wednesday evening marking Israel's 73rd year of independence.

""Together we are demonstrating that through mass vaccinations we can defeat the Covid-19 pandemic and save lives,"" Bourla said in a video address.

Throughout the festivities marking independence day, thousands of people held barbecues, lounged on beaches and celebrated at parties, often without masks.

On Wednesday, Israel announced a plan to allow vaccinated foreign tourists to return in groups beginning May 23, more than a year after closing its borders to most tourists to prevent the spread of the virus.

Israel's easing of restrictions stands in contrast to the occupied West Bank and the blockaded Gaza Strip, where infection rates remain high and vaccinations are low.

Rights groups say Israel must supply vaccines to the 4.8 million Palestinians living there, but Israel says Palestinians must obtain their own shots.",352,2243,8,48

After almost two decades since the United States invaded Afghanistan and toppled the Taliban regime, Washington is set to exit the country. President Joe Biden has decided to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan by September 11.

The military withdrawal will not depend on the situation on the ground — despite fears that the Taliban could make major gains, many say.

“The president has judged that a conditions-based approach, which has been the approach of the past two decades, is a recipe for staying in Afghanistan forever,” an official told reporters on condition of anonymity on Tuesday.

Germany will match US plans for the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said in an interview on Wednesday. “We have always said we are going in together, and we are going out together,” Kramp-Karrenbauer told German public broadcaster ARD. “I stand for an orderly withdrawal, and I expect us to decide this today (at NATO).”

Former US President Donald Trump’s administration had set the pullout date for May 1, but Biden’s decision will delay the end of withdrawal by another five months. Biden’s complete and unconditional decision to withdraw comes as a surprise for many experts, who had hoped that his administration would reverse Trump’s policies, which many believe have emboldened Islamist militants in Afghanistan.

A victory for the Taliban?

Violent attacks in Afghanistan have spiked since the signing of the US-Taliban agreement in Doha, Qatar, in February 2020 to end the protracted war. The Taliban deny involvement in these attacks, but their refusal to agree to a nationwide ceasefire has raised doubts about their intentions.

The Islamist group, which feels more powerful than ever, also says it would not attend a planned summit in Turkey until all foreign troops leave the country.

“The result of the upcoming Afghan conference in Turkey will determine how the withdrawal of US troops will impact the future of the country,” Mohammad Shafiq Hamdam, a Kabul-based security expert, told DW. If the conference succeeds in forming a government that includes Taliban and other Afghans, then the damage of such a hurried exit from Afghanistan will be manageable, he continued. “But if the conference fails, and the Taliban continue to reject peace, I am afraid Afghanistan could face an all-out civil war.”

The US decision to pull out all troops from Afghanistan would also leave President Ashraf Ghani’s elected government at the mercy of militants. US intelligence has released a report finding that Afghanistan’s government would “struggle” to stand its ground against the “confident” Taliban.

The US national intelligence report states that the Taliban “is confident it can achieve military victory.”

“Afghan forces continue to secure major cities and other government strongholds, but they remain tied down in defensive missions and have struggled to hold recaptured territory or reestablish a presence in areas abandoned in 2020,” it said.

Analyst Hamdam says that Afghan security forces “are financially and militarily dependent on the US, and without its support, they will be in a tough spot.”

The Taliban are not the only threat to Afghan forces; other militant groups, such as “Islamic State” (IS), have also gained a foothold in the war-ravaged country.

“The Taliban are stronger than ever. IS and other terrorist groups have gained a foothold in Afghanistan. Therefore, the consequences of a hasty and irresponsible withdrawal from Afghanistan could be dangerous not only for Afghanistan but also for the region and the world,” Raihana Azad, a member of the Afghan parliament, told DW.

‘No excuse for war’

Concerns is great that gains made over the past two decades, especially in the area of women’s rights, could be lost as the Taliban unleash further violence. It is unclear whether the Taliban would agree to protecting human rights and freedom of speech in Afghanistan.

“The US has made too many concessions to the Taliban. The Afghan people will pay the price for it. They are disheartened and feel abandoned by the international community,” lawmaker Azad said.

Some experts hold the view that the withdrawal announcement could also put the Taliban into a difficult position. “By announcing an unconditional pullout, the US has accepted Taliban’s main demand. Now the international community expects the Taliban to join the political process. There is no excuse to continue the war,” Assadullah Nadim, a Kabul-based military expert, told DW.

Bigger role for Pakistan?

Biden’s decision to pull out troops from Afghanistan will also give an upper hand to regional players, which are vying for a bigger role in the country. Countries like Pakistan, India, China and Russia have their own strategic interests, which are better served without a US presence in Afghanistan.

Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, who held talks with his German counterpart Heiko Maas in Berlin earlier this week, told DW that Islamabad will remain an important player in the Afghan peace process.

“Pakistan will benefit from peace in Afghanistan. It will open the door to increased trade with Kabul, and many pending development projects can be completed,” he said.

Pakistan has been wary of an increased role of its regional rival India in Afghanistan since the US invaded Afghanistan in 2001.

Experts say that the 2020 US-Taliban deal would not have been possible without Islamabad’s backing. Pakistan has a considerable influence over the Taliban, and it played a key role in bringing the insurgents to the negotiating table.

Yet Pakistan wants a strong role for the Taliban in future Afghan governance. Its regional interests are better served with a powerful Taliban presence in its western neighborhood. This, however, would not guarantee peace in Afghanistan.

0,Peru’s Vizcarra banned from public office over vaccine scandal: Congress approved former president’s temporary ban from public office by 86 votes in favour and zero against.,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/17/perus-vizcarra-banned-from-public-office-over-vaccine-scandal,"Congress approved former president’s temporary ban from public office by 86 votes in favour and zero against.

Former Peruvian President Martín Vizcarra has been banned from holding public office for 10 years in a unanimous vote by the country’s congress after he allegedly jumped the queue to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

Vizcarra was found guilty of influence peddling, collusion and making false declarations in relation to Peru’s VIP Vaccines scandal which saw many ministers and public officials receive Sinopharm vaccines before they were publicly available in the country.

Congress approved his temporary banning from public office by 86 votes in favour and zero against.

It also disqualified the former Health Minister Pilar Mazzetti from holding public office for eight years; and former Foreign Minister Elizabeth Astete for a year.

Both former ministers received the vaccine and resigned during the subsequent scandal. However, all three have denied having used their positions to obtain early access to vaccines.

Vizcarra said in February he and his wife were inoculated in October of the previous year as volunteers for the Sinopharm trial in Peru – a claim the university hosting the trial denied.

The former president came to office in March 2018 on a promise to curb endemic corruption in public office and ran the country until being impeached by Congress in November last year on separate corruption charges, which he has continued to deny.

He had been due to take up a seat in Congress following elections in Peru at the weekend, having obtained the highest number of votes cast for any legislator.

Sinopharm’s clinical trials in Peru took place between September and the end of 2020 with about 12,000 volunteers. In addition, local managers of the trial received 3,200 additional doses intended for personnel related to the research, host university Cayetano Heredia said.

Peru heads for a second round of voting for president in June, with right-wing presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori going head-to-head with socialist Pedro Castillo, a previously little-known union leader and teacher, who shocked the Andean nation by taking 19.1 percent of the vote during the first round of ballot last Sunday.",352,2230,26,173

1,Ghost Of Christmas Future Taunts Children With Visions Of PlayStation 5 (From 2002),https://local.theonion.com/ghost-of-christmas-future-taunts-children-with-visions-1819566694,"SOUTHFIELD, MI—Bored with scaring elderly misers, the Ghost of Christmas Future is spending the holiday season taunting modern children with visions of Christmas 2016's hottest toy: the Sony PlayStation 5, a 2,048-bit console featuring a 45-Ghz trinary processor, CineReal graphics booster with 2-gig biotexturing, and an RSP connector for 360-degree online-immersion play.

The Ghost of Christmas Future offers a pair of Phoenix 10-year-olds a tantalizing glimpse of the PS5.

""You know how kids are—a year is an eternity to them,"" the wraithlike specter said Monday during a visit to the Southfield home of 13-year-old Josh Kuehn. ""So just imagine showing them something they'll have to wait 14 years for. Teasing them with a glimpse of the PS5 is the ultimate torture. They absolutely lose their minds. It's like saying, 'Hey, kid, you'll be an old man before you ever get to touch this.'""

The Ghost of Christmas Future said he has visited more than 125,000 homes since Thanksgiving, offering children an agonizing sneak peek at what they cannot have for another decade and a half.

""I like to appear in the living room with a PS5 hooked up to 2016's most popular TV, the 4'x8' Hi-Def Sony Titania,"" the Ghost said. ""Then, I'll say in my best spooky voice, 'Jimmy! Behold what your kids will be playing while you're slaving away at an office job to support them!'""

Driving the children mad with PS5 lust, the Ghost said, is a multi-step process.

""I usually start by showing them Toteki Aluminum, one of the future's most popular fight-and-chase games,"" the Ghost said. ""It's far from the best available in 2016, but it always blows their mind to see the guy get hit with the falling sign while the drops of sweat fly off his face. You can see the whole scene, distorted, in each of the individual drops. That gives them a good preliminary idea of the graphics technology we're dealing with.""

The Ghost said he then likes to show Airsledz, a racing game in which jet-powered sleds whoosh through a four-dimensional racing course in the sky. The game, he said, enables the player to compete online against dozens of other players all around the world.

""They always ask if you can play it on the Internet—it's so cute how they still call it 'the Internet'—and I tell them, 'Hey, you can play this against 63 other PS5 owners simultaneously. At least you can in 14 years,'"" the Ghost said. ""And you should see their jaws hit the floor when they learn about the add-on accessories that enable users to actually fly around the room during gameplay.""

Once the capabilities of the system are conveyed to the children, the Ghost likes to push them further over the edge by showing them games specially targeted to their age group.

Younger children, he said, salivate upon seeing Level One of Zonic Fugue. In it, Zonic, the indigo-colored son of Sonic The Hedgehog, faces off against Chuckles The Echidna in a Terrordactyl sky-joust, attempting to earn the Ankle Rockets he needs to gather the five Chaos Sapphires that, when combined, form the master key that opens the Melody Dome.

To break the spirits of children 12 and up, the Ghost runs a brief demonstration of Back To Werewolf Island. The horror-action thriller, he said, will be produced in full 10.8 Omneo sound and feature new music from 40 of 2016's hottest skagcore acts, including FU3P, Dredgerous, and Frances Cobain.

""Sometimes, the kids will start getting defensive and say, 'Yeah, well, I don't know any of those characters, so big deal,'"" the Ghost said. ""That's when I pull out DC vs. Marvel.""

The Ghost said he shows the children a brief clip of DC vs. Marvel, in which cinema-realistic figures of Spider-Man and the Joker dash across impossibly detailed city streets, attacking each other with dozens of different offensive maneuvers while leaping, somersaulting, and throwing objects.

""They usually start trembling at that point,"" the Ghost said. ""That's when I go in for the kill by casually mentioning that the game comes packaged with the 2016 feature film of the same name—not on DVD, of course, but on SCAP. Ten times better.""

The few children unbroken by DC vs. Marvel are invariably finished off by the sight of Star Wars—Episode IX: Jedi Destiny, a game which employs the world's most advanced artificial-intelligence algorithm to place the player inside the film's climactic battle sequence on the planet Mon Jeedam.

""With more than 12,000 distinct soldiers, creatures, and vehicles fighting at once, and the option to command the New Republic Fleet, the Imperial Armada, or the Yuuzhan Vong Invasion Force, it's not merely the best Star Wars game that's ever existed; it's an interactive film that looks better than any movie that's ever been made. No child has failed to sob hysterically at the sight of it.""

MOSCOW (AP) — Russia on Friday responded to a barrage of new U.S. sanctions by saying it would expel 10 U.S. diplomats and take other retaliatory moves in a tense showdown with Washington.

The Russian Foreign Ministry also published a list of eight current or former U.S. officials barred from entering the country, including U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, FBI Director Christopher Wray, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas.

Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also said Moscow will move to shut down those U.S. nongovernment organizations that remain in Russia to end what he described as their meddling in Russia’s politics.

The top Russian diplomat said the Kremlin suggested that U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan follow the example of his Russian counterpart and head home for consultations. Russia will also deny the U.S. Embassy the possibility of hiring personnel from Russia and third countries as support staff, limit visits by U.S. diplomats serving short-term stints at the embassy, and tighten requirements for U.S. diplomats' travel in the country.

The others banned from entering Russia are Susan Rice, a former U.N. ambassador and now head of the Domestic Policy Council; John Bolton, who was a national security adviser under former President Donald Trump; James Woolsey, a former CIA director; and Michael Carvajal, director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

On Thursday, the Biden administration announced sanctions on Russia for interfering in the 2020 U.S. presidential election and involvement in the SolarWind hack of federal agencies — activities Moscow has denied. The U.S. ordered 10 Russian diplomats expelled, targeted dozens of companies and people, and imposed new curbs on Russia’s ability to borrow money.

While the U.S. wields the power to cripple Russia's economy, Moscow lacks levers to respond in kind, although it could hurt American interests in other ways globally.

Lavrov called Washington’s move “absolutely unfriendly and unprovoked,"" and he said that while Russia could take “painful measures” against American business interests in Russia, it wouldn’t immediately move to do that and “save them for future use.”

He warned that if Washington further raises the pressure, Russia might ask the U.S. to reduce the number of its embassy and consular staff from about 450 to 300. He said both countries host about 450 diplomats, but that includes some 150 Russians at the U.N. in New York that he argued shouldn't be included.

Russia's economic potential and its global reach are limited compared with the Soviet Union that competed with the U.S for international influence during the Cold War. Still, Russia's nuclear arsenal and its leverage in many parts of the world make it a power that Washington needs to reckon with.

Aware of that, President Joe Biden called for de-escalating tensions and held the door open for cooperation with Russia in certain areas. Biden said he told Putin in Tuesday's call that he chose not to impose tougher sanctions for now and proposed to meet in a third country in the summer.

Lavrov said Russia had a “positive attitude” to the summit offer and was analyzing it, but a statement issued by the Foreign Ministry shortly after noted that it ”was being studied in the context of the evolving situation.""

The ministry charged that Russia would like to avoid further escalation and engage in a “calm and professional dialogue,” but has other means to retaliate if Washington tries to crank up the pressure.

While the new U.S. sanctions further limited Russia’s ability to borrow money by banning U.S. financial institutions from buying Russian government bonds directly from state institutions, they didn't target the secondary market.

“It’s very important that there’re no sanctions on secondary debt because that means that non-U.S. persons can buy the debt and sell it to the U.S. persons,” said Tom Adshead, director of research at Macro-Advisory Ltd, an analytics and advisory company.

Timothy Frye, a Columbia University political scientist, noted that Biden chose not to target the prospective Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline to Germany or go after large Russian state-controlled companies.

""That’s part of the broader strategy of using sanctions but also reaching out to the Kremlin to propose talks on strategic stability and eventually on a summit,” he said.

Tougher restrictions would also hurt Western businesses, inflict significant economic pain on ordinary Russians and allow Putin to rally anti-U.S. sentiments to shore up his rule.

Ramping up sanctions could eventually drive Russia into a corner and provoke even more reckless Kremlin action, leading to a potential escalation in Ukraine, which has seen a surge in clashes with Russia-backed separatists in the east and a massive Russian troop buildup across the border.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was in Paris on Friday to discuss the tensions with French President Emmanuel Macron. After a joint call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the three urged Russia to pull back its troops to de-escalate the situation.

Fyodor Lukyanov, a top foreign policy expert who leads the Moscow-based Council for Foreign and Defense Policies, predicted Putin would likely accept Biden's invitation to join next week’s call on climate change but could drag his feet on the summit offer.

“There is no way to make any deals,” Lukyanov said. “There is a mutual antipathy and a total lack of trust.”

He said the only practical outcome of the summit could be an agreement to launch long and difficult talks on a replacement to the New START nuclear reduction agreement that Russia and the U.S. extended in February for another five years.

Lukyanov noted that the growing U.S. pressure will push Russia and China closer in the long run.

“Closer cooperation with China on coordinating actions to contain the United States will develop more quickly now as the Chinese are interested in that,” he said. While Russia lacks tools for a symmetrical answer to the U.S. sanctions, “it has ample capabilities to stimulate changes in the world order,” he added.

Konstantin Kosachev, the Kremlin-connected deputy speaker of the upper house of parliament, said that by imposing sanctions and proposing a summit at the same time, the U.S. sought to take a commanding stance.

“Russia's consent would be interpreted as a reflection of its desire to soften the sanctions, allowing the U.S. to secure a dominant position at the meeting, while our refusal to meet would be a convenient pretext for more punitive measures,"" Kosachev wrote on Facebook.

He argued that Russia should not rush to accept Biden's summit offer.

“Revenge is a dish best served cold,” Kosachev wrote. “I believe the saying is quite adaptable to a situation when we talk not about revenge but a due answer to aggressive action by an opponent.”

Some predicted the U.S. sanctions could discourage Russia from cooperating with the U.S. on international crises.

“The Russian position will grow tougher on Syria, the Iranian nuclear deal and other issues,” Ivan Timofeev, program director at Russian International Affairs Council, said in a commentary. Instead of acting as a deterrent, he warned, the sanctions would “only anger Russia and make its policy even tougher.”

But despite the soaring tensions, Russia and the U.S. have shared interests in many global hot spots. For example, Moscow fears that instability could spread from Afghanistan to former Soviet republics in Central Asia, and it is interested in a political settlement there.

As for Iran, Moscow also doesn't want to see it with nuclear weapons, despite its friendly ties with Tehran.

Lukyanov said Russia wouldn't try to use global hot spots to hurt the U.S. and would wait patiently to see them erode U.S. domination.

“It's not a matter of playing the spoiler here or there,” he said. “The ongoing developments will help accelerate the process of consolidation of leading powers against the U.S. domination.”

LONDON — The head of the World Health Organization said Friday that an alarming rise in Covid cases has pushed global infections toward their highest level in the pandemic.

The study was published on the Public Library of Science's website after having been peer-reviewed.

""A unique odor associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection present in human urine as well as saliva, provides impetus for the development of odor-based screening – either by electronic, chemical, or biological sensing methods,"" researchers stated in the study.

However, there is a certain concern for training such dogs, because since the ultimate goal would be for them to detect COVID-positive patients in a public setting and not from such samples, such training would be dangerous, as they would need to be trained around people who have tested positive for coronavirus.

However, researchers expressed concern over the method of providing samples used in training the dogs, as they could possibly get accustomed to specific samples rather than some sort of trademark scent of a COVID-positive sample.

""Future training of dogs and investigation into biological, chemical and electronic detectors should focus on increasing the number of relevant and novel samples,"" the study states.

“We did a study where we had dogs sniffing samples from COVID-positive patients and we can say they have a 94% probability in our study... that they can sniff them out,” said Holger Volk, head of the veterinary clinic.

“So dogs can really sniff out people with infections and without infections, as well as asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID patients,” he added.

In Finland, dogs trained to detect the novel coronavirus began sniffing passenger samples at Finland’s Helsinki-Vantaa Airport last September, in a pilot project alongside more usual testing there.

Chile’s international airport in Santiago is also using canine detectors.

A study published in March found that Thai sniffer dogs trained to detect COVID-19 in human sweat proved nearly 95% accurate during training and could be used to identify coronavirus infections at busy transport hubs within seconds.

“The dogs take only one to two seconds to detect the virus,” Professor Kaywalee Chatdarong, leader of the project at the veterinary faculty of Thailand’s Chulalongkorn University, told Reuters.

“Within a minute, they will manage to go through 60 samples.”

The dogs can detect a volatile organic compound secreted in the sweat of COVID-19 sufferers, even in the absence of disease symptoms, the Thai researcher said.

Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) failed to choose Nigeria for its first African office because the media misrepresents the country, its information minister said on Thursday, citing coverage of police reform protests last year.

The social media giant on Monday said it would set up its first office on the continent in neighbouring Ghana, as the company seeks to make inroads in some of the world's fastest-growing markets. read more

Nigeria, Africa's biggest economy, has a thriving technology sector that has attracted international investors but faces numerous security challenges including a decade-long Islamist insurgency in the northeast, mass abductions from schools in the northwest and piracy in the Gulf of Guinea.

Rights group Amnesty said soldiers and police shot dead at least 12 people on Oct. 20 after largely peaceful protests calling for police reforms in the wake of alleged brutality turned violent. The military and police deny the allegations.

""This is what you get when you de-market your own country,"" Information Minister Lai Mohammed told reporters, in a video posted on Twitter by his ministry, when asked about Twitter's decision.

""Nigerian journalists were...painting Nigeria as a hell where nobody should live,"" he said of coverage of the protests in which Twitter users coalesced behind the #EndSARS hashtag in reference to the widely feared Special Anti-Robbery Squad that was disbanded after abuse allegations surfaced.

""The natural expectation would have been for Nigeria to be the hub for Twitter in this part of Africa,"" said Mohammed.

In the weeks before the shootings, protesters used social media to organise, raise money and share what they said was proof of police harassment. Twitter's CEO, Jack Dorsey, tweeted to encourage his followers to contribute to the protests using bitcoin.

Mohammed, days after the circulation of images, video and an Instagram live feed of the incident, said ""some form of regulation"" could be imposed on social media to combat ""fake news"".

Twitter described Ghana as ""a champion for democracy"" and ""a supporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet"".

1,Disney Estate Uncovers Cache Of Anti-American Cartoons Intended For Release If Axis Won WWII,https://entertainment.theonion.com/disney-estate-uncovers-cache-of-anti-american-cartoons-1833665457,"A still from an animated short that featured Goofy portraying an effeminate, weak FDR whose pants constantly fell down when he attempted to rise from his wheelchair.

SAN FRANCISCO—In a shocking discovery certain to complicate the legacy of a national icon, the estate of Walt Disney announced Friday it had discovered a cache of anti-American cartoons the pioneering animator intended to release if the Axis Powers had triumphed in World War II.

The newfound materials reveal that in 1942, as Hitler’s war machine was nearing the height of its European occupation, Disney ordered his studio to produce animated propaganda praising a global empire ruled by Germany, Italy, and Japan. Hidden away in a vault for nearly 75 years—and starring classic characters such as Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck—the never-before-seen shorts and feature-length works depict Americans as lazy, corrupt, and inferior to the morally upstanding German patriots who will soon conquer them.

“There are hours of cartoons in which Mickey and the gang teach American children that U.S. soldiers were cowardly murderers and a worldwide Jewish conspiracy was responsible for the war,” said Walt Disney Family Museum curator Eileen Bryant as she described Wehrmacht Duck, which features Nazi paratrooper Donald shouting “Blood and soil!” as he lands in an American town, distributes copies of Mein Kampf to teachers, and lectures Nordic-looking children on racial hygiene. “Walt wanted to cover all his bases in the event of an Allied surrender. If the D-Day invasion had failed, he would have sent his first short, U-Boat Willie, directly to Joseph Goebbels.”

“He just wanted to make sure his production company had distribution and a market, whether he was living under a sovereign American government or Hitler’s thousand-year Reich,” she added.

Title card from the 1943 Huey, Dewey, and Louie short The Third Reich Is All-Reich With Me.

The Disney estate confirmed one of the features found in the vault is a remake of Fantasia in which Jewish composer Paul Dukas’ “Sorcerer’s Apprentice” is replaced with an all-Wagner score. The revised story reportedly centers around a young Mickey Mouse who, upon discovering his true Aryan heritage in a dream, reawakens as an Übermaus and begins goose-stepping in time to the increasingly feverish music. Documents indicate that following an Axis victory, Disney would have had the movie screened in every theater across North America, along with a re-cut version of Bambi that depicts the title character’s mother and all the forest animals as genetically defective creatures who are rightfully slaughtered by the film’s heroic hunters.

According to studio memos, all screenings would begin with a featurette in which FDR—portrayed by Goofy as an effeminate weakling whose pants fall down to the sound of a slide whistle every time he attempts to rise from his wheelchair—is sent to a camp for liquidation.

“A lot of these cartoons were aimed at convincing Americans of German heritage they were victims of a Jewish-led assault on their culture, especially the shorts starring Heinrich, Diedrick, and Ludwig,” said Bryant, referencing the duckling brothers better known as Huey, Dewey, and Louie. “In 1943’s The Third Reich Is All-Reich With Me, the brothers are rewarded for alerting their Waffen-SS uncle Donald to the secret hiding place of Pluto the Plutocrat, a dog with a Star of David pendant hanging from his collar. As a show of gratitude, the Gestapo decides to make them honorary secret police-ducks.”

Estate officials confirmed the collection also contains propaganda intended to prepare Americans for a Nazi occupation, including a public service announcement in which Minnie Mouse, an emblem of Aryan motherhood who has renounced her U.S. citizenship, is seen embroidering the words “Long live our glorious Führer” on a shawl. She tells viewers how proud she is to be raising children for the Fatherland and encourages American-born members of the master race to begin assembling baptismal records so their new masters can verify the purity of their blood.

“All these works, along with Walt’s early concept art of a swastika-festooned Epcot Center, were locked away after V-E Day,” Bryant said. “By today’s standards, they of course seem bigoted, even hateful, but it’s important to view them within the historical context in which they were made.”

“Except all the Japanese stuff,” Bryant continued. “Those caricatures were super racist even when they were supposed to be the good guys.”",723,4587,14,92

0,Oil firm bosses’ pay ‘incentivises them to undermine climate action’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/15/oil-firm-ceos-pay-is-an-incentive-to-resist-climate-action-study-finds,"Lucrative pay and share options have created an incentive for oil company executives to resist climate action, according to a study that casts doubt on recent net-zero commitments by BP and Shell.

Compensation packages for CEOs, often in excess of $10m (£7.2m), are linked to continued extraction of fossil fuels, exploration of new fields and the promotion of strong market demand through advertising, lobbying and government subsidies, the report says.

The setup with executives runs counter to efforts around the world to keep global heating to 1.5-2C (2.7-3.6F) above pre-industrial levels.

Boardroom rewards also underpin a skewed corporate logic that is slowing the world’s path to decarbonisation, according to the study, which was exclusively shared with the Guardian before publication in the Energy Research and Social Science journal.

Richard Heede, of the Climate Accountability Institute in the US, a co-author of the paper, said the discovery showed that the need for changes in corporate structures was more urgent than consumer behaviour changes.

“We show that executives have personal ownership of tens or hundreds of thousands of shares, which creates an unacknowledged personal desire to explore, extract and sell fossil fuels,” Heede said. “That carbon mindset needs to be revised by realigning compensation towards success in lowering absolute emissions.”

The study tracks ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell and BP – four of the biggest “carbon major” oil companies – since 1990. This was around the time the global public heard the first high-profile warning about the dangers of burning fossil fuels.

Executives had been told of the threat many years earlier, but instead of working on a transition to cleaner, safer forms of energy, they ramped up production, played down risks and adopted public relations campaigns that misleadingly presented oil companies as part of the solution rather than the source of the problem.

Between 1990 and 2019 the four companies made a combined profit of about $2tn. A minuscule fraction of these funds has been invested in low-carbon energy.

ExxonMobil allocated 0.22% of its capital expenditure to low-carbon energy in the eight years until 2018. The share at Chevron was almost identical. Shell managed 1.3% and BP 2.3%. None were aligned with a 1.5C pathway, the report says.

Instead, the overwhelming bulk of the profits was either ploughed back into oil and gas extraction, invested in buying back shares, paid out in dividends to shareholders or used to lobby politicians, undermine climate science and pay for greenwashing advertisements.

In the US, lobbying expenditures for the four companies totalled $731m between 1998 and 2019. Their corporate political donations in the US, stretching back to 1990, were worth $59m.

As public pressure and scientific evidence strengthened, the big four moved through the gears, the study asserts. “Business as usual” (pretending no problem existed) in the 1980s became “incremental adaptation” (casting doubt on the science as an excuse to move slowly) in the 1990s and early 2000s, and has today turned into “partial diversification” (accepting the science, but moving gradually towards long-term goals).

Despite the change in tactics and public rhetoric, the long-term strategy was always the same: securing a social licence to extract oil and gas. All four companies plan to continue extracting fossil fuels after 2050.

The co-author of the paper, Dario Kenner of the University of Sussex, said Shell’s and BP’s recent announcement of a net-zero goal by 2050, and Exxon’s and Chevron’s endorsement of carbon pricing, should be seen as similar tactics.

Kenner said: “When BP, Shell and others talk of net zero, they are trying to stay part of the decision-making process. They want to be in charge of the transition as much as possible so they can slow it down – that is the whole point of trying to convince society to trust them.”

He added that comparisons of the targets set by individual companies were a distraction from the more important role the government should play.

“It can’t be just about what Shell is doing or BP. It must be industry-wide. And should be about acting on climate science and phasing out oil and gas in line with a 1.5C target.” He said executive fortunes depended, however, on continuing production and sales.

The study examines the high levels of boardroom pay that motivate individuals to continue corporate practices that are destabilising the climate.

At least seven executives received more than $10m in 2018, the most recent year covered by the study. Shell’s CEO, Ben van Beurden, was the top earner with $23,069,040.

Stock options make up a growing share of that compensation, which the study authors say encourages executives to use profits for share buybacks rather than investment in renewable energy.

Another dataset ranks the carbon weight of each senior executive’s shareholdings, based on the amount of oil and gas the company has pumped out of the ground in a given year. In 2018, John Watson, the CEO of Chevron, topped this list with a personal emissions share of more than 600,000 tonnes, which is more than 100,000 times that of the average UK citizen.

“This paper shines a light on incentives in corporations that may not align with their public commitments to get to net zero by 2050,” Heede said. “Companies need to review compensation and align it with low-carbon reinvestment targets.”

He acknowledged that recent announcements by Shell and BP go further than US companies in investment in renewables and pay structures, but said transition plans across the industry needed to give detail on absolute emissions reduction targets, and reinvestment plans, and firms should be more transparent and less reliant on tree-planting offsets.

Corporate lobbying and advertising should switch, Heede said, from greenwashing to frank recognition of the dangers of fossil fuels and promotion of clean alternatives.

The paper suggests they will need a push from outside. It concludes that oil and gas companies are ill-structured for decarbonisation at the speed and scale demanded by climate science. “This raises the need for further external pressure, in particular by governments.”

In the past two years, there have been some changes, though the pace varies from company to company. Shell told the Guardian it had introduced an energy transition performance metric that was now worth 20% of its long-term incentive plan. “We were the first major energy company to connect executive pay to the energy transition in this way,” a spokesperson said. This February, Shell said the pay of more than 16,500 staff was now linked to a set of short- and long-term decarbonisation targets. The company said there was no longer a link between production volumes and executive renumeration.

Chevron said the conclusions of the study were inaccurate and misleading. “Executive compensation is determined by the independent directors of the board, advised by an independent compensation consultant. Our programme design aligns with shareholder interests and supports the company’s focus on ‘higher returns, lower carbon’. Energy transition performance measures are directly tied to the compensation of our executives and most of our employees in the company’s annual bonus programme,” a spokesperson said. The company said it was working to help the world achieve lower-carbon energy by increasing the use of renewables and offsets and investing in low-carbon technologies.



ExxonMobil said its compensation programme was designed to incentivise actions that create sustainable shareholder value based on careful consideration of current and future risks, such as those related to climate change. In a statement, it said executive pay was aligned with the results of their decisions and the returns of shareholders over the long term.



The authors of the new report said Shell, and to a lesser degree BP, had increased low-carbon investments, but its measures were still insufficient to meet the 1.5C target without significant emissions overshoot. The US firms, they said, were much further behind in responding to the risks. The key was an industry-wide approach in line with global climate governance rather than voluntary commitments that could be rolled back later, as has happened in the past, the authors of the report said.



“Our study clearly shows why it is time to stop spending so much time being distracted by what these companies promise,” Kenner said. “We should instead be discussing more the role of policymakers.”

BP said its remuneration policy supports the company’s goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 of earlier in line with Paris targets. A spokesman said this will involve the most extensive transformation in BP’s history. “By 2030, the strategy aims to increase our investment in low carbon energy to $5 billion a year, to have developed 50GW of renewable generating capacity, and to have reduced BP’s upstream oil and gas production by 40%.”",1435,9058,10,68

The Chinese flights came a day after the US secretary of state warned Beijing that Washington was committed to the defense of the democratic, self-governed island, which China considers part of its sovereign territory.

The 25 planes dispatched by China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) forces included 14 J-16 fighter jets, four J-10 fighter jets, four H-6K bombers, two anti-submarine warfare planes and an airborne early warning and control plane, according to Taiwan's Defense Ministry.

The EU agreed in July to tap financial markets in search of 750 billion euros ($898 billion) to distribute across the 27 nations and prop up their economies after the coronavirus shock. However, in order to receive these funds, countries have had to detail how they will be using them — a process that has not yet concluded. In addition, the German constitutional court threw a curveball at the process. Last month, it raised doubts about it and effectively halted the necessary legislative steps in Germany, before the funds could be released. ""We of course have followed quite closely the developments by the court ruling in Germany. To a certain extent they are stipulating what many critics say that there is a danger to implementing temporary measures in a permanent way,"" Gernot BlümeI, the finance minister of Austria, told CNBC on Friday.

I am convinced there will be no delay to be able to also emit those European bonds. Gernot BlümeI finance minister of Austria

The German court acted after a group called the Citizens' Will Alliance complained that the EU treaties did not allow the bloc to take on debt jointly. The German judges said that the federal government should ensure that borrowing at the EU level ""does not become a permanent solution"" — an opinion shared by Austria. ""I can understand what the German court said and in some parts I agree,"" he said, adding that Austria is ""a little bit more skeptical when it comes to a permanent mutualization of debts within the European Union"" in comparison with France and Germany. ""That's not what the Union was designed for. And we have now taken crisis combatting measures. But per (its) definition a crisis is a temporary situation, so the measures that we have put up to fight this crisis have also a temporary motive,"" BlümeI told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" Friday. There is another element needed before the funds can be released: All EU member states need to conclude the ratification process in their national parliaments. Austria is among the 10 EU nations that is yet to do that and without this, the EU cannot tap the debt markets. ""I am convinced there will be no delay to be able to also emit those European bonds because it is an important measure to re-boost the European economy,"" Austria's finance chief said when asked why his country had not taken this step yet.

""We have agreed on those measures, Austria is paying a big share of 12 billion euros into this pot and we do this because we think it is the right way to increase growth within the European market because all citizens of Europe will benefit from it,"" he added.

Nothing wrong with negotiating vaccines with Russia

Austria, just like other EU nations, has struggled to rapidly roll out Covid-19 vaccines to its citizens. But Chancellor Sebastian Kurz confirmed last weekend that negotiations to buy the Russian Sputnik V vaccine had concluded, even though this shot has not yet been approved by the European Medicines Agency. BlümeI said that Austria had followed the rules and ""tried to get more doses for vaccination, just to be quicker in recovering the economy and giving the people back their freedom."" ""I can't see anything wrong in doing so,"" he said. A few eastern EU nations, such as Hungary, have decided to go beyond the deals negotiated by the European Commission to purchase more vaccines themselves, even if these haven't received medical approval across the bloc. Speaking to CNBC, BlümeI said he is optimistic that in the next two to three months, Austria will have vaccinated all of its adult population who wish to receive a vaccine.",647,3794,15,90
0,US war on Afghanistan cost $2.26 trillion and still rising: Report,https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2021/04/18/649714/US-war-cost-Afghanistan-new-report-Brown-University-,"America’s nearly 20-year military occupation of Afghanistan has cost the country $2.26 trillion, a new study finds, further insisting that the costs will continue to accumulate even after the US total withdrawal from the war-ravaged country later this year, as pledged by Washington.

In its Costs of War report released Friday, Brown University’s Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs has tallied the astounding expense of the longest US war, as the administration of new US President Joe Biden vows to pull out the last few thousand American troops from Afghanistan no later than September 11.

The latest cost analysis of the US war collected estimated congressional appropriations for the military engagement, including operations in both Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan.

According to the report, the greatest single expense -- $933 billion, or 41 percent of the war's total costs -- came in the US Defense Department's Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) spending.

The controversial OCO budget, which was used to pay for the military invasion, was unaffected by budgetary caps imposed on the rest of the department of defense (DoD) and grew significantly over the years.

It further notes, however, that the DoD's base budget also saw its own war-related increases -- apart from the OCO budget and the costs of actually waging war in Afghanistan – underlining that the US military's overall budget grew by an additional $443 billion, making it the third-largest expense of the war effort.

The report also reveals that the war’s second-largest cost was accrued interest expenses -- totaling $530 billion -- from borrowing funds to pay for the military engagement.

Pointing out that the US has also spent $296 billion for the medical treatment of veterans returning from the Afghanistan war, the study insists that such costs are not yet done accumulating, explaining that its analysis did not include the costs of lifetime care for war veterans or future interest payments on the money Washington has borrowed for the war.

According to the study, the US State Department's own OCO war budget cost $59 billion.

The report further estimates that up to 241,000 people have so far died in Afghanistan and Pakistan as a direct result of the war, including 2,442 American troops, six DoD civilians, 3,936 US contractors, and 1,144 allied troops.

The war also took the lives of between 66,000 and 69,000 Afghan national military members and police, as well as another 9,314 Pakistani troops and police forces, it added.

The study also estimates that more than 71,000 civilians -- roughly 47,000 in Afghanistan and 24,000 in Pakistan – were killed, along with over 51,000 opposition fighters in Afghanistan and nearly 33,000 more in Pakistan.

It further pointed out that nearly 136 journalists and media workers, and 549 humanitarian workers, also died in the US-led war.

The US military began the massive invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 in the name of “international war on terrorism,” vowing to overthrow the al-Qaeda-linked Taliban government -- which were heavily backed and funded by close US allies, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan – and root out terrorism across the impoverished country.

However, the country continues to be ravaged by persistent terror attacks.",524,3294,11,66

The directive also leaves open the possibility for the administration to expand the sanctions on Russian sovereign debt.

Additionally, the Biden administration is expelling 10 personnel from the Russian diplomatic mission in Washington, some of whom U.S. officials say are representatives of Russian intelligence services.

Biden sent a letter to Congress announcing the executive order against Russia on Thursday, noting that he had determined that “harmful” activities by the Russian government, including election interference and hacking efforts, “constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.”

Senior administration officials later emphasized to reporters that the actions against Russia should be viewed as “resolute but proportionate,” and that the administration was prepared to take further steps if Russia continued its malicious activities against the United States.

“There are elements of this new EO that give us additional authorities that we are not exercising today,” the senior official said. “We would prefer not to have to deploy these authorities, but the scope and potential to cause meaningful impact should send a clear signal that continued harmful activities, including further election interference, further malicious cyber activities are unacceptable, and we are prepared going forward to impose substantial and lasting costs if this behavior continues.”

The sanctions have been in the works for some time. When Biden took office, he immediately ordered a review of Russia’s involvement in the massive SolarWinds hack, Russian election interference, the poisoning of Alexei Navalny and reported Russian bounties on U.S. service members in Afghanistan.

The SolarWinds hack, first discovered in December, involved Russian hackers exploiting software from IT group SolarWinds to gain access to as many as 18,000 customers, successfully compromising nine federal agencies and 100 private-sector groups.

U.S. intelligence agencies in January said the attack was “likely” carried out by Russian hackers but did not fully attribute it. As part of Thursday’s actions, the Biden administration issued a formal attribution naming Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) as the culprit behind what has become one of the largest cyber espionage attacks in U.S. history.

As part of the response to the malicious Russian hacking, the FBI, the National Security Agency and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued an alert Thursday providing details on vulnerabilities used by the Russian hackers, along with ways to further defend networks.

The alert exposed five vulnerabilities currently being used by the SVR to compromise organizations, with the three agencies urging all cybersecurity groups to “check their networks for indicators of compromise related to all five vulnerabilities” and “implement associated mitigations.”

Additionally, Biden is planning to sign a separate executive order in the upcoming weeks to strengthen federal cybersecurity, and the administration is working with foreign allies to create what a senior administration described as “a framework of responsible state behavior in cyberspace.”

“As the SolarWinds incident has shown, we have to build both domestic and international partnerships and threat intelligence sharing to ensure we can identify, defend against, and mitigate malicious cyber activity from Russia and other adversaries,” the official told reporters.

The administration, in coordination with U.S. allies, already announced sanctions to punish Russia for the Navalny poisoning and his subsequent jailing, with administration officials teasing since February that there would be a response around the SolarWinds hack in “weeks, not months.”

Foreign allies on Thursday expressed support for the Biden’s administration’s actions against Russia, with the United Kingdom separately assessing that the Russian SVR was behind the SolarWinds attack.

The European Union and its member states put out a joint statement to “express their solidarity” with the U.S., and condemn malicious cyber activity.

“The European Union and its Member States remain strongly committed and determined in their solidarity with their international partners in promoting a global, open, stable and secure cyberspace respecting human rights, fundamental freedoms, democratic values and principles and the rule of law, in order for everyone to safely live their lives online, as well as offline,” the EU said.

NATO's governing body also issued a statement expressing support for the U.S. actions.

“Russia continues to demonstrate a sustained pattern of destabilising behaviour,” the NATO statement reads in part. “We stand in solidarity with the United States.”

The already-tense U.S.-Russia relationship has deteriorated further under the Biden administration as the new president has publicly blamed Moscow for its malign behavior, signaling a departure from the Trump era during which Trump often spoke warmly of Russian President Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinNavalny doctor says he could 'die at any moment' Sunday shows preview: Russia, US exchange sanctions; tensions over policing rise; vaccination campaign continues Russia blocks key Biden Cabinet officials from entering in retaliation for sanctions MORE and questioned the U.S. assessment of Russian election interference.

In an interview with ABC News in March, Biden said that Russia would “pay a price” for interfering in the 2020 presidential election and responded in the affirmative when asked if he believed Putin was a killer. Russia reacted angrily to his comments and recalled the Russian ambassador to the U.S.

Biden spoke with Putin by phone on Tuesday and “made clear that the United States will act firmly in defense of its national interests in response to Russia’s actions, such as cyber intrusions and election interference,” according to a White House readout. Biden also raised concerns about Russian military buildup along Ukraine’s border and proposed a summit in the coming months where the U.S. and Russia could discuss a range of issues.

0,"Oxford vaccine supply uncertainty prompts Bangladesh to look at China, Russia for Covid vaccine",https://www.tbsnews.net/coronavirus-chronicle/covid-19-bangladesh/govt-now-looks-china-russia-covid-vaccine-233554,"The government now looks to procure vaccines from China and Russia to meet the ongoing crisis triggered by the non-availability of required doses from India as per the agreement.

A high-level meeting chaired by Prime Minister's Principal Secretary Ahmad Kaikaus might reach a decision on vaccine imports from the two countries on Sunday (Monday), Professor Dr ABM Khurshid Alam, director-general of the Directorate General of Health Services, told The Business Standard.

Besides, the government has decided to invite an international tender to buy vaccines, including Oxford-AstraZeneca developed Covishield and Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which can be stored at temperatures between 2°C and 8°C. Work is underway to finalise various conditions and documents of the proposed tender.

Health ministry officials say Chinese vaccine maker Sinopharm has sent a proposal to supply 60 lakh doses to Bangladesh through a third party. Several companies have also applied to the health ministry as a third party about three months ago, showing interest in importing Russia's vaccine Sputnik V and supplying it to the Bangladesh government.

The government also expects to get some vaccine doses from Covax in the first half of May. Covax is collecting the Oxford vaccine from South Korea after India has imposed a ban on all exports of the Oxford vaccine made by India's Serum Institute.

The government believes that it will be possible to continue the ongoing inoculation drive if Bangladesh gets the required doses from there.

Meanwhile, the director-general of the health directorate said they sent a letter to Beximco Pharmaceuticals and the Serum Institute of India last Saturday to supply vaccine doses to the government as per the deal.

In the letter, the health directorate has asked for a total of 1 crore doses of vaccine, including 50 lakh doses of March and 5o lakh of April, this month. They also urged the two companies to supply one crore doses scheduled for May and June on time.

Covax is expected to supply 6.8 crore doses of vaccine to Bangladesh. In the first shipment, it was supposed to give two crore doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca to Bangladesh towards the end of March. But Covax through a mail informed that it would supply the doses in the first week of May as it was facing a vaccine crisis because of India's ban on the Oxford vaccine export.

Health ministry officials say Covax has continued to try to collect vaccine doses from Serum despite India's export ban. AstraZeneca, the developer of Covishield, sent a notice to Serum on April 8 for not supplying doses to Covax as per the agreement.

Dr ASM Alamgir, principal scientific officer of the IEDCR and member of the Covid-19 Vaccine Preparedness and Deployment Core Committee, told TBS, ""We are also trying to get the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine through Covax to continue the first and the second shot.""

""Covax is collecting Oxford vaccine doses from South Korea alongside Serum. We are trying to get that vaccine. Even if it is available in mid-May, there will be no interruption in our vaccination programme,"" he added.

Alamgir said the government would buy three crore more doses of vaccine through an open tender. Vaccines of the companies that can be stored at temperatures between 2°C and 8°C will be given priority if they take part in the tender.

As per a deal with India's Serum Institute and Beximco, the Bangladesh government was supposed to get 50 lakh doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine every month. Bangladesh has so far received 70 lakh doses in two shipments under the deal.

The first consignment of 50 lakh doses of Oxford vaccine arrived in Dhaka from India on 25 January this year. Later, the second batch of 20 lakh doses from Serum arrived here on 22 February.

Besides, a consignment of 20 lakh doses, gifted by India, reached Dhaka on 21 January, and another consignment of 12 lakh doses, also gifted by India, arrived in Dhaka on 26 March.

Bangladesh has not yet received the remaining 30 lakh doses of February and 50 lakh doses of March and April as per the agreement.

Following India's ban on all exports of the Oxford vaccine made by Serum last month, Salman F Rahman, prime minister's private industry and investment adviser, had told The Business Standard that the Indian government assured that Bangladesh would remain out of the purview of the ban and would get supplies as per demand whenever necessary.

Salman F Rahman could not be contacted on the phone yesterday despite repeated attempts.

However, an official of Beximco said, ""Officials of the Indian High Commission in Dhaka had assured of supplying the vaccine to Bangladesh as per the demand. But they are now not keeping their promise. So, we have nothing to do now.""

India's Serum Institute has agreed to give the vaccine to Bangladesh, but it cannot supply it owing to the ban imposed by the Indian government. The tripartite agreement among the health ministry, Beximco Pharmaceuticals and Serum Institute of India also states that the vaccine cannot be imported without the prior approval of the Indian government, he added.

Bangladesh rolled out mass inoculation on 7 February with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by India's Serum Institute, and more than 57.14 lakh citizens have so far been immunised. On 7 April, the second dose inoculation began. Some 1.36 lakh people have been administered the second shot till now.

Bangladesh now has only 31.19 lakh doses of vaccine out of 1.2 crore doses.

More than one and a half lakh people are now getting vaccinated every day on average. If this continues, the vaccine doses will run out in the next 20-22 days.

Dr ASM Alamgir said, ""We slowed down the first dose immunisation. We will be able to vaccinate people with the second jab till mid-May the way the current per day inoculation rate continues. As the second dose can be given between eight weeks and three months, we are trying to avail vaccine during the break period.""

Meanwhile, India, the world's largest vaccine supplier, has also taken an initiative to import Sputnik V in the wake of the Covid vaccine crisis as the second wave accelerates.

The country, which typically produces 60% of vaccines sold globally, now cannot manufacture the Covid-19 vaccine at full capacity because of the US ban on exporting raw materials critical for vaccine production and the EU's similar restrictions around vaccine exports. So, India is now working to adapt to the materials which are made at home or the neighbouring countries like Singapore,"" but this will take time, reported CNN.",1089,6592,14,95
0,Reparations bill approved out of committee in historic vote,https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/15/reparations-bill-committee-historic-vote-481811,"The bill does not lay out provisions for the shape the reparations would take, whether in the form of direct cash payments or safety net programs. Despite its open-ended design, getting buy-in from enough lawmakers to tee up a floor vote in even one half of Congress is a tall order.

On a Wednesday press call, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer dodged questions about whether he would bring the bill to the floor and tried to put the onus on Biden, suggesting the president create his own reparations commission .

While both parties have been reticent to embrace reparations legislation in the past, the majority of Republicans oppose it. A February POLITICO/Morning Consult poll found that 60 percent of Democrats support the formation of a committee to study reparations while 74 percent of Republicans oppose it. Many on the right argue that today’s lawmakers should not be held responsible for mistakes of the past, like enslavement.

Yet given the ongoing national reckoning on race and systemic racism — now reignited by the trial of Derek Chauvin and a second high-profile police killing in Brooklyn Center, Minn. — reparations advocates say now is a prime opportunity to move reparations legislation forward. It currently has 180 co-sponsors in the House, the most ever. And even with Democrats’ slimmed-down House majority, which includes multiple hesitant moderates, it is in its best position yet to pass that chamber. Doing so would mark a major victory for reparations proponents and racial justice advocates alike.

“I don't think that there's any opposition that can get in the way of passing it out of the House,” said Dreisen Heath, a program advocate at Human Rights Watch. “We're very confident.”

But beyond a House victory, the fate of H.R. 40 — and its chances of ultimately making it to Joe Biden’s desk — is bleak. The White House has maintained that Biden supports the study of reparations and Vice President (then-Senator) Kamala Harris co-sponsored companion legislation in 2019. Still, full passage of the bill would require votes from all 50 Senate Democrats and 10 Republicans, who are almost certain to oppose it.

“The Senate is not a good place to be with this legislation, or any legislation that's progressive and advances the interest of African Americans in particular,” said Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), chair of the House Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, during a Monday press call.

“You’ve got to have ten Republicans right now,” Cohen continued. “And there are not that many of them that are going to quit and not run again, and have a come-to-Jesus moment.”

Rep. Burgess Owens (R-Utah), who is African American, called the legislation “treacherous” and “traitorous” during his testimony on Wednesday, suggesting that the disenfranchisement of Black Americans is the fault of failed Democratic policies rather than the legacy of enslavement or systematic disenfranchisement.

“If you want to pay back the African American community, give us back our history,” Owens said. “We are not a hapless, hopeless race. We’re just like everybody else.”

House Judiciary Republicans echoed these complaints during Wednesday’s committee markup. Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) argued that Democrats should be solely responsible for paying for the commission, saying that their party was most responsible for policies that disproportionately hurt Black Americans.

“I hope that we won’t compound some horrendous sins by punishing great grandchildren of people that did wrong,” Gohmert said.

Explaining the terms of the bill and defining the role of the commission will be crucial to the efforts to get more Republicans on board, Democrats say. The bill’s Senate companion currently has 16 co-sponsors. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas), lead sponsor of H.R. 40, said the bill represents in large part an acknowledgment of past harms done, or a “national apology” to African Americans. She said she expects the commission to identify both the legacy of slavery and specific policy measures that have systematically disenfranchised African Americans.

“We're committed to establishing this H.R 40 as an enabling legislation to address the deep seated racism, and historic and systemic elements of mistreatment of African Americans through the centuries,” Lee said in a Monday press call.

In a statement issued on Thursday, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), sponsor of the Senate bill, lauded the House bill's advancement.

“Our nation has not yet fully acknowledged and grappled with the painful legacy of slavery, white supremacy, and systemic racism that tainted this country’s founding and continues to persist in deep racial disparities and inequalities today, Booker said. ""It’s important that we right the wrongs of our nation’s most discriminatory policies that halted the upward mobility of African-American communities for generations, and we cannot truly move forward without first fully documenting the extent of the harms of the past.""

Some advocates have suggested that the end goal of the legislation — establishment of a commission to study reparations — could be more easily achieved through an executive order .

So far, White House officials have not indicated they're prepared to apply further pressure on Congress. Lee brushed off the suggestion on Monday, underlining her commitment to passing the legislation in both chambers of Congress.

“Our present [White House] leadership also indicated their understanding and support,” Lee said. But we are now on a legislative drive … any further strategies will be certainly addressed as needed.”

At the same time, the concept of reparations is gaining traction in some municipalities across the country. Evanston, Ill., became the first city to craft a reparations policy for its residents in March. The plan allocates $10 million over the next ten years in $25,000 housing assistance payments to qualifying descendants of Black Evanston residents who were victims of housing discrimination. While H.R. 40 does not allocate for payments to African Americans, reparations advocates have cited the Evanston plan as one potential model.

However, some reparations advocates remain skeptical of a model like Evanston’s, which focuses largely on housing and would not advance the ultimate goal of closing the racial wealth gap.

“Certainly there are ongoing issues that residents bring to their city governments to address harms,” said Kirsten Mullen, a writer and researcher whose work has centered on reparations. “But they shouldn't be confused with the goals of a national reparations program for Black American descendants of U.S. slavery.”",1119,7097,9,59
1,Homoerotic Overtones Enliven NRA Meeting,https://local.theonion.com/homoerotic-overtones-enliven-nra-meeting-1819564201,"COEUR D'ALENE, ID—Repression was the order of the day as the National Rifle Association's North Idaho Chapter held its annual convention this weekend.

NRA member Jack Harwich admires a fellow member's piece, stirring potent new feelings within himself.

More than 25,000 dedicated gun lovers from across Northern Idaho flocked to the Coeur d'Alene Convention Center for the two-day event, happily sublimating homosexual impulses amid a carefully maintained facade of platonic camaraderie.

Moscow, ID, resident Richard Hoflinger, 47, a longtime gun-rights activist, exhibited the collection of antique rifles through which he has channeled his culturally unacceptable impulses. ""Guns should be part of any upstanding Christian family,"" Hoflinger said, sticking a long, thick, oily pipe-cleaner 14 inches up an 1886 Remington.

In the next booth, another latent gay man, Duane Erlich, moved his hand slowly up and down a well-polished 1948 Winchester. ""Ain't she a beautiful baby?"" he said, displaying the kind of feminization/infantilization of firearms for which NRA members are renowned.

Erlich then demonstrated the proper loading procedure for his ""baby,"" lovingly inserting a pair of bullets into the dark, snug-fitting tunnels before thrusting the gun's bolt smoothly into the action, cocking it firmly. ""This'll blow a man straight to heaven,"" he said.

The tone of the event was set by chapter president John Henry Unger, whose opening remarks cited the ""wonderful variety of weaponry on display, from little snub-nosed pieces that fit snugly in your pocket to big, meaty shooters with barrels as thick as your arm.""

Unger then fired his father's prize Colt Peacemaker revolver into the air, drawing raucous applause from the crowd, many of whose own fathers had suppressed latent physical attraction for their adolescent sons by channeling forbidden feelings into totemistic firearms.

All over the convention floor, gun manufacturers proudly unveiled new technologies which will allow simmering homoerotic tensions to be expressed with greater nuance than ever before. At the Smith & Wesson booth, company spokesman Darrell Trace displayed a handgun made from a newly developed metal alloy whose ""incredibly hard"" nature, he explained, gives it no recoil after use, providing its user with ""a far greater sense of control over his piece.""

""It's a very comfortable gun, very soft in the hands,"" Trace added, noting that Smith & Wesson had designed the gun to appeal to ""shooters tired of coming home from the firing range with sore, worn-out wrists.""

But even as conventioneers reveled in a two-day orgy of firearm-to-phallus transference, a dark cloud hung over the event. The NRA has declined in power over the last decade, and its once-potent lobbyists have come out on the small end of key legislative battles like the Brady Bill, causing many members to bring their lifelong subconscious fears of castration to the fore.

0,Human cells grown in monkey embryos reignite ethics debate,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/apr/15/human-cells-grown-monkey-embryos-reignite-ethics-debate,"Monkey embryos containing human cells have been produced in a laboratory, a study has confirmed, spurring fresh debate into the ethics of such experiments.

The embryos are known as chimeras, organisms whose cells come from two or more “individuals”, and in this case, different species: a long-tailed macaque and a human.

In recent years researchers have produced pig embryos and sheep embryos that contain human cells – research they say is important as it could one day allow them to grow human organs inside other animals, increasing the number of organs available for transplant.

Now scientists have confirmed they have produced macaque embryos that contain human cells, revealing the cells could survive and even multiply.

In addition, the researchers, led by Prof Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte from the Salk Institute in the US, said the results offer new insight into communications pathways between cells of different species: work that could help them with their efforts to make chimeras with species that are less closely related to our own.

“These results may help to better understand early human development and primate evolution and develop effective strategies to improve human chimerism in evolutionarily distant species,” the authors wrote.

The study confirms rumours reported in the Spanish newspaper El País in 2019 that a team of researchers led by Belmonte had produced monkey-human chimeras. The word chimera comes from a beast in Greek mythology that was said to be part lion, part goat and part snake.

The study, published in the journal Cell, reveals how the scientists took specific human foetal cells called fibroblasts and reprogrammed them to become stem cells. These were then introduced into 132 embryos of long-tailed macaques, six days after fertilisation.

“Twenty-five human cells were injected and on average we observed around 4% of human cells in the monkey epiblast,” said Dr Jun Wu, a co-author of the research now at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.

The embryos were allowed to develop in petri dishes and were terminated 19 days after the stem cells were injected. In order to check whether the embryos contained human cells, the team engineered the human stem cells to produce a fluorescent protein.

Among other findings, the results reveal all 132 embryos contained human cells on day seven after fertilisation, although as they developed, the proportion containing human cells fell over time.

“We demonstrated that the human stem cells survived and generated additional cells, as would happen normally as primate embryos develop and form the layers of cells that eventually lead to all of an animal’s organs,” Belmonte said.

The team also reported that they found some differences in cell-cell interactions between human and monkey cells within chimeric embryos, compared with embryos of the monkeys without human cells.

Wu said they hoped the research would help develop “transplantable human tissues and organs in pigs to help overcome the shortages of donor organs worldwide”.

Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, a developmental biologist from the Francis Crick Institute in London, said at the time of the El País report he was not concerned about the ethics of the experiment, noting the team had only produced a ball of cells. But he noted conundrums could arise in the future should the embryos be allowed to develop further.

While not the first attempt at making human-monkey chimeras – another group reported such experiments last year – the new study has reignited such concerns. Prof Julian Savulescu, the director of the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics and co-director of the Wellcome Centre for Ethics and Humanities at the University of Oxford, said the research had opened a Pandora’s box to human-nonhuman chimeras.

“These embryos were destroyed at 20 days of development but it is only a matter of time before human-nonhuman chimeras are successfully developed, perhaps as a source of organs for humans,” he said, adding that a key ethical question is over the moral status of such creatures.

“Before any experiments are performed on live-born chimeras, or their organs extracted, it is essential that their mental capacities and lives are properly assessed. What looks like a nonhuman animal may mentally be close to a human,” he said. “We will need new ways to understand animals, their mental lives and relationships before they are used for human benefit.”

Others raised concerns about the quality of the study. Dr Alfonso Martinez Arias, an affiliated lecturer in the department of genetics at the University of Cambridge, said: “I do not think that the conclusions are backed up by solid data. The results, in so far as they can be interpreted, show that these chimeras do not work and that all experimental animals are very sick.

“Importantly, there are many systems based on human embryonic stem cells to study human development that are ethically acceptable and in the end, we shall use this rather than chimeras of the kind suggested here.”",810,5048,9,58

Media reports indicated the rocket landed in Israeli territory, but in an uninhabited area. There were no reports of injuries or damage.

The rocket triggered warning sirens in the southern Gaza border communities of Holit and Sde Avraham, hours after the start of Shabbat.

In response, Israeli aircraft hit a series of Hamas targets in Gaza, the IDF said. It also issued a video of some of the strikes.

Among the targets bombed included a Hamas training camp, an anti-aircraft position that was being constructed and a factory producing cement to be used in constructing attack tunnels.

The army said it holds Hamas responsible for all violence emanating from the Strip.

The launch came a day after a rocket fired by Gaza-based terrorists struck a field northeast of the Strip. In response, IDF aircraft struck targets linked to the Hamas terror group, which rules Gaza.

The targets included an armaments production facility, a tunnel for smuggling weaponry and a Hamas military post, according to the IDF.

The attacks came during a general lull in violence from the Gaza Strip in recent months, amid a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and as Gaza grapples with the coronavirus pandemic.

0,Doctors home in on cause of blood clots potentially linked with Covid-19 vaccines,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/16/health/blood-clots-vaccine-possible-cause/index.html,"(CNN) Doctors say they are homing in on the cause of blood clots that may be linked with certain coronavirus vaccines, and add their findings have important implications for how to treat the condition, regardless of whether vaccines cause it.

Even though the link is not yet firm, they're calling the condition vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia or VITT. It's characterized by unusual blood clotting combined with a low number of blood-clotting cells called platelets. Patients suffer from dangerous clots and, sometimes, hemorrhaging at the same time.

It's been linked most firmly with the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, which is in wide use in Europe and the UK.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration are checking to see if Johnson & Johnson's Janssen vaccine also might cause the blood clots. Both AstraZeneca's vaccine and the J&J vaccine use common cold viruses called adenoviruses as a carrier and some experts suspect the body's response to those viral vectors might underlie the reaction. AstraZeneca's vaccine is not authorized in the US.

The FDA and CDC have asked for a pause in giving out the J&J vaccine while they investigate.

A team led by Dr. Marie Scully, a hematologist at University College London Hospitals, studied 22 patients who developed the syndrome after receiving AstraZeneca's vaccine, and found they had an unusual antibody response. These so-called anti-PF4 antibodies had only been seen before as a rare reaction to the use of the common blood thinner heparin.

The findings support a theory that an immune reaction might underlie the rare blood clots, but the findings don't yet explain it, Scully and colleagues r eported in the New England Journal of Medicine Friday. What may be going on is a reaction by the immune system with platelets to cause uncontrolled clotting.

If vaccines cause it, it's still very rare and unusual, they wrote. It might not even be happening any more often in recently vaccinated people than among the population in general.

""The risk of thrombocytopenia and the risk of venous thromboembolism after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 do not appear to be higher than the background risks in the general population, a finding consistent with the rare and sporadic nature of this syndrome,"" they wrote.

""The events reported in this study appear to be rare, and until further analysis is performed, it is difficult to predict who may be affected. The symptoms developed more than five days after the first vaccine dose,"" they added.

""In all cases reported to date, this syndrome of thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) and venous thrombosis (blood clot) appears to be triggered by receipt of the first dose of the (AstraZeneca) ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Although there have been a few reports of patients with symptoms consistent with this clinical syndrome after the receipt of other vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, none have yet been confirmed to fulfill the diagnostic criteria,"" they added.

But if vaccination can cause the condition, it would be important to recognize that and treat it appropriately -- because the usual treatment for blood clots is not recommended for VITT.

Patients should be given anti-clotting drugs, but not heparin, and infusions of a blood product called intravenous immunoglobulin may replace the depleted platelets.

It's also not clear who's at highest risk, Dr. Douglas Cines of the University of Pennsylvania and Dr. James Bussel of Weill Cornell Medicine wrote in a commentary. ""Most of the patients included in these reports were women younger than 50 years of age, some of whom were receiving estrogen-replacement therapy or oral contraceptives. A remarkably high percentage of the patients had thromboses at unusual sites,"" they wrote.

Some European countries have restricted who should get AstraZeneca's vaccine. For example. Belgium limits its use in people under age 55. Other countries have paused its use. CDC's vaccine advisers have been asked to consider whether similar restrictions might be appropriate for Johnson & Johnson's vaccine, although only a handful of cases have been reported in the US.

While blood clots in the brain have received the most attention, patients have also had clots in other large veins and arteries.

These blood clots in the brain -- called cerebral venous sinus thromboses or CVST -- are dramatic on their own, but the clots may be forming elsewhere, also.

Doctors are being advised to run tests if people develop blood clots after having been vaccinated recently against coronavirus, and to not use heparin to treat the clots until VITT has been ruled out.

The condition is very similar to a known development called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, the American Society of Hematology says new guidance released earlier this week . It's also calling the condition VITT.

ASH published guidance saying normal post-vaccination malaise, headache and fever are not of concern.

""Patients with severe, recurrent, or persistent symptoms, particularly intense headache, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, vision changes, shortness of breath, and/or leg pain and swelling, either persisting or beginning four to 20 days following vaccination should be evaluated urgently by a medical provider and consideration given to underlying VITT,"" ASH says in the new guidance.

""While current information links VITT to AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, patients with suggestive timing and symptoms following any COVID-19 vaccine should be evaluated for VITT.""

CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has scheduled a meeting for April 23 to take up the question again after declining to make a decision Wednesday. One committee member told CNN more data is needed.

""We need to know what the size of the problem is,"" said Dr. Kevin Ault, professor and division director with the University of Kansas Medical Center. ""So we're going to shake the trees in the databases that the CDC has and we also need to know what the denominator is -- is it just young women or the whole population that's been vaccinated?""

CDC wants to know if there is anything specific that might put people at higher risk of developing blood clots after vaccination.

""There are still a fair number of people in the United States who have been vaccinated in the last two weeks,"" Ault said. ""We've seen these reactions within two weeks, so it doesn't sound like a very long time, but we'll have a fair amount of data in just those nine or ten days.""

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

In a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine, scientists at Janssen, the vaccine arm of Johnson & Johnson, say there isn't enough evidence to show the company's Covid-19 vaccine causes the blood clots and they are ""working closely with experts and regulators to assess the data, and we support the open communication of this information to health care professionals and the public.""

""At this time,"" they write, ""evidence is insufficient to establish a causal relationship between these events and the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine.""

Vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech use a different technology that sends genetic material into the body wrapped in lipids, and they have not been linked with blood clots.",1186,7391,13,81

0,France tells citizens to leave Pakistan ‘due to serious threats’,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/15/france-tells-citizens-to-leave-pakistan-due-to-serious-threats,"Amid violent protests led by an anti-France far-right party, Paris calls on its citizens and French companies to leave temporarily.

Islamabad, Pakistan – The French embassy in Pakistan has advised all French nationals and companies to temporarily leave the country, after violent protests by a far-right party that has accused French President Emmanuel Macron of committing “blasphemy”.

A French embassy official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the development to Al Jazeera on Thursday.

“I confirm that, due to the situation in Pakistan, we have advised the French citizens and companies to leave the country temporarily,” the official said.

A second French official said that while the embassy in the Pakistani capital Islamabad would remain open, some staff would also be leaving the country.

The AFP news agency, based in France, quoted an email sent to French citizens in Pakistan advising them to leave.

“Due to the serious threats to French interests in Pakistan, French nationals and French companies are advised to temporarily leave the country,” the embassy said in the email, AFP reported.

“The departures will be carried out by existing commercial airlines.”

Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was aware of the French advice “which appears to be based on their own assessment of the situation”.

“For its part, the government is taking enhanced measures for the maintenance of law and order and preventing any damage to life and property,” said Zahid Hafeez Chaudhri, ministry spokesperson.

Anti-France sentiment has been at the centre of the far-right Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) party’s messaging since it held protests last November against comments by Macron that were deemed by many, including Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan, to be “encouraging Islamophobia”.

Those protests were quelled after the TLP reached an agreement with the Pakistani government to put the question of expelling the French ambassador, boycotting all French goods and taking other steps before Parliament.

This week, however, violent protests broke out across the country when the government arrested TLP chief Saad Rizvi in what appeared to be a preemptive move ahead of the expiry of a TLP-issued April 20 deadline for the expulsion of the French envoy.

On Thursday, Pakistan’s government formally banned TLP under anti-terrorism laws, Sheikh Rasheed, the interior minister, told reporters in Islamabad.

Rasheed said the government would also move a legal petition to have TLP officially delisted as a political party by the Election Commission, effectively unseating its two provincial lawmakers in the southern province of Sindh.

TLP emerged as the fourth largest single party in the aggregated national popular vote for the lower house of parliament in the general election in 2018, although its candidates were all beaten. Two TLP members won provincial seats in Sindh in that election.

At least two policemen were killed and hundreds of policemen and protesters were wounded in clashes at the nationwide demonstrations.

Large rallies were held in Karachi, Pakistan’s largest city, the eastern city of Lahore, near the capital Islamabad, and elsewhere.

Major intercity highways and roads were closed for much of Monday and Tuesday as the protests and clashes continued. Police fired water cannon, tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the protesters in some areas.

Furore over cartoons

The November protests followed Macron’s support for the right to republish cartoons depicting Prophet Muhammad, considered “blasphemous” by many Muslims.

The caricatures in question are also viewed by many as Islamophobic, as they often link the faith to “terrorism”.

Blasphemy is a sensitive subject in Pakistan, where insulting Islam’s prophet, holy book or other religious personages are crimes that can carry the death penalty.

Increasingly, blasphemy allegations have led to violence by mobs or targeted attacks, with at least 78 people killed in such violence since 1990, according to an Al Jazeera tally.

In the latest such incident, Taqi Shah, a religious scholar belonging to the minority Shia Muslim sect was axed to death in the town of Jhang in March after being accused of committing “blasphemy”.

For too long, Americans have been divided by medians, stayed in their bubbles of turnpikes or bus lanes or private driveways, and it is time for that to end. Whether you’re on a cul-de-sac, a frontage road, a lane, a restricted byway, or Interstate 90, you should be able to drive to the middle of the country, enter the 100-mile roundabout I have planned, and merge onto any other avenue, trunk road, or corniche that this country has to offer. Once we all travel across the country and meet up in the intersection’s rest stop to get gas and pick out something from one of the vending machines, I think we’ll realize that we’re not so different after all.” At press time, the senators were voting unanimously to confirm Buttigieg after he outlined his plans to expand the big, beautiful American intersection to include every railroad track, airstrip, and shipping lane in the country.

""If possible, (the women should) postpone the pregnancy a bit to a better time so that (they) can have a more peaceful pregnancy,"" Secretary of Primary Health Care of the Brazilian health ministry Raphael Camara said Friday. ""We cannot say this to those who are 42, 43 years old, of course, but for a young woman who can, the best thing is to wait for a little,"" he said during a press conference.

Brazil is second only to the US in terms of Covid-19 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University, with 368,749 deaths and more than 13.8 million cases. Cities across the country have been hit hard by a recent surge in Covid-19 cases and deaths, fueled in part by new variants believed to be extra contagious and some Brazilians' disregard for social distancing precautions.

The country could be headed for even worse times thanks to a combination of political chaos and inaction, a team of public health experts warned this week.

""In Brazil, the federal response has been a dangerous combination of inaction and wrongdoing, including the promotion of chloroquine as treatment despite a lack of evidence,"" a team led by Marcia Castro of the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, experts at the University of São Paulo and elsewhere wrote in their report, published in the journal Science.

Researchers argued that ""prompt and equitable"" responses from the federal government could have helped contain the outbreak and protect the most vulnerable -- but leaders have failed, and are still failing, to do so.

In the city of Manaus, a spike in severe cases led to hospital systems collapsing, with a shortage of oxygen for patients.

""Without immediate action, this could be a preview of what is yet to happen in other localities in Brazil,"" the team warned. Unless the government took immediate action, conducted epidemiological and genomic surveillance measures, and stepped up vaccinations, the spread of variants will likely lead to ""unimaginable loss of lives.""

Camara said Friday that the ministry is working on studies on the issue of pregnancy and variants.

""We do not have a national or international study, but the clinical view of experts shows that the new variant has a more aggressive action on pregnant women,"" he said. ""Before, [severity] was linked to the end of the pregnancy, but now (they) see a more serious evolution in the second trimester and even in the first trimester,"" he added.

Meanwhile, the UK's vaccine advisers said pregnant women ""of any age"" in the country can be offered either the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna Covid-19 vaccines.

""Although clinical trials on the use of COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy are not advanced, the available data do not indicate any harm to pregnancy,"" Friday's updated guidance said. ""JCVI [The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation] has therefore advised that women who are pregnant should be offered vaccination at the same time as non-pregnant women, based on their age and clinical risk group.""

The guidance further said that ""there is now extensive post-marketing experience of the use of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines in the USA with no safety signals so far. These vaccines are therefore the preferred vaccines to offer to pregnant women.""

""Pregnant women who commenced vaccination with AstraZeneca, however, are advised to complete with the same vaccine.""

0,Uefa furious at clubs' breakaway plan,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/56794673,"Last updated on .From the section European Football

Liverpool and Chelsea are understood to be part of the group that have signed up to a breakaway league

Uefa, the Premier League and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson have condemned 12 major European clubs, including the 'big six' from England, signing up to a breakaway European Super League.

Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham are part of the group.

La Liga's Atletico Madrid, Barcelona and Real Madrid and Serie A's AC Milan, Inter Milan and Juventus are involved.

Uefa said it will use ""all measures"" possible to stop the ""cynical project"".

Senior figures at European football's governing body are furious about the proposals.

Dion Dublin & Danny Murphy discuss the plans for a European Super League

Johnson said the plans would be ""very damaging for football"" and that the UK government supports the sport's authorities ""in taking action"".

He added: ""The clubs involved must answer to their fans and the wider footballing community before taking any further steps.""

The European Clubs' Association (ECA), which represents Europe's clubs, held an emergency meeting on Sunday in the wake of the reports.

BBC Sport understands none of the clubs mentioned in the Super League reports responded to a request to attend the meeting.

The meeting was chaired by Ajax chief executive Edwin van der Sar. Bayern Munich and Paris St-Germain were among the clubs who were present.

In a statement the ECA said it would be ""strongly opposed"" to a ""closed super league model"".

It has pushed plans for a 36-team Champions League, which Uefa had hoped would head off the formation of a Super League. The Champions League reforms are set to be confirmed on Monday.

BBC Sport was told last week of plans for some sort of confirmation about a European Super League.

Uefa released a joint statement, together with England's Football Association, the Premier League, the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), La Liga, and the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) as well as Serie A, on Sunday.

They said they will ""remain united"" in trying to stop the breakaway, using both judicial and sporting measures if required.

They also reiterated Fifa's stance that players taking part in the Super League would be banned from all other competitions at domestic, European or world level and could be prevented from representing their national teams.

In a separate statement, the Premier League said it condemned the proposal as it ""attacks the principles of open competition and sporting merit which are at the heart"" of domestic and European football.

Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said in a statement the government is ""concerned this plan could create a closed shop at the very top of our national game"".

He added: ""We have a football pyramid where funds from the globally successful Premier League flow down the leagues and into local communities.

A European Super League: The future of football?

""I would be bitterly disappointed to see any action that destroys that.""

Labour leader Keir Starmer said the clubs involved should ""rethink immediately"" or ""face the consequences of their actions"".

""This proposal risks shutting the door on fans for good, reducing them to mere spectators and consumers,"" he said.

Juventus owner Andrea Agnelli, Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and AC Milan chief executive Ivan Gazidis would all have had a significant input into the Champions League discussions on Friday.

However, those clubs are among those to have broken ranks, to the fury of Uefa, whose president Aleksander Ceferin wanted to stave off a Super League threat.

The Premier League said a European Super League would ""destroy"" the dream of fans that ""their team may climb to the top and play against the best"".

It added such a league would ""undermine the appeal of the whole game"" and that they would work with the FA, the English Football League, Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), League Managers Association (LMA) and fans to ""defend the integrity and future prospects of English football"".

Juventus and AC Milan have signed up to the breakaway league plans

The FA said it will ""not provide permission to any competition that would be damaging to English football"" and will ""take any legal and/or regulatory action necessary"" to stop it.

Bundesliga sides are opposed to the plans because the German model means commercial investors cannot have more than a 49% stake in clubs, so fans hold a majority of their own voting rights.

French Ligue 1 side Paris St-Germain are not part of the group either.

Uefa said it thanked ""those clubs in other countries, especially the French and German clubs, who have refused to sign up"" to the breakaway league.

""We call on all lovers of football, supporters and politicians, to join us in fighting against such a project if it were to be announced,"" it added.

""This persistent self-interest of a few has been going on for too long. Enough is enough.""

Quite when the European Super League would start is unclear.

However, world governing body Fifa has already said it would not recognise such a competition and any players involved in it would be denied the chance to play at a World Cup.

Serie A has called an emergency board meeting to discuss the matter.

The Football Supporters' Association said it is ""totally opposed"" to the plans, which it said were ""motivated by nothing but cynical greed"".

It added: ""This competition is being created behind our backs by billionaire club owners who have zero regard for the game's traditions and continue to treat football as their personal fiefdom.""

The PFA said it had ""substantial concerns"" about the proposal, adding it would ""detract from the strength and joy of domestic football and diminish the game for the vast majority of fans across the continent"".

France's President Emmanuel Macron said he ""welcomes the position of French clubs to refuse to participate"" in a European Super League ""that threatens the principle of solidarity and sporting merit"".

A statement from the French presidency added: ""The French state will support all the steps taken by the LFP [France's professional leagues governing body], FFF [France's football association], Uefa and Fifa to protect the integrity of federal competitions, whether national or European.""

It has been agreed the new-look Champions League will involve an initial phase where every club plays 10 matches each rather than the current group phase.

In addition there would be play-offs, followed by a knockout phase.

The most controversial aspect of the proposals surround the allocation of the four additional places, with two being reserved for the clubs ranked highest in Uefa's co-efficient table who fail to qualify for the Champions League through their domestic competition, but do secure some kind of European football.

At the moment, Liverpool and Chelsea would be the clubs who benefited from that system if it was in place this season.

'An absolute disgrace'

Former Manchester United captain Gary Neville said he is ""absolutely disgusted"" by the plans.

""I'm a Manchester United fan and have been for 40 years,"" Neville, who also co-owns League Two club Salford City, told Sky Sports. ""It's an absolute disgrace.

""Honestly, we have to wrestle back the power in this country from the clubs at the top of this league and that includes my club.""

The former England defender said the six English clubs involved should be docked points and fined.

""It's pure greed,"" Neville said. ""They're [the club's owners] imposters.

""They're nothing to do with football in this country. There's 100-odd years of history in this country of fans who have lived and loved these clubs.

""We're in the middle of a pandemic and an economic crisis. Football clubs in the [semi-professional] National League are going bust, furloughing players and these lot are having Zoom calls about breaking away.

""Dock them all points tomorrow. Put them at the bottom of the league and take the money off them. Seriously. You have to stamp on this.""",1319,8110,6,37
0,Canadian province officially moves to decriminalize personal drug possession,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2021MMHA0017-000706,"As British Columbia marks five years since declaring the overdose crisis a public health emergency, its unprecedented toll continues to affect people in every part of the province.

Taking action that is aligned with calls from police chiefs and public health officials, the Province is moving forward with vital measures to combat stigma and turn the tide on this crisis.

To address stigma, B.C. will officially request a federal exemption from Health Canada to decriminalize personal possession of drugs in the province to remove the shame that often prevents people from reaching out for life-saving help.

“Stigma drives people to hide their drug use, avoid health care and use alone,” said Sheila Malcolmson, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “Through provincewide decriminalization, we can reduce the fear and shame that keep people silent about their drug use, and support people to reach out for help, life-saving supports and treatment.”

Officials with the Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions and Health Canada have been working on an agreement that outlines how the Province of B.C. will work with Health Canada to apply for a provincewide exemption to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, which governs simple drug possession.

The overdose crisis has impacted every community in B.C., and a provincewide exemption must consider the circumstances unique to urban, rural and remote communities. Key issues for consideration are defining simple possession, determining allowable drug amounts and ensuring the readiness of law enforcement, health and social services to support decriminalization.

Consultation with Indigenous partners, peers, law enforcement, municipalities and public health officials is being planned.

Decriminalization is one additional tool in B.C.’s accelerated overdose response plan that also includes harm reduction, prevention, treatment and recovery, while building a system of mental health and substance use care.

As a signal of its commitment to the overdose response and what is to come in B.C.’s Budget 2021 and beyond, the Province is also boosting funds to secure recently expanded overdose prevention services for people at high risk of overdose provincewide.

A new $45-million investment over the next three years will extend and enhance the funding announced in August 2020 to support those services to save more lives.



“The COVID-19 pandemic is having devastating effects on people who use drugs – illicit substances are more toxic and people are struggling with increased isolation,” Malcolmson said. “Today, our government is committing to sustain and enhance services in every health authority to prevent overdose deaths and connect people to supports. There’s more to come as we continue building the comprehensive system of mental health and addictions care that British Columbians deserve.”

This investment will support people who use drugs by enabling health authorities to continue scaling up their regional overdose responses through new and expanded overdose prevention services, including inhalation sites to meet the growing need for this mode of consumption. Health authorities are hiring new registered nurses who can prescribe addictions treatment medications, in addition to social workers and peer support workers for new and existing interdisciplinary outreach teams.

The Province will continue to allocate funds to health authorities, which have the operational responsibility for planning and delivering services to meet the unique needs of the communities they serve.

There is much more to do to stem the tide of the overdose crisis; however, many people are getting the help they need now. Last year, nearly 3,000 overdoses were survived at overdose prevention services, with zero deaths recorded.

Expanding overdose prevention services and connecting people to treatment and supports is an integral part of A Pathway to Hope, B.C.’s roadmap for making mental health and addictions care better for people in British Columbia.

The funding is part of B.C.’s Budget 2021, which will work to continue to keep people safe and healthy now, while making investments in the critical services people rely on to support a strong recovery that includes all British Columbians.

Quick Facts:

Since 2018, more than 6,000 deaths have been averted because of the life-saving interventions government has implemented, such as expanded access to overdose prevention services including wide availability to naloxone.

Currently, more than 23,000 people are receiving some form of opioid agonist treatment in B.C. – more than at any other time.

To date, 82 registered nurses and registered psychiatric nurses have enrolled to complete their training to prescribe medications for opioid use disorder.

According to the BC Coroners Service, using drugs by inhalation has become the most common mode of consumption implicated in illicit drug toxicity deaths in B.C.

The Province is expanding access to addiction treatment and recovery services, including $36 million to double youth treatment beds and $13.5 million to increase adult beds throughout B.C. – with more to come.

0,Navalny camp plans protests across Russia on 21 April as health fears worsen,https://www.livemint.com/news/world/navalny-camp-plans-protests-across-russia-on-21-april-as-health-fears-worsen-11618748511342.html,"Jailed Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny’s condition has worsened sharply after a 2 1/2 week-long hunger strike, prompting supporters to say he could die in days and announce a nationwide protest.

“Alexey is dying now. Given his condition, it’s a matter of days,"" Navalny’s spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh said on Facebook. Navalny’s supporters called for demonstrations across Russia on April 21 in a blog post.

Anastasia Vasilieva, who heads the Alliance of Doctors union that is backed by Navalny and who is also his doctor, posted a copy of his blood-test results showing what she said were “critical"" levels of potassium. “This signifies kidney failure, which can lead at any time to a severe disruption to his heartbeat"" including the possibility of heart failure, she said on Twitter.

U.S. President Joe Biden was asked about Navalny’s condition on Saturday. “It’s totally, totally unfair,"" Biden told reporters in brief remarks. Navalny’s fate is in Putin’s hands, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Sunday.

Navalny, 44, has been held since March 11 at the notorious IK-2 prison camp about 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Moscow. President Vladimir Putin’s most outspoken critic was imprisoned for breaking parole rules while he was recovering in Germany from a near-fatal chemical poisoning in Siberia that he and Western governments blamed on the Kremlin. Russian authorities deny involvement.

After complaining of acute back and leg pain, Navalny began a hunger strike on March 31 to demand specialist care from doctors outside the prison system. In a post on his Instagram account Friday, Navalny’s allies reported that a prison official had warned him that a blood test indicated a “serious deterioration"" in his health and that he would be force-fed if he didn’t end the protest.

The Federal Penitentiary Service didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Officials have said previously that Navalny has received all necessary medical attention.

Biden pressed Putin in a phone call on Tuesday about the poisoning of the opposition leader, which U.S. intelligence has publicly blamed on Russia’s Federal Security Service. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron also quizzed Putin about Navalny in a March 30 phone call.

Dozens of public figures including five Nobel Literature Prize winners urged Putin in an open letter Friday to ensure that Navalny immediately receives medical treatment. So far, Russia has brushed aside all Western criticism of the case and Kremlin officials refuse even to mention Navalny by name.

Even as his condition deteriorates, Russian prosecutors stepped up a crackdown Friday by asking a Moscow court to declare Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation and his Moscow campaign headquarters to be extremist organizations. The opposition group warned that the designation could subject all of its staff and volunteers to criminal prosecution and imprisonment.

More than 457,000 people have pledged anonymously to take part in new demonstrations calling for his release, according to a tally on Navalny’s website. Organizers abandoned their goal of collecting half a million signatures to schedule a new protest, saying they could no longer wait.

The rally comes on the same day as Putin’s annual state-of-the-nation address to the Federal Assembly.

“Alexey Navalny’s life and the fate of Russia depend on how many people turn out on the streets this Wednesday,"" Navalny supporters wrote on his blog on Sunday. “We need three days to prepare for the rally so that everyone hears about it.""

(Updates with plans to hold protest before reaching goal of 500,000 signatures starting in first paragraph, French foreign minister in fourth paragraph.)

0,Ontario Canada - Police have been given sweeping powers as COVID crisis spirals out of control. New measures introduced to enforce stay-at-home orders as hospitals ‘bursting at the seams’.,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/16/ontario-coronavirus-police-powers-covid-canada,"Ontario has announced sweeping new police powers to enforce an extended stay-at-home order, in the latest sign that officials in Canada’s most populous province have lost control of the rapidly spreading coronavirus.

With a record number of new cases, there is growing worry among experts that the already-strained healthcare system is being further pushed to the brink.

“We’re losing the battle between the variants and vaccines,’’ Ontario’s premier, Doug Ford, said on Friday as he announced the new measures. “We’re on our heels. If we dig in, remain steadfast, we can turn this around.”

Police in Ontario will now have the power to stop drivers or pedestrians and ask for their address and reason for being out. Residents could face fines of up to $C750 (US$600) for refusing to comply. Checkpoints will be established on provincial borders with Manitoba and Quebec to stop non-essential travel – but not on the frontier with the US.

The measures prompted an immediate and furious backlash.

“Blanket powers for police to stop vehicles like this bends our constitutional freedoms too far, and will cause a rash of racial profiling,” Michael Bryant of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association said in a statement.

Ford also announced restrictions on playgrounds, camping and outdoor sports.

And although most of the current cases involve frontline and essential workers, the premier made no mention of sick pay – a policy health experts say would help slow the spread of the virus.

The restrictions came as new modeling forecast more than 15,000 new cases a day in Ontario by June if current growth continues – even with vaccinations. If measures are weakened prematurely, the province could see more than 30,000 a day. Ontario announced a record 4,812 new cases on Friday.

The new modeling also projects that as many as 1,800 residents could be in the intensive care unit by the end of May.

“[Our hospitals] are bursting at the seams, we are setting up field hospitals,” Adalsteinn Brown, co-chair of the province’s science table, told reporters. “Our children’s hospitals are admitting adults. This has never happened in Ontario before. It’s never happened in Canada before.”

Ontario estimates it will need more than 4,000 additional nurses in the coming months and has asked all provinces and territories for 620 nurses – especially those with intensive care experience – as soon as possible.

Brown said that while growth over the next two weeks is effectively “baked in”, strong measures, including extending the stay-at-home order, and a ramp-up of vaccinations could help limit how much worse the third wave becomes.",427,2636,29,188

1,Reaganomics Finally Trickles Down To Area Man,https://local.theonion.com/reaganomics-finally-trickles-down-to-area-man-1819569412,"HAZELWOOD, MO—Twenty-six years after Ronald Reagan first set his controversial fiscal policies into motion, the deceased president's massive tax cuts for the ultrarich at last trickled all the way down to deliver their bounty, in the form of a $10 bonus, to Hazelwood, MO car-wash attendant Frank Kellener.

The late President Ronald Reagan clearly had people like present-day car wash attendant Frank Kellener in mind when articulating his ""trickle-down"" economic theory in the early 1980s.

""Back when Reagan was in charge, I didn't think much of him,"" Kellener, 57, said, holding up two five-dollar bills nearly three decades in the making. ""But who would have thought that in 2007 I'd have this extra $10 in my pocket? He may not have lived to see it, but I'm sure President Reagan is up in heaven smiling down on me right now.""

Leading economists say Kellener's unexpected windfall provides the first irrefutable proof of the effectiveness of Reagan's so-called supply-side economics, and shows that the former president had ""incredible, far-reaching foresight.""

""When the tax burden on the upper income brackets is lifted, the rich and not-rich alike all benefit,"" said Arthur Laffer, who was a former member of Reagan's Economic Policy Advisory Board. ""Eventually.""

Frank Kellener

The $10 began its long journey into Kellener's wallet in 1983, when a beefed-up national defense budget of $210 billion enabled the military to purchase advanced warhead-delivery systems from aerospace manufacturer Lockheed. Buoyed by a multimillion-dollar bonus, then-CEO Martin Lawler bought a house on a 5,000-acre plot in Montana. When a forest fire destroyed his home in 1986, Lawler took the federal relief check and invested it in a savings and loan run by a Virginia man named Michael Webber. After Webber's firm collapsed in 1989, and he was indicted on fraud and conspiracy charges, he retained the services of high- powered law firm Rabin & Levy for his defense. After six years and $7 million in legal fees, Webber received only a $250,000 fine, and the defense team went out to celebrate at a Washington, D.C.-area restaurant called Di Forenza. During dinner, lawyer Peter Smith overheard several investment bankers at an adjoining table discussing a hot Internet start-up that was about to go public. Smith took a portion of his earnings from the Webber case and bought several hundred shares in Gadgets.com, quadrupling his investment before selling them four months later. Gadgets.com's two founders used the sudden influx of investment capital to outfit their office with modern Danish furniture, in a sale brokered by the New York gallery Modern Now! in 1998. After the ensuing dot-com bust, Modern Now! was forced out of business, and Sotheby's auction house was put in charge of liquidating its inventory. The commission from that auction enabled auctioneer Mary Schafer to retire to the Ozark region of Missouri in 2006. Last month, while passing through Hazelwood, she took her Audi to Marlin Car Wash, where Kellener was one of the employees who tended to her car. She was so satisfied with the job that she left a $50 tip, which the manager divided among the people working that day.

""This money didn't just affect one life,"" Laffer said. ""It affected five.""

Prior to joining Marlin Car Wash in 2005, Kellener worked for nearly two decades at a local Ford assembly plant that is now defunct. Before that, he was employed by the FAA as an air traffic controller until his union went on strike and Reagan fired him, along with nearly 13,000 others. This is the largest tip he has received in his professional life.

""I thought Reaganomics was nothing more than a mirage that allowed President Reagan to reward his wealthy support base,"" Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-MA) said. ""But two generations later I am seeing Reaganomics in action, and I like what I see. It just took a little longer than I thought it was supposed to.""

The tip has not gone unnoticed by the economic team in the current administration.

""Had Mr. Kellener received that money in 1981, like the Democrats wanted, it would only be worth $4.24 today because of inflation,"" Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. said during an official announcement of the economic policy's success at a press conference Monday. ""Instead, Kellener has a solid $10 to spend right here and now. The system works, and our current president intends to keep making it work.""

Kellener, who has cared for his schizophrenic sister ever since her federally funded mental institution was closed in 1984, said that he plans to donate the full $10 to the Republican presidential candidate who best embodies Reagan's legacy.",771,4722,7,45

Berlin (AFP)

A bruising internal struggle to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel has left Germany's once stable ruling conservatives in disarray and on the brink of implosion less than six months ahead of elections in September.

The fight between long-time Merkel-ally Armin Laschet and his more popular Bavarian rival Markus Soeder threatens to further destabilise the once dominant CDU/CSU alliance, whose poll ratings have plummeted in recent months.

Elected head of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union in January, Laschet would usually be the first choice to lead both the CDU and its Bavarian sister party CSU into September's general election.

Yet his claim to be chancellor candidate has been bitterly contested by CSU leader Soeder, who currently commands more support from both the public and conservative lawmakers.

The scrap for Merkel's throne has opened up historic wounds between the two parties and could even loosen their 16-year grip on the chancellery.

With the clock ticking down to September 26 elections, the bitter divisions poisoning the conservatives spell a rocky campaign ahead for a post-Merkel era.

It also leaves them exposed, with the internal squabbles sapping attention at a time when Europe's biggest economy is struggling to end a raging pandemic that has killed 80,000 and ravaged thousands of businesses and livelihoods.

- Historic squabbles -

""The CDU/CSU has not seen a showdown like this for more than 40 years!"" wrote Bild newspaper after Soeder and Laschet exchanged verbal blows in a meeting with conservative MPs.

Yet it is by no means the first time that the CDU and CSU have been at odds over who should take the top job.

In 1980, CSU leader Franz-Josef Strauss was nominated ahead of CDU candidate Ernst Albrecht and his then unpopular party leader Helmut Kohl.

In 2002, meanwhile, the newly appointed CDU chair Angela Merkel stepped back to allow Bavarian rival Edmund Stoiber to run.

In both cases, the CSU candidate was widely seen as a more charismatic and voter-friendly option, before being ultimately beaten in the polls by the incumbent social-democrats.

Both Kohl and Merkel then defied their critics at the next elections, going on to become Germany's longest-serving chancellors.

That could bode well for the currently unpopular Laschet, who has been praised for his ability to ""sit out opponents"".

Yet while Kohl and Merkel emerged with the conservatives in opposition, Laschet has a tougher job of keeping the CDU/CSU in power as they squabble over the vacuum left by Merkel's departure.

The chancellor has held the alliance together throughout her reign, maintaining her authority even when the CSU openly challenged her handling of the refugee crisis in 2015.

""If the party has nobody behind which it can unite, then things become brutal. It was like that after the Kohl era, and it is like that now at the end of the Merkel era,"" wrote weekly Der Spiegel in an editorial last week.

The magazine argued that the CDU/CSU would be better off going into oppositon, and ""finding a new king or queen in peace and quiet"".

- 'United?' -

With the surging Green Party snapping at their heels, the prospect of losing power now looms larger than ever for the conservatives, who have hit new lows in the polls amid a corruption scandal and anger over the pandemic.

Divisions may remain even if they retain power, with lawmakers said to favour Soeder and CDU grandees having already backed Laschet.

If Laschet prevails, he will have work ahead of him to win back support within his own party ranks.

If Soeder gets the nod, it spells questions for the authority of the CDU's leadership which has thrown their backing behind Laschet.

""There are wounds that will remain, or in any case, that won't heal so quickly as to not leave a mark during the election campaign,"" said Spiegel.

On Friday, MPs from both parties were collecting signatures to force a vote on the issue next week if a unanimous decision could not be reached behind closed doors.

""This is already the third power struggle in the CDU/CSU in the last three years. That shows that the party has lost its orientation, its centre,"" wrote Die Zeit newspaper this week.

Yet others insist that the ever-pragmatic conservatives can still bounce back.

""Whatever happens, both parties will go into the election campaign in a united way"" political scientist Nils Diederich of Berlin's Free University told AFP.

""The alliance will not break down just because two people are competing to be chancellor.""

0,The Blood-Clot Problem Is Multiplying,https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/04/vaccine-related-blood-clot-mystery-must-be-solved/618623/,"Whether the blood issues are ultimately linked to only one vaccine, or two vaccines, or more, it’s absolutely crucial to remember the unrelenting death toll from the coronavirus itself—and the fact that COVID-19 can set off its own chaos in the circulatory system, with blood clots showing up in “almost every organ.” That effect of the disease is just one of many reasons the European Medicines Agency has emphasized that the “overall benefits of the [AstraZeneca] vaccine in preventing COVID-19 outweigh the risks of side effects.” The same is true of Johnson & Johnson’s. These vaccines are saving countless lives across multiple continents.

But it’s also crucial to determine the biological cause of any vaccine-related blood conditions. This global immunization project presents a lot of firsts: the first authorized use of mRNA vaccines like the ones from Pfizer and Moderna; the first worldwide use of adenovirus vectors for vaccines like AstraZeneca’s, Johnson & Johnson’s, and Sputnik V; and the first attempt to immunize against a coronavirus. Which, if any, of these new frontiers might be linked to serious side effects? Which, if any, of the other vaccines could be drawn into this story, too? How can a tiny but disturbing risk be mitigated as we fight our way out of this pandemic? And what might be the implications for vaccine design in the years to come?

To answer these questions, scientists will have to figure out the biology behind this rare blood condition: what exactly causes it; when and why it happens. This is not an easy task. While the evidence available so far is fairly limited, some useful theories have emerged. The notions listed below are not all in competition with one another: Some are overlapping—or even mutually reinforcing—in important ways. And their details matter quite a bit. A better understanding of the cause of this condition may allow us to predict its reach.

Theory 1: Platelet Problems

The leading theory behind the blood abnormalities associated with the AstraZeneca vaccine traces to a case from late February. A 49-year-old nurse in Austria who had received the vaccine developed clotting in her veins and arteries, along with a low platelet count. That’s an odd combination: Platelets are like the bricks of the clotting system, held together with a mortar of molecules called coagulation factors; when your body has a shortage of these bricks, it typically has a hard time building clots.

There are a couple of exceptions, though, as the science journalists Kai Kupferschmidt and Gretchen Vogel explained in March. In a condition called disseminated intravascular coagulation, so much clotting occurs that circulating platelets get used up. A rare reaction to a blood-thinning drug called heparin, which is safely prescribed to millions of people in the U.S. every year, can also produce the same signal. When that occurs, heparin attaches itself to a molecule called platelet factor 4, which is released by damaged platelets. The body mistakenly treats this complex as a pathogen before going on to attack the platelet cells directly, which sometimes leads to clots.",507,3131,5,37

The disclosure came soon before the resumption of talks in Vienna aimed at reviving Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with major powers, an accord Israel fiercely opposed, after former U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned it three years ago.

A fissile purity of 90% is suitable for a nuclear bomb.

Announcing 60% enrichment, chief nuclear negotiator Abbas Araqchi also said Iran would activate 1,000 advanced centrifuge machines at Natanz, a nuclear plant hit by an explosion on Sunday that Tehran called an act of sabotage by its arch-foe Israel.

However, an Iranian official told Reuters later that ""60% enrichment will be in small quantity"" only.

""From tonight, practical preparations for 60% enrichment will begin in Natanz; 60% uranium is used to make a variety of radiopharmaceuticals,"" the semi-official Fars news agency quoted Iranian nuclear agency spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi as saying.

The International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, said it had been informed of Iran's decision.

In Washington, White House press secretary Jen Psaki called Iran's announcement ""provocative"" and said the Biden administration was concerned, adding that it called into question Tehran's seriousness on nuclear talks.

Last week, Iran and the global powers held what they described as ""constructive"" talks to salvage the 2015 accord, which has unravelled as Iran has breached its limits on uranium enrichment since Trump re-imposed harsh sanctions on Tehran.

The deal had capped the level of purity to which Iran can enrich uranium hexafluoride, the feedstock for centrifuges, at 3.67%, far below the 90% needed for bomb-grade material.

Iran in recent months has raised enrichment to 20% purity, a level where uranium is considered to be highly enriched and is a significant step towards weapons-grade. Three-five percent is broadly the level required to run civilian nuclear power plants.

The biggest obstacle to producing nuclear weapons is accumulating sufficient quantities of fissile material - either 90% enriched uranium, or plutonium - for the core of a bomb.

One of the central objectives of the 2015 nuclear containment deal was to extend the time Iran would need to do this, if it chose to, to a year from about 2-3 months.

Iran says it has never sought to obtain or develop nuclear weapons, and that it seeks nuclear technology for civilian purposes in the fields of medicine or energy.

Western intelligence services believe Iran had a clandestine nuclear weapons programme that was mothballed in 2003, though arch-adversary Israel believes it continues in some form and sees Tehran's nuclear activity as an existential threat.

'Bad gamble'

Iran's top diplomat said earlier on Tuesday that the blast in the underground Natanz plant that it blames on Israel was a ""very bad gamble"" that would boost Tehran's leverage in the talks to salvage the nuclear deal.

""I assure you that in the near future more advanced uranium enrichment centrifuges will be placed in the Natanz facility,"" Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told a news conference alongside his visiting Russian counterpart in Tehran.

The nuclear talks are due to resume on Thursday in Vienna.

Tehran has said the explosion at Natanz, which knocked out electricity in centrifuge production halls, was sabotage by Israel and vowed revenge for the incident, which appeared to be latest episode in a long-running covert war.

Israel, which the Islamic Republic does not recognise, has not formally commented on the matter.

U.S. President Joe Biden has said Iran must resume full compliance with curbs on its enrichment activity mandated by the deal, which won the lifting of all international sanctions against Tehran, before Washington can rejoin the pact.

0,"A Category 5 Super Typhoon Surigae now peaks at 190 mph and 888 mbar, becoming the most intense April tropical cyclone on record, heading further northwest across the Philippine Sea",https://www.severe-weather.eu/tropical-weather/record-super-typhoon-surigae-tropical-cyclone-philippines-mk/,"Who would have expected the very first Western Pacific typhoon of 2021 to take so explosive intensification rate that has brought it to a record Category 5 tropical cyclone? The peak intensify has reached an outstanding 190 mph with the central pressure bottomed at 888 mbar. Only the most violent systems push the eye pressure so low. Super Typhoon Surigae has also become the most intense tropical cyclone for the month of April, surpassing the typhoon Maysak from 2015. Surigae track will thankfully miss the Philippines.

According to the official analysis by the JTWC, Super Typhoon Surigae has peaked as a Category 5 tropical cyclone, packing a remarkable intensity of 190 mph sustained winds (165 knots). Its central pressure has pushed to 888 mbar, which is incredibly low for any tropical system worldwide.

Surigae has explosively intensified from a 90 mph Category 1 typhoon to a monster 190 mph Category 5 storm within a period of only 36 hours from Friday through Saturday! This is even more than double the rate for rapid intensification of a tropical cyclone. The peak intensity has been set just shortly before the Eyewall Replacement Cycle (EWRC) started.

These data are based on satellite observation, as aircraft do not fly into West Pacific typhoons the way NOAA Hurricane Hunters do in the Atlantic, So we, unfortunately, will never know exactly how intense Super Typhoon Surigae actually is. We shouldn’t be surprised that the 190 mph intensity this Saturday might even be an underestimate.

Super Typhoon Surigae has therefore become the most intense typhoon on record for the month of April. And also becomes the first Northern Hemisphere tropical cyclone to reach sub-900 millibar intensity prior to May 1st. Breaking the previous record set by Typhoon Maysak in 2015. Attached below is the exceptional view of the eyewall of Maysak, known as the stadium effect.

Super Typhoon Surigae (known as Bising in the Philippines) literally exploded in intensity from a Category 1 storm on Friday to a beastly Category 5 monster on Saturday, with maximum sustained winds estimated at 190 mph with higher gusts.

Like we are almost used to see over the recent years, Surigae is just the latest tropical cyclone out of many that underwent a process known as rapid intensification, a process that leads to a very significant increase in winds and an extremely deep central pressure of tropical (or also non-tropical) systems. Warming seas are likely the cause for this, according to scientific researches.

Based on the latest model guidance, the northern portions of the Philippines are likely to spare the worst impact of this monster Super Typhoon. The model tracks hint at the Surigae to recurve out to the sea further north, so chances of it to directly hit the northern parts of Luzon are much lower now. Still, heavy rains with flooding potential and severe winds are possible.

Surigae is the first Category 5 tropical cyclone (of any category that includes hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones) to occur in 2021. A typical year brings about 18 tropical systems that reach a Category 4 or 5 around the world.

The driver behind these explosive tropical cyclone formations is very often the very warm sea waters and the wave known as a Madden-Jullian Oscillation (MJO). The combination of both has also lead to a formation of a strong tropical cyclone Seroja that struck Western Australia, just a week before typhoon Surigae formed. Seroja formed after a spectacular Fujiwhara effect of a merging system with a tropical cyclone Odette.

Typically over a normal year, about 8-9 tropical cyclone formations threaten the land of the Philippines. This is the highest number of tropical systems that strike any country around the world.

Typhoon Surigae remains an extremely dangerous system although its center is now forecast to miss the Philippines, it will still travel just a few hundred miles/kilometers to the east of the northern parts of the country. It may still affect the north-northeast Philippines (Luzon) with a huge amount of rainfall and severe winds and dangerous storm surge.

SURIGAE AS A RESULT OF VERY WARM PACIFIC OCEAN AND A MAJOR MJO WAVE

The sea surface temperatures of the western Pacific are very warm this spring, even extremely warm with hot conditions further west towards the Indian Sea. Temperatures are reaching up to about 30 °C (86 °F). Hot seas with temperatures even above 31 °C (87 °F) are being observed over the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea.

Such oceanic conditions are strongly supportive of an explosive intensification for any tropical cyclone. This is also the main reason why Surigae has literally exploded into a powerful Category 5 typhoon this weekend and reached a remarkable maximum sustained winds speed of 190 mph (165 knots).

The waters of the Philippine Sea remain warmer than the long-term average, about 1 °C above normal. Strongly anomalous sea temperature often leads to the explosive development of deep storms, that develop very well-organized tropical cyclones. And often undergoing a very rapid to even explosive intensification as we have seen with Surigae.

As it can be seen from the attached sea temperature anomaly chart, most of the western Pacific is well above average. Also further west across the Indian Sea. The highest temperature anomalies are observed around Japan and across the Northwest Pacific.

Notice also how cold waters are present over the Bering Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk, which is partially frozen. There, frigid Arctic conditions are still in place, as winter hasn’t left the areas that far north through early/mid-April this year.

Another factor that has recently significantly increased the potential for tropical cyclone developments over the western Pacific is the so-called MJO wave. The wave has well coincided with the above normal sea temperatures over the western Pacific. The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is the largest and most dominant source of short-term tropical variability. An eastward-moving wave of thunderstorms circles the entire planet on the equator in about 30 to 60 days.

The MJO has two parts, one side is the enhanced rainfall (wet phase) and the other side is the suppressed rainfall (dry phase). This means that there are increased storms with a lot of rainfall on one side and reduced storms potential and drier weather on the other side. The wet phase leads to diverging (ascending) air parcels while the dry phase brings converging (descending) air parcels. This horizontal movement of the air is referred to as the Velocity Potential (VP) in the tropics.

With the model data, we can easily track the entire MJO wave movement by looking at the larger scale air parcels movement. And can easily see the areas where the air is rising and where it is subsiding.

The graphics below, provided by Michael J. Ventrice, Ph.D. represent an MJO wave with filtered VP200* anomalies (see details below) for the current state, for the week 1 forecast, and for the week 2 forecast.

Cold colors are representative of a more favorable state over the Pacific Ocean for tropical cyclogenesis while warm colors represent a less favorable state for tropical cyclogenesis (e.g. over Africa and South Atlantic).

*VP200 – means a Velocity Potential (VP). It is an indicator of the large-scale divergent flow, so at upper levels in the tropics. The negative VP anomalies (shaded blue in the diagram) are closely tied to the divergent outflow from enhanced convective regions.

Notice how strong and deep the MJO wave is over the western Pacific. This is normally a *very* significant signal of the upward motion, supporting vigorous convection in the region where Super Typhoon Surigae formed.

But there is even more. Another important factor for the development and especially the intensification rate of the tropical cyclone is the Ocean Heat Content (OHC). The OHC takes into account the depth of the sea, and how warm the water layers are deeper below the sea surface.

The attached chart for the region of the western Pacific has recently hinted at a large pool of very high available oceanic heat energy. With a very warm water layer running down quite deep over the Philippine Sea. Taking a closer look, one can see how Surigae has been moving right across these very favorable conditions this weekend. No wonder why it has been so explosively organizing.

The deep waters are also quite warm which typically provides a very favorable environment of a thick layer of warm water. Tropical systems are fueled by these warm layers, as deep convective storms draw energy from hot water. So simplified this means that the thicker the warm layers are, the more fuel/energy is there available to feed the (tropical) storms.

SUPER TYPHOON SURIGAE WILL LIKELY SAVE PHILIPPINES FROM THE WORST

The initial intensity of the Super Typhoon Surigae has been set at 190 mph (165 knots), based on a consensus of multiple agency Dvorak Final T- number estimates ranging from T7.5 to T8.0 (165 – 170 knots). Therefore reflecting an extremely intense tropical cyclone.

The environmental analysis indicates a favorable environment with robust radial outflow, low 10-15 knots vertical wind shear, and very warm (near 30 °C) sea surface temperatures across the Philippine Sea.

Based on the advanced Dvorak estimation, the initial intensity is set at 165-170 knots, a violent and a powerful Category 5 tropical cyclone. The environmental analysis reveals impressive upper-level outflow ventilation, with well-defined gravity waves as well (see the infrared image at the beginning of the article). Attached above are the microwave and infrared satellite images during the peak intensity on Saturday.

The wind field of Surigae is very big. Its hurricane-force winds are spread across the radius of 50-70 miles, while tropical-storm-force winds are reaching out to 105 miles around the dead center of the typhoon. Notice how the gale-force winds (34 knots) are brushing the eastern Philippines, about 200 miles away from the center.

What is probably the most impressive to see is the intensification rate chart on the left, it indicates the increase in winds/intensity from its birth 4.5 days ago. The intensification was gradual and quite rapid until late Friday (local time) until it reached 80 knots and a Category 2 strength. Then becoming explosive for about 24 hours, reaching 165-170 knots and a monster Category 5 strength.

Super Typhoon Surigae will continue as a very violent system through Sunday, maintaining its Category 5 strength or maybe a high-end Category 4 intensity for another 12-36 hours. Surigae has become a very violent tropical cyclone and it will continue gradually moving northwest over the next couple of days. The wind gusts swath map below hints at an intense winds Surigae has developed – more than 250 km/h even forecast by the weather model.

The latest model guidance charts hint that the recurve more northerly than westerly will likely spare the northeastern portions of Luzon from the worst impact. Some weather forecast models are, however, still forecasting the storm could also get extremely close to Luzon coast by Tuesday, but the majority of the models keep the future track farther offshore with much less dangerous impact to the Philippines land.

Attached below is the rainfall total map over the next 5 days, based on the ECMWF model. A huge amount of rainfall (600-800 mm) is underway around the core of the typhoon, but the recent model data suggest the worst part could miss the northern Luzon island, as it stays off to the east. If eventually, a more westerly shift occurs, life-threatening flooding potential could develop. We can see 500-800 mm of rain will be possible.

Once Super Typhoon Surigae begins losing its strength and moves away from the Philippines, much less favorable oceanic conditions for fueling the tropical cyclone will exist. However, conditions should be very closely monitored if Surigae could threaten Japan island Iwo To or even Japan mainland later next week. Stay tuned for further updates!

0,"UK Parliament will vote on Thursday, April 22nd to declare\recognize the Uyghur genocide.",https://www.freedomunited.org/news/lower-house-uk-parliament-vote-on-uyghur-genocide/,"The House of Commons, the lower house and primary chamber of the U.K.’s parliament, is set to vote next week on a motion to declare the Chinese government’s actions in the Uyghur Region—which include systematic forced labor—a genocide.

Collective decisions on genocide are uncommon but not unheard of in the U.K. parliament, which in 2016 declared that the Yazidis, an ethnic group in northern Iraq, had suffered genocide at the hands of the Islamic State.

But because next week’s motion involves potentially accusing a fellow member of the U.N. Security Council, rather than a non-state terrorist group, the political and diplomatic stakes are considerably higher.

The government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson has already expressed that only international courts should adjudicate such an issue, meaning the vote will be dismissed as non-binding and ministers are likely to abstain.

But if at least two-thirds of MPs vote to back the motion, as its organizers hope, the vote could nonetheless have a significant international impact and strengthen the global movement against forced labor in the Uyghur Region.

The Guardian reports:

The motion due to be included on the order paper on Thursday reads: “This house believes the Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minorities in the Xinjiang region are suffering crimes against humanity and genocide.” It also calls on the government to fulfil its obligations under the convention on the prevention of genocide and other instruments of international law to bring it to an end. The motion points out that two of the UK’s closest allies – the US and Canada – have declared it a genocide.

Over one million Uyghurs and other Turkic and Muslim people have been detained in the Uyghur Region since 2017, with many forced to work in camps and factories across China.

The campaign of oppression—which has also involved forced sterilization, separation of families, and cultural indoctrination—has been described as constituting genocide and crimes against humanity by numerous experts and observers.

International condemnation of the events in the Uyghur Region has been met with fierce backlash this year from China, which has boycotted brands and sanctioned politicians critical of its treatment of its Turkic minority.

But next week’s vote, which is scheduled for April 22, could further strengthen the U.K.’s resolve against the Chinese government.

The foreign affairs select committee, which is conducting an official investigation into the Uyghur Region’s detention camps, is also poised to recommend updating the 2015 Modern Slavery Act to include mandatory human rights due diligence.

Freedom United has been a vocal opponent of forced labor in the Uyghur Region for over a year and, since last summer, has campaigned as part of the steering committee of the Coalition to End Forced Labor in the Uyghur Region.

1,I Get To Determine Whether Gay People Can Marry (by Clarence Thomas),https://www.theonion.com/i-get-to-determine-whether-gay-people-can-marry-1819584799,"Clarence Thomas

Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court

Last week, the Supreme Court decided to take up a pair of cases related to gay marriage, cases that will for the first time determine the constitutionality of laws denying marriage rights to same-sex couples. As a member of the nation’s highest court for the past 21 years, I can remember few rulings of such consequence as these two, which will affect the lives of so many people. So as the time approaches, I ask all Americans to think long and hard on what these decisions will mean for the future of our nation, and also think long and hard about the fact that I, Clarence Thomas, will get to determine whether gay people can marry each other.

Advertisement

That’s right, me: an embarrassingly undistinguished justice with a history of ethical misconduct who hasn’t spoken during an oral argument in almost seven years. I get to rule on whether gay people should have basic human rights.

Pretty crazy, right? I’m one of only nine Americans in a position to decide, in a matter of months, whether our democracy values the right of a group of human beings to get married.

Now, if you’re having a hard time wrapping your head around that one, you’re not alone. If you had told me in 1991 that I would one day have the power to decide the basic rights of millions of people, I would have laughed in your face. Back then, I was a 43-year-old appeals court judge with a flimsy record on civil rights and abortion who thought affirmative action was a form of “social engineering”—not exactly the kinds of views you’d expect in a jurist destined for the Supreme Court.

Yet lo and behold, that same year, despite accusations that I sexually harassed attorney Anita Hill, my appointment to replace retired justice Thurgood Marshall was confirmed. Soon enough, I was abstaining from oral arguments for years at a time and failing to disclose my wife’s sources of income.

I’ve spoken maybe two times in the past decade, for Christ’s sake. Think about that. That’s hundreds and hundreds of cases during which I’ve sat silently and twiddled my thumbs as my colleagues actively interrogated lawyers and posed tough questions about the scope and applications of laws—cases to which I barely paid attention, sometimes appearing to nap on the bench. And I get to have a say in deciding on a constitutional level whether or not all adult members of the human race have the right to recognize their unions? That historic judgment falls on my shoulders?

I’m not trying to belabor the point here. I just want you all to be fully aware that the future of gay and lesbian citizens in this country comes down to the opinion of nine people, one of whom—me—fell asleep during the inauguration of the first black president and believes states have the right to arrest illegal immigrants without a warrant.

Speaking of, here are some other things I believe: felons have the right to bear arms unless the state explicitly forbids it, Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided and should be overturned, corporations and unions should be permitted to spend unlimited amounts of money on political campaigns, and those campaigns should not be required to disclose donors.

Oh, and in 2003 I dissented in the court’s decision to strike down a Texas law prohibiting homosexual acts.

Advertisement

Yet in six months, in the year 2013, I’ll have the opportunity to decide whether hospitals can legally bar gay people from visiting their loved ones.

Take a second and think about the gay people in your life. Your best friend, your mom, your dad, your teacher, your coworker, your partner, you. I get to decide whether these people face institutional discrimination. The same goes for bisexual people, transgender people, and anyone else whose right to marry may be prohibited at the state or federal level. They are all searching for happiness, and their happiness all depends on the opinion of a man who once asked if someone put pubic hair on his Coke.

You want to hear something even weirder? Antonin Scalia gets to decide all this too.

So before these two judicial decisions are upon us, take a moment to reflect on what they mean for the future of our nation. As the tide of history turns and decisions of tremendous importance reach the highest court in the land, I will be there to judge them. Now, tomorrow, and for the rest of my life.",761,4406,12,68
0,Canada's Most Helpful Vaccine Resource Is a DIY Twitter Account,https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/v7e45m/canadas-most-helpful-vaccine-resource-is-a-diy-twitter-account-vaccine-hunters-canada,"The Vaccine Hunters Twitter page superimposed on a posts thanking the account for helping them find information. Photos via screenshots.

In response to incredible government ineptitude, four volunteers built Canada’s go-to COVID-19 vaccine resource almost overnight.

Vaccine Hunters Canada blew up on Twitter and Discord this week, with many of its 30,000 followers saying they never would have been able to get themselves or their family members vaccinated without it.

The small team has been posting up-to-date information on how and where to get vaccinated across the country, including last-minute changes and availabilities, bringing relief to people desperately waiting to get the shot.

“I hope you understand how amazing a service you’re performing for the community,” one person wrote on Twitter. Another posted, “Thank you so much @VaxHuntersCan I feel like I can finally breathe for the first time in over a year.”

Kerry Bowman, who teaches bioethics and global health at the University of Toronto, said the fact that so many Canadians are turning to a DIY social media account for vaccine information speaks to confusion and frustration with the vaccine rollouts, which are largely the responsibility of the provincial governments.

“It’s been poor planning, it’s been a fractured system and the public health communication has not been that clear,” he said.

“It didn’t have to be this bad. When you look at Britain and parts of the United States, it’s not perfect but they’re moving ahead.”

About 21 percent of Canadians have received at least one shot as of April 13, according to online research publication Our World in Data. By comparison, the United Kingdom is at 48 percent and the U.S. at 37 percent. Israel, at 62 percent, is the global vaccination leader.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau maintains all Canadians can be vaccinated by the end of September.

Bowman said the federal government got a slow start by failing to negotiate contracts with pharmaceutical companies in a timely fashion (or produce its own vaccine), and that Canada’s sprawling geography and the division of responsibilities between federal and provincial governments made things complicated from the outset.

Ambiguity around who is considered vulnerable, how to define an essential worker, and what health conditions qualify someone for a vaccine have contributed to further confusion, Bowman said, while online and telephone booking systems have been plagued with problems.

Thankfully, for all the incompetence at the top, we still have the unpaid labour of the working class.

Software developer Joshua Kalpin is one of four people currently running Vaccine Hunters Canada, on top of a full-time job. He got involved two weeks ago after an intensive search to find vaccines for family members.

Modeled off the American site vaccinehunter.org, the account often makes multiple posts an hour, giving its followers real-time information when there’s a pop-up site, an appointment slot that needs filling, a possibility of vaccine wastage or a change in eligibility criteria.

The team uses TweetDeck to aggregate real-time information from public health units and hospital networks across Canada, scours Reddit for helpful posts, and gets a growing stream of tips from the public that it verifies before posting.

“The best help anybody can get is from their community,” Kalpin said.

“People are scared, people want these vaccines so, so, so badly.”

He recognizes that only so many people can be reached online, and urges the account’s followers to spread the word to the less tech-savvy.

“Reach out to every single person you know—friends, family, coworkers, community, neighbours—and help them get their shot. That’s how we get out of this.”

Bowman said Vaccine Hunters Canada is part of a “fabulous” emerging network of COVID-19 volunteerism, citing stories of neighbours doorknocking to help seniors navigate vaccine booking systems.

“I see what’s happening in a positive way really emerging bottom-up as opposed to top-down. What I mean by that is it’s really coming from individuals, communities, online groups. It's not coming from the government,” Bowman said.

“I would say the people are doing better than the leaders are in a lot of ways, in terms of getting us organized and getting us through it.”",684,4347,10,63
1,Sociologist Considers Own Behavior Indicative Of Larger Trends,https://www.theonion.com/sociologist-considers-own-behavior-indicative-of-larger-1819565923,"BOSTON–According to the findings of a paper published Monday in The American Journal Of Sociology, the behaviors and experiences of Boston sociologist Dr. Stephen Piers are indicative of a host of wider societal trends.

Sociologist Dr. Stephen Piers.

Advertisement

""My observations indicate that the typical married American man has had increasing difficulty relating to his spouse over the last two and a half years, ever since she started taking those yoga classes,"" wrote Piers, 56, in his Interpersonal Connections Within The Marriage Paradigm: A Study In Causality.

In the paper, Piers asserted that the most pressing issue for American men is maintaining healthy sexual relations with their wives.

Advertisement

""Back in 1999, American men's frustration derived mostly from the infrequency of sex,"" the paper read. ""Recently, however, that trend has shifted as husbands report a decreasing interest in intimacy, particularly if there is a Celtics game or a new NYPD Blue on TV. While many men cite increased job responsibilities and stress as possible catalysts, many more blame the affair their wives had a year ago with some textile salesman during a training conference in Seattle.""

Though the paper originally focused on U.S. couples' growing intimacy problems, Piers was compelled to write about other issues, as well.

""Often, wives' repeated verbal requests, or 'nagging,' aggravate their husbands so much that they choose to spend every evening in their basements, listening to Miles Davis records and polishing their model train collections,"" he wrote. ""Many often report muttering 'castrating bitch' when listening to her shrill voice from upstairs.""

Though Piers is well respected within the sociology community, some colleagues charge that his paper breaks no new ground.

Advertisement

""On page 73, Piers reports that 'the married American male can no longer stand his wife's hyena-like laugh,'"" said Boston University sociology professor Dr. Theodore Muncie. ""I don't know if Piers keeps up on the literature, but I reported that trend almost three years ago. By the time Piers released his findings, the American husband's general attitude toward the laugh had long passed into the stage known as 'icy acceptance.'""

Continued Muncie: ""Piers also reports that American men seem to enjoy an after-dinner, single-malt scotch for the purpose of relaxation. Yet, as almost any reputable sociologist will tell you, that is inaccurate. The prevailing trend is to enjoy a glass of Merlot or possibly cognac, and it has been ever since upper-class U.S. males finished grad school.""

Piers' 1974 paper, Domestic Situationality: The Fortunate Male In American Society, was hailed as a landmark work almost immediately upon publication. Published one month after Piers' wedding to college sweetheart Angela Beckman, Domestic Situationality reported that American males were ""blissfully happy, despite lacking the freedom of single life."" However, in his 2000 paper, U.S. Wives: Lying, Cheating Whores? he found an enormous upswing in infidelity among American middle-aged wives and a parallel rise in the risk of fiery death among single male textile salesmen from Seattle.

""When that report came out, everyone told me I was imagining things, that it was all in my head,"" Piers said. ""But the evidence was clearly there for American men–the late nights, the secret phone calls, the way American wives seemed to be getting a lot more dressed up every time they left the house. All I can say is my wife Angela sure was upset when that report was released.""

Piers added that the average American male is unsure whether to get a chicken-parmesan sub at Luigi's Pizza or shrimp lo mein at Hunan Garden when they go to lunch in the next 45 minutes or so. He said that his paper on the subject, Gustatory Cognitive Dissonance In The American Male: 12 p.m. To 1 p.m., will be published later this afternoon.",625,3950,8,62

Preliminary results are expected April 25.

Deby is viewed in Europe and the U.S. as a key ally in the fight against terrorism in West and Central Africa. Within the country, though, there have been signs of growing discontent over his handling of Chad’s oil wealth.

Opposition leaders had called on supporters to boycott the vote.

In addition, a group of Libya-based rebels, the Front for Change and Concord in Chad, has been launching attacks. The group attacked a Chadian border post in the north on election day.

Chad’s army said Saturday that it had ""completely destroyed"" the convoy of rebels that attacked the country.

The British government said that two of the rebel group’s convoys were approaching the capital, N’Djamena, Saturday.

In a statement, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken warned that ""such actions would be deeply divisive, undermine the federalism process and political reforms that have been at the heart of the country's progress.""

It also jeopardizes ""partnership with the international community, and divert attention from countering Al-Shabab.""

Blinken further said the US was ""deeply disappointed"" and warned that President Mohamed's actions could erode the progress toward peace made in tandem with the international community.

The top US diplomat said the implementation of the law would compel his country to consider sanctions or other steps such as visa restrictions.

The United Nations Mission in Somalia (UNSOM), in a joint statement with EU nations, regional IGAD bloc, and the United Kingdom, said it was ""deeply concerned"" and would not support the extension.

""It seems the president ignores that every resolution or law requires approval of both houses of parliament, the senate and the house of representatives,"" Salat told DW. ""The residents in the capital Mogadishu are tired of war, and they are asking politicians to respect the constitution.""

Regional observers have also warned that Somalia's current political crisis could deal a blow to efforts to stabilize the fragile state after decades of civil war and an Islamist insurgency.

Somali legislators of the lower house unanimously voted to extend President Mohamed's government for two years

Somalia hits back at 'foreign allies'

Somalia has accused some of its foreign backers of undermining its sovereignty amid the threat of sanctions.

""While we appreciate the concerns of our friends and international partners for Somalia's stability and security, it is regrettable to witness champions of democratic principles falling short of supporting the aspirations of the Somali people to exercise their democratic rights,"" the country's Foreign Ministry said.

""Inflammatory statements laden with threats, which undermine the political independence and sovereign rights of national institutions, will only serve to embolden terrorist organizations and anti-peace elements in Somalia,"" the ministry's statement added.

Somalia's president, best known by the name Farmajo, and the leaders of the country's five semi-autonomous federal states had reached an agreement in September on indirect parliamentary and presidential elections in late 2020 and early 2021.

But it fell apart over how to conduct the vote, and multiple rounds of talks have failed to break the impasse. The new law paves the way for a one-person, one-vote election in 2023, the first such direct poll since 1969, the year dictator Siad Barre led a coup before ruling for two decades.

A presidential election was due to have been held in February. It was to follow a complex indirect system used in the past in which special delegates chosen by Somalia's myriad clan elders pick lawmakers, who in turn choose the president.

A 'constitutional crisis'

Abdi Hashi Abdullahi, the senate speaker, has slammed the move as unconstitutional and said it would ""lead the country into political instability"" and pose security risks.

A coalition of opposition presidential candidates in a joint statement called it ""a threat to the stability, peace and unity"" of the country.

""There is now a constitutional crisis in the country as the senate, or upper house speaker, rejects the extension for the president and the lower house. The fear of chaos, suspension among the politicians, is too high now in Mogadishu and other parts of the country,"" Salat, the constitutional expert, told DW.

Mogadishu residents are worried that the political crisis might plunge the country into turmoil

Somalis speak out

While some in Mogadishu welcomed the extension of Abdullahi Mohamed's government for another two years, others are apprehensive that the extension could plunge the country into a political crisis.

""I think the two-year extension is needed. The president has done a lot of good things in the past four years. The president tried to hold the elections, but some politicians and regional states have crippled the process. If all political actors agree, we hope to have popular elections or a one-man-one-vote election in the next two years,"" Ilyas Nor told DW.

But for Shub'eyb Omar ""the extension for the president and parliament is unacceptable.""

""The president failed to have elections in the country under his legitimate four-year term. Both the president and the parliament need to rethink about this unlawful power extension,"" Omar said.

Jamuria Ahmed, a mother of two, told DW: ""I'm happy with the extension for the president and the parliament by two years since the regional states and the central government were unsuccessful in ending the impasse on the clan-based indirect elections. We need to participate in the one-man-one-vote elections. There are political spoilers in the country who do not want to let our nation move forward.""

""My message to the Somali leaders and intellectuals in Mogadishu is to calm down and compromise for the interest of the people and solve all issues through dialogue. There are significant improvements and developments in our country, especially in Mogadishu, and we need to seize this opportunity, which is for everyone's interest,"" Nor Hassan, another Mogadishu resident, told DW.

Al-Shabaab militants in Somalia could take advantage of the crisis and carry out attacks

Somalia's complex politics

Somalia has not had an effective central government since the collapse of Barre'smilitary regime in 1991, which led to decades of civil war and lawlessness fueled by clan conflicts.

The country also still battles Al-Shabab, an al-Qaida-linked Islamist militant group. The group controlled Mogadishu until 2011 when African Union troops pushed it out.

Al-Shabab retains parts of the countryside and targets the government, military and civilians in attacks in Mogadishu and regional towns.

Somalia still operates under an interim constitution, and its institutions, such as the army, remain rudimentary, backed up with international support.

The 59-year-old President Mohamed was wildly popular when he came to power in 2017. The veteran diplomat and former prime minister, who lived off and on for years in the United States, had vowed to rebuild a country that was once the world's most notorious failed state.

However, observers say he became mired in feuds with federal states in a bid for greater political control, hampering the fight against Al-Shabab, which retains the ability to conduct deadly strikes both at home and in the region.

In February, some opposition leaders attempted to hold a protest, which led to an exchange of gunfire in the capital.

The entire one-party system we live under will disintegrate before our eyes if people lose faith in the process. Fortunately, the autocratic process in this country is very strong, so it’ll take more than a few critical words to destroy it, but what they’re doing is flagrant and dangerous. Our country is an autocracy, okay? It just is. If you don’t like it, you can go to Scandinavia.” At press time, the Democrats responded that they refused to let Trump and the Republicans try to ruin the future of the nation’s plutocracy.

The two nation’s addressed not only China’s increased military involvement in the South China Sea and security measures the PRC is using to pressure Taiwan, but also human right abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong.

The islands, also known as Diaoyu Dao, are uninhabited and administered by Japan, but claimed by China.

""Taiwan and Diaoyu Dao are both Chinese territory. Issues relating to Hong Kong and Xinjiang are purely China's internal affairs,"" the Foreign Ministry said. ""China has indisputable sovereignty over islands in the South China Sea and waters around them.""

You don’t imagine women in lycra hotpants, crop tops and red berets twerking in front of veterans.

That is, not unless you were in Sydney on Saturday.

Footage has gone viral of the 101 Doll Squadron dance troupe performing at the launch of the navy’s $2billion warship the HMAS Supply.

But all is not quite as it appeared in national news coverage, Australian broadcaster ABC has been forced to admit.

Read more:

It has apologised over its editing of the event, which suggested that the group shook their backsides in front of the navy’s top brass and other VIPs.

An ABC TV clip widely shared on social media appeared to show the chief of the defence force and governor general reacting to the dancers as they performed their energetic routine at the Garden Island naval base.

The defence force was criticised for sanctioning what was largely considered inappropriate entertainment, but it has since insisted that the dance was not part of the official naval ceremony.

And although governor general David Hurley was present at the event, he arrived after the dance show had ended, a spokesperson confirmed to 7News.com.au and other news outlets.

101 Doll Squadron has since hit out at the “deceptive editing” of the news clip, saying they felt “exploited” by the misleading coverage.

“We are very disappointed at the ABC’s deceptive editing of their video piece which cut to guests and dignitaries who were not in attendance, and shot from angles which could not be seen by the audience,” they said in a statement.

“We found this very creepy.”

The statement also condemned what they believed was the broadcaster’s “need to sexualise these women and their dance piece”.

“These are the images appearing in the media and the ABC have a lot to answer for in making us feel threatened and exploited,” they said.

The dancers said they found ABC’s coverage of their performance “very creepy” (ABC News)

Contesting the timeline presented in the news clip, the troupe clarified that they had performed before the formal event, and before the dignitaries arrived.

“A short piece taken out of context in what was a very long day performed before the official ceremony and before the arrival of dignitaries, and not part of it,” they confirmed.

“It was in no way meant to be disrespectful and we are hurt and disappointed it has been misconstrued that way.”

The ABC has now apologised over the controversial TV segment, saying a government MP had told the reporters that both the governor general and navy chief were present for performance.

“The video should not have been edited in that way and the ABC apologises to the Governor-General and the Chief of Navy, and to viewers, for this error,” the statement read.

The ABC has also added a correction to its original story, acknowledging that the video did not reflect the correct chronology of events.

The country’s prime minister Scott Morrison said he was ‘“disappointed” by ABC’s reporting.

“I am disappointed that this event was so misreported. I think that was disrespectful to the performers to suggest the governor general or others were in attendance in that way.

“I think standards have failed and so I think obviously defence will look at these matters and make what changes they wish to in the future. I will leave that to them. It is disappointing that Australians were so misled on that issue.”

The Sydney-based dance group have deleted their Facebook page and made their Instagram account private in the wake of the backlash.

The troupe, who specialise in dancehall and afrobeats, said they had worked on their choreography for Saturday’s event together.

They explained: “It was meant to bring an informal sense of celebration; a gift from one of our community groups to open a modern ship, with a modern dance form.”

We’re feeling pretty annoyed right now because we just walked into the OGN offices after taking the weekend off and we were met with a nasty surprise: W e forgot to drain our new Xbox Series X over the weekend, and now all the game fluid leaked out.

Ugh, this sucks.

Obviously, the manual says to drain your Series X every six to eight hours with the included syringe, but we just completely neglected to head into work a few times to open up the excess valve and make sure the video game runoff didn’t gunk up the works. It really spilled everywhere— the whole outside of the console is green with congealed gaming fluid, the fluid valve has shattered from excess pressure, and it looks like a fair amount of the stuff even dripped down the table and seeped into the carpet.

This is a major drag, and it’s made all the worse by the fact that we have no one to blame but ourselves. We even remember thinking on Friday, “Hmm, it’s been a while since anyone drained the Xbox, and we’ve been going pretty hard on Demon’s Souls lately, so we probably need to soon.” On the other hand, it was the end of the day and we didn’t want to have to walk all the way to the bathroom to flush it down the toilet. Oh well, we suppose hindsight is 20/20.

Oh, crap. Now that we’ve been standing in here for a little while, it’s really clear that the distinctive bitter gaming fluid smell has seeped into most of the fabric, too. God, it’s really noxious. Maybe it would help if we open a window or something.

We guess this is just one of those things that happens to you once and then you learn your lesson. Suffice it to say, we won’t leave the office again without double-checking each and every one of our Xboxes to en sure the gaming fluid dial is at 50% or lower. Honestly, at this point, this whole thing has been such a headache, so we’re thinking about maybe even investing in one of those automatic fluid changers that they sell on Hammacher Schlemmer.

Okay, gamers, well we’re going to grab some Lysol and paper towels and try to dab out some of it out of the drapes, but honestly, we don’t know if it’s going to require a professional cleaning or what. Yuck. What a morning.",412,2206,19,93

Some 350,000 Hong Kong people hold BNO passports and a further 2.5 million are eligible for one. Image: Shutterstock

Hong Kong people are applying for the bespoke visa route for British National Overseas passport holders at a rate of 3,000 per week, The Times newspaper reported on Friday, quoting leaked figures.



More than 35,000 British National Overseas (BNO) citizens from Hong Kong have applied for the five-year scheme, The Times reported.



The immigration route was offered to Hong Kong people in light of Beijing’s crackdown in the territory.



The British Home Office has forecast that between 123,000 and 153,000 BNO citizens and their dependants will apply in the first year, the newspaper reported.



It said some 350,000 Hongkongers hold BNO passports and a further 2.5 million are eligible for one.



With an additional 2.5 million dependants, up to 5.4 million Hongkongers could apply for the visa and a path to full British citizenship.



The UK government has put no limits on the number who could be admitted but expects many to stay in Hong Kong or prefer to move to places in the region, such as Taiwan or Singapore.



The permanent scheme offers a much more generous visa than previous routes for Hongkongers, including five years’ leave to remain. After the five years they will be able to apply for settled status and after a further 12 months they will be able to apply for citizenship.



This month London announced a £43 million fund to help Hongkongers to integrate into local communities. The programme will use 12 “welcome hubs” to help them to access housing, education and employment to build a life in the UK.



A British government spokesman said: “This new visa route reflects the UK’s historic and moral commitment to those people of Hong Kong who chose to retain their ties to the UK by taking up BNO status . . . [they] will be expected to be self-sufficient and contribute to UK society and the implementation of this visa is estimated to have a net positive impact on the UK.”",351,2075,8,45

Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III, who also chairs the country's Climate Change Commission, described the new target as ""ambitious"", though some environmental activists called on the government to do more.

Breaking down the target, 72.29 per cent is conditional on the support of climate finance, technologies and capacity development provided by developed countries, as prescribed by the Paris Agreement.

The accord, which came into force in 2016, aims to transform the world's fossil-fuel-driven economy within decades and slow the pace of a global temperature increase to well below 2 deg C.

The Philippines ratified the agreement in 2017, allowing Manila access to the Green Climate Fund, which aims to channel billions of dollars to help poor nations tackle global warming.

The remaining 2.71 per cent of the target should be implemented mainly through domestic resources, the Department of Finance said in a statement.

Under a ""business-as-usual"" scenario, the government estimates that the South-east Asian country's overall emissions during the 2020-2030 period will be 3,340.3 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e).

Greenpeace, however, called on the government to do more and for the Department of Energy to speed up the country's energy transition.

""Following the administration's pronouncements to fast track renewable energy and for a moratorium on new coal proposals, the energy department should be doing much more to put their words into action,"" the environmental organisation said in a statement.",281,1811,10,66

As the AP reported, the woman who originally posted the video, Shirell Johnson, said that when authorities arrived on the scene, Pentland was given a citation for malicious injury to property for slapping the other man's phone out his hand.

Social media accounts have connected Pentland to Fort Jackson in South Carolina, where he has been reportedly stationed since 2019, working as a drill sergeant at the garrison.

In a statement on Twitter, Fort Jackson Commander Brig. Gen. Milford Beagle Jr. said, ""The leaders at Fort Jackson in no way condone the behavior depicted in the video posted recently.""

Fort Jackson stated that the Department of Justice is looking into the incident and confirmed that Pentland has been charged.

""This action deeply impacts our community--the neighbors in the Summit, the city of Columbia, Richland & Lexington counties, and our Army family,"" Beagle said. — Fort Jackson (@fortjackson) April 14, 2021

Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott did not disclose the other man's identity during a news conference, the AP reported, but confirmed that he is not a juvenile. He stated that the man had been involved in other incidents in the neighborhood before the video but said that “none of them justified the assault that occurred.”

Videos on social media appeared to show protesters demonstrating outside Pentland's house. The gathered crowd chanted, ""We will make racist people uncomfortable.""

Officers raided the illegal weapons workshop in Santa Cruz de Tenerife in Spain's Canary Islands and arrested the owner, who has been charged with illegal possession of weapons and explosives.

The first such factory to be discovered in Spain also contained working 3D-printing equipment that could manufacture gun barrels in only two minutes, Spain's National Police said in a statement.

There were also manuals on terrorism, urban guerilla warfare and how to make explosives at home using a 3D printer, as well as white supremacist literature and a pistol holster with the symbol of the German army during the Second World War.

A specialist team of dogs from the police's TEDAX bomb squad sniffed out chemical substances that could be used to make explosives, the statement said.

Police also found nine ammunition magazines, two silencers, two pieces for rifle barrels and a plastic mold to make triggers, sights and other small weapons parts.

The operation took place on Sept. 14 last year but has remained secret by order of a judge, as often happens in Spain, until police were cleared to release details on Sunday.

The trio have been in custody since February 2020, but the case dates back to 2018 when one of them was the target of a planned attack on Danish soil believed to be sponsored by the Iranian regime in retaliation for the killing of 24 people in Ahvaz, southwestern Iran, in September 2018.

Tehran formally denied the attack plan in Denmark, but a Danish court last year jailed a Norwegian-Iranian for seven years for his role in the plot.

Meanwhile, the attack put Danish authorities on the trail of the trio’s ASMLA activities.

Police then arrested the three, suspecting them of collecting information on people and companies in Denmark and abroad, in cooperation with Saudi intelligence services.

Sunni Saudi Arabia is the Shia Islamic Republic’s main rival in the Middle East.

In addition to promoting and financing terrorism, the three men, whose identities have not been disclosed, are also accused of assisting Saudi intelligence on military issues, among other things.

Their alleged crimes took place between 2012 and 2020, prosecutors said.

ASMLA is based in Denmark and the Netherlands, according to Dutch authorities.",293,1792,11,58

0,Israel ends outdoor mask mandate,https://nypost.com/2021/04/18/israel-ends-outdoor-mask-mandate/,"Israel ended its outdoor mask mandate Sunday, now that about 80 percent of its adult population has received both doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, reports said.

“Being without a mask for the first time in a long time feels weird. But it’s a very good weird,” Amitai Hallgarten, 19, told Reuters.

“If I need to be masked indoors to finish with this, I’ll do everything I can.”

At the start of the pandemic last year, Israel required residents to wear face coverings while they were outside as long as they weren’t exercising. But now that close to 5 million people in Israel have received the two-dose vaccine, health officials are starting to ease restrictions, Reuters reported.

“The rate of infection in Israel is very low thanks to the successful vaccine campaign in Israel, and therefore it is possible to ease [restrictions],” Health Minister Yuli Edelstein said in a statement.

In January, Israel was grappling with about 10,000 new infections a day but amid a surge of vaccinations, that number has dropped to about 200 daily and hospitalizations and deaths are nearly non-existent, France 24 reported.

While the end of masking up outside is a positive step forward to getting back to normal, the country is still requiring anyone who enters the country, including citizens, to self-isolate.

The country’s health ministry noted that there are seven cases of a new Indian variant and they are still assessing the impact it may have on transmission.

“We are leading the world right now when it comes to emerging from the coronavirus,” Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters.

“[But] we have still not finished with the coronavirus. It can return.”",277,1682,5,32
0,Australia records first death from blood clots likely linked to AstraZeneca Covid vaccine,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/apr/16/australia-records-first-fatality-from-blood-clots-linked-to-astrazeneca-covid-vaccine,"Australia’s drugs regulator has determined the death of a 48-year-old diabetic woman who developed blood clots after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine was likely to be linked to the vaccine.

After a meeting of Australia’s vaccine safety investigation group on Friday, the Therapeutic Goods Administration said experts had concluded the case of the New South Wales woman, who died this week, “was consistent with causal association to immunisation”.

“In the absence of an alternative cause for the clinical syndrome, VSIG believed that a causative link to vaccination should be assumed at this time,” the TGA said in a statement.

The case is the third instance of the rare blood clotting disease linked to the vaccine in Australia but the first death. The TGA said the case had been “complicated by the patient’s underlying medical conditions, including diabetes, some other medical conditions as well as some atypical features”.

“In relation to this case, VSIG agreed that the case was consistent with causal association to immunisation although for this patient, anti-PF4 antibodies were absent,” the TGA said.

Anti-PF4 antibodies which activate platelets have been found in almost all other cases reported internationally of blood clots with thrombocytopenia associated with the AstraZeneca vaccine.

The TGA said despite the atypical clinical features and the negative antibody test a causative link to vaccination should be assumed.

Authorities said the woman had received the AstraZeneca vaccine on 8 April, before the government’s announcement that the Pfizer vaccine was preferred for patients under 50. She was admitted to hospital four days later and, according to local media reports, died on Wednesday.

Authorities including the prime minister, Scott Morrison, had earlier on Friday called for people not to jump to conclusions about the case, stressing that clotting events associated with the vaccine remained extremely rare and that the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risks.

In its Friday night statement, the TGA said there had been at least 885,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine administered in Australia, meaning the three cases of rare blood clotting equated to a frequency of one in 295,000 cases.

The UK regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, has concluded from its review of cases in the UK that the overall risk of the rare blood clots was approximately one in 250,000.

“The TGA is carefully reviewing all Australian reports of blood clots following the AstraZeneca vaccine and are requesting further information from reporters, where needed, to identify any further possible cases of [the clotting disease],” the regulator said.

“The overall number of reports received for blood clots following vaccination so far has been no higher than the expected background rate for the more common type of blood clots in Australia. These can occur in around 50 Australians every day separate to vaccination and are not related to the very rare TTS clotting disorder.”

Earlier this week, the TGA said a second case of a rare blood clot syndrome in Australia was “likely” to be linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine. The case came after a 44-year old Melbourne man also developed the syndrome earlier in April.

The TGA said those first two cases remained in hospital but were recovering well.",527,3351,13,89

Eleven people were killed and 98 injured on Sunday in a train accident in Egypt's Qalioubia province north of Cairo, the health ministry said in a statement.

The train was heading from Cairo to the Nile Delta city of Mansoura when four carriages derailed at 1:54 p.m. (1154 GMT), about 40 kms (25 miles) north of Cairo, Egyptian National Railways said in a short statement.

The cause of the accident is being investigated, it added.

More than 50 ambulances took the injured to three hospitals in the province, the health ministry said.

The derailing is the latest of several recent railway crashes in Egypt. At least 20 people were killed and nearly 200 were injured in March when two trains collided near Tahta, about 440 kms (275 miles) south of Cairo.

Fifteen people were injured this month when two train carriages derailed near Minya al-Qamh city, about 70 kms north of Cairo.

Egypt's transportation minister Kamel El-Wazir, a former army general, has faced calls to resign from some Egyptians on social media. He has rejected these and vowed to keep working on developing the ageing rail network.

The military rulers of Myanmar have ordered the release of 23,184 prisoners from jails across the country under a New Year amnesty, a Prisons Department spokesman said, though few, if any, democracy activists arrested since a February 1 coup are expected to be among them.

Saturday is the first day of the traditional New Year in Myanmar and the last day of a five-day holiday that is usually celebrated with visits to Buddhist temples and rowdy water throwing and partying in the streets.

Pro-democracy activists called for the cancellation of the festivities this year and instead for people to focus on a campaign to restore democracy after the military’s overthrow of the elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.

On Saturday, thousands of anti-military protesters took to the streets of Mandalay, the country’s largest city, demanding the restoration of democracy, according to images and reports posted on social media.

Despite a downpour, thousands of people also marched in Shan State to denounce the military.

While the military was freeing thousands of prisoners, it was also seeking 832 people on warrants in connection with the protests.

Aung San Suu Kyi is among 3,141 people arrested in connection with the coup, according to a tally by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) activist group.

“These detainees are mostly from before February 1 but there are also some who were imprisoned after,” Prisons Department spokesman Kyaw Tun Oo told Reuters news agency by telephone.

Asked if any of those being freed might have been detained in connection with the protests against military rule, he said he did not have details of the amnesties.

More warrants issued

Among the people the military is seeking to arrest are several internet celebrities, actors and singers who have spoken out against the coup, wanted on the charge of encouraging dissent in the armed forces.

Two of them, the married couple of film director Christina Kyi and actor Zenn Kyi, were detained at the airport in the main city of Yangon on Saturday as they were trying to leave the country, several media outlets reported.

A spokesman for the military government did not answer calls seeking comment.

Zayyar Lwin, Paing Ye Thu, Paing Phyo Min aka Dee Yay of #PeacockGeneration are among the released 23,000+ prisoners today on Myanmar's New Year after they have served prison terms. Welcome back, our friends.

More comrades for the revolution ! #WhatshappeninginMyanmar pic.twitter.com/BUk94SNt9m — Thinzar Shunlei Yi #WhatshappeninginMyanmar (@thinzashunleiyi) April 17, 2021

Myanmar has been in crisis since the coup, which the military defended with accusations of fraud in a November election won by Aung San Suu Kyi’s party, though the election commission dismissed the objections.

The now-dismissed government had held power for the first five years of civilian rule since nearly half a century of army rule ended.

People infuriated by the return of military rule have taken to the streets day after day to demand the restoration of democracy, defying crackdowns by the security forces in which 728 people have been killed, according to the AAPP’s latest figures.

Political leaders, including removed members of parliament, announced the formation of a National Unity Government (NUG) on Friday including Aung San Suu Kyi and leaders of the anti-coup protests and ethnic minorities.

Protesters march during a demonstration against the military coup in Mandalay on Saturday [Handout photo/Facebook via AFP] The NUG says it is the legitimate political authority and has called for international recognition.

The military government has yet to comment on the unity government but has said it will hold a new election within two years and hand power to the winner.

The hugely popular Aung San Suu Kyi faces various charges, including the violation of the Official Secrets Act that could see her jailed for 14 years. Her lawyers dismiss the charges.

Her supporters suspect the military will use the charges to exclude the country’s leader and perhaps her political party from any future election.",681,4265,32,196

On the other hand, though, maybe it’s the stress of a news cycle in which people from both political parties are invested in a series of increasingly baroque conspiracy theories guided by the grotesque and increasingly obvious lies we tell ourselves about American exceptionalism that’s making me feel kind of sad. There’s just this nagging feeling I have that it became very clear over the past 12 months that the basic building blocks of society are crumbling and there is absolutely no plan for changing anything at any level to avoid plunging the vast majority of humanity into cycles of ever-worsening suffering and violence. Maybe it’s just that being fundamentally powerless and living among other similarly disenfranchised, surveilled, and downtrodden people have made me feel completely alienated from any kind of community at all, or maybe I just need to get more sleep.” Carpenter added that he did plan to address the way he’d been feeling lately, perhaps by tuning out of the news and letting other people who weren’t ever even afforded the option to believe in the illusions of American society figure out what to do, or by trying to exercise more.

The Czech Republic has announced that it is expelling 18 Russian diplomats identified as spies over a huge ammunition depot explosion in 2014.

Prime Minister Andrej Babis said on Saturday the Czech intelligence agencies had provided evidence about the involvement of Russian military agents in the massive explosion that killed two people. He said the Czech Republic, as a sovereign state, had to react to those findings.

“There is well-grounded suspicion about the involvement of officers of the Russian intelligence service GRU, unit 29155, in the explosion of ammunitions depot in the Vrbetice area,” Babis said.

Interior Minister Jan Hamacek, who is also serving as the foreign minister, said the Russian embassy staffers were clearly identified as Russian military spies.

“Eighteen employees of the Russian embassy must leave our republic within 48 hours,” Hamacek told reporters.

In Russia, the Interfax news agency cited Vladimir Dzhabarov, first deputy head of the upper house’s international affairs committee, as saying Prague’s claims that Russian intelligence officers were involved in the explosion were absurd.

Moscow’s response to the expulsion of 18 diplomats should be proportionate, Dzhabarov said on Saturday.

Several explosions shook the Vrbetice ammunition depot, 330km (205 miles) southeast of the capital, Prague, on October 16, 2014.

The explosions killed employees of a private company that was renting the depot from a state military organisation.

Separately on Saturday, Czech police said they were searching for two men carrying various passports, including Russian ones in the names of Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov.

Those names were the aliases used by two Russian military intelligence officers who British prosecutors charged with the attempted murder on British soil of Russian spy Sergei Skripal. They and Moscow both denied involvement.

Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were poisoned with a nerve agent in the English city of Salisbury in March 2018. The attack prompted the biggest wave of diplomatic expulsions between Moscow and the West since the Cold War.",336,2213,9,65

Pune reported 11,047 cases and 47 deaths. Mumbai logged 8,803 cases and 53 deaths in the last 24 hours, followed by Nagpur with 6,395 cases and 23 deaths.

India today logged a record 2,17,353 daily coronavirus cases as many states - including Delhi and Maharashtra - grappled with shortages of hospital beds, oxygen, medicines and vaccine doses.

1,185 people dying of Covid in a day pushed the country's death count to 1,74,308. Over 2.17 lakh people tested positive for the virus.

Experts say people's carelessness in following anti-Covid rules and new mutant variants are behind the surge.

Both Maharashtra and Delhi have imposed night curfews and weekend lockdowns to fight the rapid second wave of infections.

The discovery of 77 cases of a new Covid-19 variant, which first emerged in India, has caused concern among scientists and the government.

Public Health England (PHE) said 73 cases of the B.1.617 variant have been confirmed in England as well as four cases in Scotland.

Officials consider it a “variant under investigation (VUI)” rather than a “variant of concern (VOC) such as the Manaus (Brazil) or South African variants.

Why are there concerns about the Indian coronavirus variant?

The Indian coronavirus variant is considered to have concerning epidemological, immunological or pathogenic properties.

Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the variant features two ""escape mutations"" – E484Q and L452R – which ""are causing people to be concerned"".

""There's laboratory evidence that both of these are escape mutations,"" he told the PA news agency.

""Basically, applying what we know about other human coronaviruses would suggest that this is going to be even less controlled by vaccine. But we don't know that for certain at the moment.""

Will the UK ban travel from India?

Covid-19 rates are soaring in India, with more than 13.9 million confirmed cases and 172,000 deaths.

However, the country is not currently on the government’s “red list” of travel ban nations.

British or Irish nationals, or people with UK residency rights, are able to return from red list countries but must isolate in a quarantine hotel for 10 days.

Boris Johnson has scaled down a planned trip to India due to its worsening Covid situation, and amid a warning from a member of Independent Sage that the scheduled trip is “crazy.”

How did the variant arrive in the UK?

Prof Hunter said it is ""not surprising"" that the variant has come from India.

""If you think about where the main variants have arisen – South Africa, the UK, California, Brazil, and now India – all of these are countries that have really struggled to keep case numbers down.

Story continues

""So it's not surprising. India has got a huge pandemic, and therefore that's where you're going to be getting the variant.""

He added: ""The big, big anxiety with this one is that it seems – and again this is still a little bit speculative because it hasn't been confirmed – but... there are two mutations here that are causing people to be concerned.""

How many variants does the UK have?

There are now seven VUIs and four VOCs being tracked by scientists in the UK.

A significant cluster of cases of the South African variant of the virus were found in the London borough of Wandsworth, Lambeth, Barnet and Southwark earlier this week.

A total of 600 cases of the variant of concern have been detected so far in the UK, an increase of 56 in a week.

It prompted a large-scale surge testing operation to test thousands of people living in working in those areas.

President Biden is ordering a new round of economic sanctions on Russia — a response in part to Moscow's election meddling and a Kremlin-linked computer breach that penetrated numerous U.S. government networks.

Biden said Thursday that the United States isn't pushing for ""a cycle of escalation and conflict"" with Russia, but instead for both nations to manage tensions and work together when needed.

But the president also said that during a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, he made it clear that any actions taken against the United States would be met with proportionate repercussions.

""My bottom line is this, where it is in the interest of the United States to work with Russia, we should and we will. If Russia seeks to violate the interests of the United States, we will respond,"" Biden said. ""We will always stand in defense of our country, our institutions, our people and our allies.""

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday afternoon that ""our objective here is not to escalate, our objective is to impose costs for what we feel are unacceptable actions by the Russian government.""

The sanctions are also meant to impose a penalty over Russia's continued occupation of Crimea, which it infiltrated and annexed from Ukraine seven years ago, and for reportedly offering bounties for attacks against U.S. and coalition military personnel in Afghanistan.

Psaki said that while the U.S. believes with ""low to moderate confidence"" that bounties were offered by Russia, ""we had enough concern about these reports that we wanted to have our intelligence community look into them.""

""We still feel there are questions to be answered by the Russian government,"" she added.

She said the sanctions signal that ""we are going to be clear to Russia that there will be consequences when warranted.""

On the possibility of a Biden-Putin summit at some point in the future, Psaki said that ""the invitation remains open.""

The Kremlin has denied any involvement in U.S. elections or on offering the bounties. Moscow has also said it had nothing to do with the SolarWinds computer attack.

Speaking after the measures were made official, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the ""aggressive behavior"" would lead to an ""inevitable"" response and that the U.S. would ""pay"" for the deterioration in relations.

""The United States is not ready to come to terms with the objective reality that there is a multipolar world that excludes American hegemony,"" Zakharova said.

In December, reports emerged that U.S. technology firm SolarWinds had been hit by a cyberattack that went undetected for months as the company sent out software updates with the hackers' code to its clients worldwide. The attack — first identified by cybersecurity firm FireEye when its own systems were found to have been compromised — later allowed hackers to infiltrate U.S. government networks, including those used by the Homeland Security and Treasury departments.

National security adviser Jake Sullivan, speaking with CNN on Thursday, said that the White House believes the sanctions ""are proportionate measures to defend American interests in response to harmful Russia actions, including cyber intrusions and election interference.""

A fact sheet released by the White House on Thursday morning said, ""The Biden administration has been clear that the United States desires a relationship with Russia that is stable and predictable.""

""We do not think that we need to continue on a negative trajectory,"" it said. ""However, we have also been clear — publicly and privately —that we will defend our national interests and impose costs for Russian Government actions that seek to harm us.""

According to the White House, the latest sanctions target more than 30 Russian entities and individuals it said are involved in election meddling. The U.S. is expelling 10 personnel from the Russian diplomatic mission from the country. The sanctions target six Russian tech firms believed to provide support to Russian intelligence.

The sanctions also include a prohibition on U.S. financial institutions participating in the trade of bonds used by the Russian government after June 14. They leave open the possibility ""to expand sovereign debt sanctions on Russia as appropriate.""

On CNN, Sullivan said that in a telephone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this week, Biden made clear that ""his goal is provide a significant and credible response, but not to escalate the situation.""

""We believe that altogether, both the actions we are taking today and that broader diplomacy, can produce a better set of outcomes for U.S.-Russia relations,"" Sullivan said.

Senior administration officials, speaking to reporters on background, said the U.S. has ""no desire to be in an escalatory cycle with Russia"" and that the sanctions are intended to be ""proportionate and tailored"" to the Kremlin's past actions.

While the latest sanctions are meant as a response to Russia's meddling in the 2020 presidential election, they follow on from Obama-era sanctions that called out the Kremlin for similar interference in the 2016 presidential race.

Former President Donald Trump repeatedly downplayed or denied any Russian involvement in the 2016 election, calling the accusation a ""witch hunt"" and a ""hoax.""

A U.S. intelligence report released last month confirmed that Russia sought once again to aid Trump in last year's election.

1,Nation Infuriated Sunday Comic Strips Still Wildly Unsynchronized With Weekday Storylines,https://www.theonion.com/nation-infuriated-sunday-comic-strips-still-wildly-unsy-1845030640,"WASHINGTON—Bristling with anger as they paged through the news over breakfast, the nation was reportedly furious this weekend that the narratives of the comic strips in their Sunday papers remained wildly unsynchronized with the plots of their Monday through Saturday counterparts. “Goddamnit , just yesterday I was reading contently about how Funky Winkerbean had placed third in a charity fun-run, and now they’ve dropped that thread entirely for some flashy, full-color story that tells me absolutely nothing about what happens next,” said longtime Indianapolis Star subscriber Dale Terry, 68, echoing the sentiments of millions of Americans as he wondered aloud when comic-strip creators would finally be held to account for the completely arbitrary and discontinuous sequencing they inflicted on readers each Sunday. “It’s like the past six days never even happened.

0,Duterte urged to confront Chinese ‘bullying’ in South China Sea,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/16/duterte-urged-to-confront-chinese-bullying-in-south-china-sea,"Manila urged to shore up its exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea by building structures within its waters or risk losing them to China.

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte must end his “policy of subservience” towards Beijing, lawmakers and foreign policy experts have said, warning that the Filipino leader’s silence is sending the wrong signal as hundreds of Chinese “maritime militia” vessels continue to congregate within Manila’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the South China Sea.

While several Filipino officials, including the country’s top diplomat and the defence chief, have openly demanded that the Chinese vessels immediately leave the country’s waters, Duterte has kept quiet for weeks.

During an address on Thursday night, Duterte did not mention the South China Sea. His spokesman said earlier that the president preferred to pursue his “diplomatic initiatives” in “private”.

Earlier on Thursday, the Philippine Coast Guard revealed that despite repeated demands by Manila that Chinese ships leave Whitsun Reef, at least 240 Chinese vessels remained in the area and surrounding waters as recently as Wednesday.

The vessels were first spotted on March 7 at Whitsun Reef, which is about 320km (200 miles) west of Palawan Island and within the Philippine EEZ as defined by the International Court of Arbitration at The Hague. Since the first reported sighting, the vessels have dispersed in an even wider area.

In a statement on Thursday, Senator Leila de Lima, an opposition member, warned that the Philippines could become “just another one of China’s satellites” if Duterte and the military failed to confront China.

De Lima said despite the expression of support by the United States towards Manila’s position in the South China Sea, Duterte’s “policy of grovelling before China” could prove detrimental to the integrity of the Philippine territory.

For almost 70 years, the Philippines has maintained a mutual defence pact with the US. But since Duterte came to office in 2016, he has nurtured closer ties with China, and has openly showed his disdain towards Washington, even threatening to end the US-Philippine military alliance.

Risa Hontiveros, another opposition senator, said it was time for Duterte to confront his “best friend” China, for its “blatant deception”.

“China is truly intent on refusing any diplomatic means of resolving our disputes,” she said.

The Chinese embassy in Manila has insisted that what it has called “fishing vessels” are only “seeking shelter” near the reef due to bad weather, adding that the area has been a traditional fishing ground of Chinese fishermen and that it is part of China’s Nansha Islands or Spratlys, which is also disputed.

‘Speak up’

Retired Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio, an international law expert, said unless Duterte speaks and defends the country’s sovereignty, China will not take the Philippines position seriously.

“THE PRESIDENT MUST SPEAK, HE MUST STAND UP HIMSELF, IF HIS SUBORDINATES DO THE TALKING CHINA WILL NOT LISTEN” Ret SA Justice Antonio Carpio says China will only take PH seriously if PDuterte speaks & demands withdrawal of its 246 militia vessels in EEZ of WPS #ANCHeadstart pic.twitter.com/DQhIePvd7z — Karen Davila (@iamkarendavila) April 15, 2021

“He must stand up himself. Because if his subordinates do the talking, China will not listen. And if the president is silent, then China will continue … the Chinese will take us seriously if the president will speak,” Carpio said in an interview with ABS-CBN News Channel on Thursday.

Carpio, who was part of the Philippine team that won a favourable ruling at The Hague in 2016, also dismissed China’s claim that the vessels within the Philippine EEZ are involved in fishing.

“The maritime militia vessels are manned by maritime militia under the payroll of the Chinese government. In fact, the maritime militia are placed under the command of the [Chinese] navy,” he said.

The Hague tribunal has said the Philippines has exclusive control of the resources within its EEZ. That ruling, however, was dismissed as “null and void” by China, which continues to claim almost all of the South China Sea under its so-called “nine-dash line”.

‘Weak approach’

If the “weak approach” of the Duterte administration in confronting China continues, more features within the Philippines’ EEZ could be taken over by other countries as well in the future, said Liz Derr, co-founder and CEO of Simularity, a US-based geospatial company that has been monitoring incursions in the South China Sea.

China has already built naval and air facilities on an artificial island on top of the Mischief Reef, which is also within the Philippine EEZ. China has also created an island at Scarborough Shoal, which was controlled by the Philippines until 2012.

“Unfortunately, the Philippines is weak. We’ve seen and documented what other claimants have been doing to shore up their claims,” Derr told an online forum organised by the Manila-based think-tank, Stratbase ADR Institute for Strategic and International Studies.

“We’ve seen how much weaker the Philippines is in protecting [its] territory, compared to the other claimants. If this weakness continues, we will surely see more features being occupied by other countries,” she pointed out.

The Chinese embassy in Manila has insisted that the ‘fishing vessels’ present in the Philippine EEZ are only ‘seeking shelter’ due to bad weather, adding that the area has been a traditional fishing ground of Chinese fishermen and that it is part of China’s Nansha Islands or Spratlys, which is also disputed [Philippine Coast Guard]

Shore up EEZ

Compared with the Philippines, Vietnam has shored up its sovereign rights over its own EEZ by building 29 outposts in the Spratlys, she pointed out. Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also claim parts of the South China Sea.

Derr conceded that it would be unlikely for the Philippines to recover the artificial islands built by other countries, including China, within Manila’s EEZ.

She urged the Philippine government to protect its own EEZ by occupying the unoccupied Spratly features.

Carpio, the former Supreme Court justice, agrees.

“Otherwise, China will beat us,” he said. “China will just put up something there, and there’s nothing we can do. We should put up structures within our EEZ.”

Meanwhile, former Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert del Rosario said in a statement on Thursday that he shares the concern of former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that the Philippines could become a “subject” of China if it does not stand up to Beijing’s “duplicity and being a bully”.

“In our opinion, Secretary Clinton is absolutely correct in expressing her fear that the Philippines could become a subject of China. To the last Filipino, under the leadership of [Foreign Affairs] Secretary [Teodoro] Locsin and [Defense] Secretary [Delfin] Lorenzana, we must finally stand up to Beijing’s duplicity and being a bully,” del Rosario said.

In an interview published on Tuesday, Clinton told the Philippine news website Rappler that she worried the Philippines would become “basically a subject of China through financial investments, through the buying of influence, through the undermining of institutions”.

“I think that there’s a real danger that, left unchecked, the Philippines – no matter who the leader is – would find itself increasingly unable to act without Chinese approval. I don’t think that’s the kind of future that the Philippines would like,” Clinton told Rappler’s Maria Ressa.",1198,7570,10,63

0,Matteo Salvini to face trial over standoff with migrant rescue ship,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/17/matteo-salvini-trial-standoff-migrant-rescue-ship,"A judge in Sicily has ordered the former Italian interior minister Matteo Salvini to stand trial for refusing to let a Spanish migrant rescue ship dock in an Italian port in 2019, keeping the people at sea for days.

Judge Lorenzo Iannelli set 15 September as the trial date during a court hearing in Palermo, LaPresse news agency reported.

Salvini, who attended the hearing, confirmed the outcome and said he was only doing his job and his duty by refusing entry to the Open Arms rescue ship and the 147 people it had rescued in the Mediterranean Sea.

Citing the Italian constitution, Salvini tweeted that defending the country was the “sacred duty” of every Italian. “I’m going on trial for this, for having defended my country?” he said. “I’ll go with my head held high, also in your name.”

Palermo prosecutors have accused Salvini of dereliction of duty and kidnapping, for keeping the migrants at sea off the coast of Lampedusa for almost three weeks in August 2019. During the standoff, some people threw themselves overboard in desperation as the captain pleaded for a safe, close port. Eventually, after a 19-day ordeal, the remaining 83 migrants still onboard were allowed to disembark in Lampedusa.

Salvini had maintained a hard line on migration as interior minister during the first government of the then prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, from 2018-19. While demanding that EU nations do more to take in migrants arriving in Italy, Salvini argued that humanitarian rescue ships were only encouraging Libyan-based traffickers and that his policy saved lives by discouraging further risky trips across the Mediterranean.

His lawyer, Giulia Bongiorno, said she was certain the court would determine that no kidnapping was involved.

“There was no limitation on their freedom,” she told reporters after the indictment was handed down. “The ship had the possibility of going anywhere. There was just a prohibition of going into port. But it had 100,000 options.”

The group behind Open Arms welcomed the decision to put Salvini on trial. “We are happy for all the people we have rescued … in all these years,” it tweeted.

Salvini is also under investigation for another, similar migrant standoff involving the Italian coastguard ship Gregoretti, which Salvini refused to allow to dock in the summer of 2019.

The prosecutor in that case, Andrea Bonomo of Catania in Sicily, advised against a trial, arguing that Salvini was carrying out government policy when he kept the 116 migrants at sea for five days.",414,2518,11,67

0,Serbs who fought for Moscow-backed militias in the conflict in eastern Ukraine say they are ready to take up arms again as a massive Russian military build-up on the border raises fears of more violence.,https://balkaninsight.com/2021/04/16/as-ukraine-conflict-intensifies-serb-volunteers-prepare-for-battle/,"Bratislav Zivkovic, who describes himself as a Chetnik commander and claims he was one of the first Serb volunteers to go to Crimea when it was annexed by Russia in 2014, also said he believed that the warring sides in eastern Ukraine “are indeed on the edge of renewing their conflict”.

“People here are absolutely against the war, not only in the Luhansk and Donetsk People’s Republics, but also on the other side, especially in the frontier zone. People whose relatives stayed on the Ukrainian side are talking about that,” Zivkovic told BIRN from eastern Ukraine.

Legislation in both Bosnia and Serbia prohibits going to fight abroad, and Zivkovic has previously been investigated in Serbia for taking Serb nationalist Chetnik volunteers to Ukraine. However, the investigation was dropped .

He claimed that there have been troop movements on both sides of the ‘line of contact’ between Ukrainian government-controlled territory and rebel-held areas, and that “shelling has also increased”.

Zivkovic cited allegations that a Ukrainian armed drone killed a five-year-old boy in the separatist-held village of Alexandrovskoye earlier this month. The killing has been denied by the Kyiv government. Zivkovic claimed that after this, “many people have come forward and expressed interest in the situation on the front”.

“There is an increased interest in this region now, not only in Serbia and Republika Srpska, but also in Montenegro, [North] Macedonia and even Bulgaria,” he added.

The trials that have been held so far may not have acted as a deterrent. Of the scores of Serb volunteers who have fought for Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine, few have been severely punished. Serbia has convicted a total of 29 individuals of fighting abroad, but most of them were given suspended sentences after admitting guilt.

According to a report by the Security Ministry of Bosnia and Herzegovina, over the past seven years, 11 Bosnian citizens have taken part in combat activities in Ukraine.

“At present one Bosnian citizen is away in the war zone in Ukraine,” stated the report , which was based on data from the police, intelligence service and other such institutions.

Of the 11 volunteers said to have gone to fight in Ukraine from Bosnia and Herzegovina, only one, a man called Gavrilo Stevic, has been put on trial. However, he was acquitted on appeal last year.

The dean of the Faculty of Criminal Justice, Criminology and Security Studies at the University of Sarajevo, Jasmin Ahic, said that the acquittal, as well as the failure to prosecute the remaining ten volunteers, showed that there was impunity for those who went to fight in Ukraine, while other Bosnians who went to fight for Islamic State in Syria have been jailed.

“This implies a distinction between those who fought in Syria and in Ukraine. This only goes to show that Bosnian citizens are not equal before the law and that there is no justice,” Ahic said.

Stevic’s trial did however show how some volunteers from the Balkans made their way to the conflict zone in eastern Ukraine. They travelled via the Serbian capital Belgrade to Moscow, from where they were transferred to Rostov-on-Don in southern Russia, near the Ukrainian border, then across to separatist-held territory in Donbas.

The indictment alleged that Stevic received help from a Chetnik association called the Ravna Gora Movement, and that Bratislav Zivkovic travelled from Belgrade with him and a group of other volunteers. In Rostov-on-Don, they were met by Russian military volunteers who recruited people to fight in Donetsk and Luhansk, as well as a private company that was looking for guards for a “humanitarian convoy” to eastern Ukraine, the indictment also claimed.

The Bosnian state prosecution told BIRN that it is still working with police and security agencies on several cases of Bosnian citizens going to fight abroad in places including Ukraine, but declined to provide further details for operational reasons.

REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov

The United States on Thursday imposed a broad array of sanctions on Russia, including curbs to its sovereign debt market, to punish it for interfering in last year’s U.S. election, cyber hacking, bullying Ukraine and other alleged malign actions.

The U.S. government blacklisted Russian companies, expelled Russian diplomats and barred U.S. banks from buying sovereign bonds from Russia's central bank, national wealth fund and Finance Ministry. The United States warned Russia that more penalties were possible but said it did not want to escalate.

The Russian Foreign Ministry reacted angrily, summoning the U.S. ambassador for a diplomatic dressing-down to tell him ""a series of retaliatory measures will follow soon."" A ministry spokeswoman also said a possible summit could be imperiled.

Russia denies meddling in U.S. elections, orchestrating a cyber hack that used U.S. tech company SolarWinds Corp (SWI.N) to penetrate U.S. government networks and using a nerve agent to poison Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.

U.S. President Joe Biden spoke on Tuesday to Russian President Vladimir Putin to raise concerns about those issues and the buildup of Russian forces in Crimea and along the border with Ukraine, although a top U.S. general saw only a “low-to-medium” risk of a Russian invasion in the next few weeks.

Biden, who also proposed a U.S.-Russian summit, is trying to strike a balance between deterring what Washington sees as hostile Russian behavior, while avoiding a deeper deterioration in U.S.-Russian ties and preserving some room for cooperation.

""My bottom line is this: There is an interest in the United States to work with Russia. We should and we will,"" Biden said in remarks to the press.

But ""when Russia seeks to violate the interests of the United States, we will respond,"" he said. ""I was clear with President Putin that we could have gone further, but I chose not to do so. I chose to be proportionate.""

Russia said Washington’s actions contradicted a stated U.S. desire to normalize relations with Moscow. The sanctions are hostile steps that heighten the countries’ confrontation, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said.

Among his moves, Biden signed an executive order authorizing the U.S. government to impose sanctions on any area of the Russian economy and used it to restrict Russia’s ability to issue sovereign debt to punish Moscow for interfering in the 2020 U.S. election.

Biden barred U.S. financial institutions from taking part in the primary market for rouble-denominated Russian sovereign bonds from June 14. U.S. banks have been barred from taking part in the primary market for non-rouble sovereign bonds since 2019.

He did not prohibit them, however, from buying such debt in the secondary market, a step likely to have a far more dramatic effect on the Russian bond and currency markets, which fell as news of the sanctions seeped out before recovering some losses.

The Treasury also blacklisted 32 entities and individuals that it said had carried out Russian government-directed attempts to influence the 2020 presidential election and other ""acts of disinformation and interference.""

ANALYST: RUSSIA TO CONTINUE TESTING U.S.

In concert with the European Union, Britain, Australia and Canada, the Treasury also put sanctions on eight individuals associated with Moscow's occupation of Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.

The White House said it was expelling 10 Russian diplomats in Washington, including representatives of the Russian intelligence services, and for the first time, formally named the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) as the perpetrator of the SolarWinds hack. The agency said the allegations were “nonsense” and “windbaggery.”

The U.S. government plans a new executive order to strengthen its cybersecurity, a U.S. official told reporters, suggesting it could include such elements as encryption and multifactor authentication.

The White House also said it would respond to reports Russia had offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants to kill U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan. U.S. intelligence agencies have ""low-to-moderate"" confidence in their assessment of those reports, in part because they rely on sometimes undependable testimony from detainees, it said.

Russia has long brushed off allegations of putting bounties on U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan.

Andrew Weiss, a Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank analyst, was skeptical the U.S. sanctions would change a ""largely competitive and adversarial relationship"" in the short term or deter Russia in the long term.

""I'd be surprised if today's very calibrated announcements by the Biden administration materially shift the relationship in either direction,"" he said, saying Russia was willing to cooperate on some issues but there was unlikely ever to be a meeting of the minds on Ukraine or election interference.

""I don't think it's realistic to expect the new sanctions will shift Russia's risk calculus in a fundamental fashion,"" he added. ""It's to be expected that the Russians will keep probing and testing our resolve.""

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) from her committee assignments would only leave her with more time on her hands. “If she has a lot of free hours in her workday, she’ll wind up using them to spin conspiracy theories, harass the survivors of school shootings, or openly advocate murder on Facebook,” said ABC chief anchor George Stephanopoulos, who echoed the concerns of many observers when he suggested it might be best if the freshman lawmaker and QAnon supporter was kept as busy as possible. “Why leave her twiddling her thumbs when you could put her on a bunch of committees where she’d be overwhelmed by endless hearings and tedious parliamentary maneuvers? Personally, I think it’d be prudent to assign her to the Agriculture, Ethics, Small Business, Foreign Affairs, Homeland Security, and Armed Services committees. Maybe put her on some Senate committees too. Whatever it takes to keep her occupied.” An hour after a House vote was scheduled to remove Greene from her committees, sources confirmed she had already tweeted out a theory that climate change was caused by secret Muslims running extension cords up to the Arctic Circle and placing space heaters near all the biggest glaciers.

This infrared satellite loop shows Super Typhoon Surigae bringing rain and strong winds to portions of the Philippines on April 18, 2021. (CIRA/RAAMB) Surigae became the first typhoon of 2021 in the West Pacific Basin during the middle of last week, then set another first after rapidly strengthening into a super typhoon to start the weekend. Now AccuWeather meteorologists warn that this powerful storm can bring dangerous impacts to the eastern Philippines. As of Sunday morning, local time, Surigae was packing one-minute maximum sustained winds of 138 mph (222 km/h) and wind gusts reaching as high as 166 mph (267 km/h). Surigae became the first tropical system of the year to reach super typhoon status on Saturday, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). At one point on Sunday morning, Surigae's strength was equivalent to a Category 5 major hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Eastern Pacific. The storm has since returned to the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane, which is still considered a major hurricane. This satellite loop shows Typhoon Surigae gaining strength across the Philippine Sea early Saturday afternoon, April 17, 2021. Surigae had developed an ""eye"" which often indicates a strong tropical system. (CIRA/RAMMB) The storm was given the name Bising in the Philippines once it entered the area monitored by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA). Once a tropical storm or typhoon enters this area, it is given a name by PAGASA separate from the international name that it may have already been designated. Light-to-moderate wind shear and warm water in the southern Philippine Sea will allow Surigae to maintain about the same intensity over the next couple of days as it tracks near the Philippines. CLICK HERE FOR THE FREE ACCUWEATHER APP The storm began lashing the eastern Philippines late Saturday as the outer rainbands reached the Visayas. Surigae is forecast to brush the eastern Philippines through the beginning of the week as it tracks just offshore, said AccuWeather Meteorologist Tony Zartman. On Sunday morning, local time, Catanduanes Governor Joseph Cua put mandatory evacuation orders in place for residents living near shorelines, riverbanks and landslide-prone areas in the Catanduanes province. A tumultuous sea could be seen just offshore of the province Sunday morning as Super Typhoon Surigae approached the area. All inbound and outbound flights have been cancelled at the Tacloban City Airport, located on the Leyte Island of the central Philippines, as heave rain and winds from the typhoon began battering the area. No damage has been reported as of Saturday evening, local time. The levels of impacts Surigae can unleash on the eastern Philippines will depend on when the storm gets pulled north by a nontropical storm system tracking over eastern China and Japan this weekend. The super typhoon is already beginning to turn more to the north, tracking just close enough for the heaviest rain and strong winds to reach the islands of Samar, Catanduanes and far southeastern Luzon in the eastern Philippines. This infrared satellite loop shows Surigae in the Philippine Sea on April 17, 2021 after becoming the first system to reach super typhoon status in 2021. (CIRA/RAAMB) Rain amounts are forecast to reach as high as 8-12 inches (200-300 mm) in the eastern Visayas and southeast Luzon through Wednesday with an AccuWeather Local StormMax™ of 16 inches (400 mm). This can lead to flash flooding and the threat for mudslides across the region. Across the rest of the eastern Philippines, 2-4 inches (50-100 mm) of rain is expected. Winds from the storm will be highly dependent on how close the typhoon tracks to the coast, though Zartman anticipates the possibility for wind gusts to near 160 km/h (100 mph), which can lead to power outages and some structural damage. However, if the super typhoon is pulled north sooner, the heaviest rain and strongest winds can remain just offshore of the eastern Philippines. Regardless of the exact track, the strong winds from the storm are likely to produce dangerous seas across the eastern Philippines beginning late this week and continuing into early next week. Boaters should use caution if venturing into offshore waters. After turning to the north, Surigae may lose some forward momentum during the second half of next week. By the end of the week, another nontropical storm is forecast to track from China to Japan. This storm may to pick up Surigae and turn the typhoon to the east before it gets absorbed by the system. After turning to the north of the Philippines, Surigae is likely to run into less favorable conditions for tropical cyclones, said Zartman, adding that this could cause the storm to lose wind intensity later next week. Surigae will still have to be watched closely as impacts to Iwo To and the Volcano Islands to the south of mainland Japan cannot yet be ruled out. As the storm was strengthening late last week it brought 9.09 inches (231 mm) of rainfall to Koror, the largest city in Palau, in just 24 hours. While there is no official start or end date to the tropical season in the West Pacific, most tropical systems develop between May and October.

0,Kataib Hezbollah controls access points to key Iraqi border city,https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2021/04/kataib-hezbollah-controls-access-points-key-iraqi-border-city,"AL-OBEIDI, Iraq — Roughly a dozen young men in black, olive green and camouflage mull around below the arches of the Sheikh Haidar checkpoint between the town of al-Obeidi and the border city of Qaim.

Arches curve over both sides of the checkpoint while a large poster of Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a senior Iraqi security commander from Kataib Hezbollah killed in a US drone strike near Baghdad in January 2020, draws the attention of anyone passing through.

The checkpoint is named after a member of the Shiite-led Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) killed in the war against the Islamic State (IS) in this Sunni-dominant region.

Qaim residents say Kataib Hezbollah and other nonstate armed groups have tightened their grip in the Iraqi-Syrian border area despite measures taken over the past year to reduce the influence of nonstate armed groups across the country.

A Feb. 25 airstrike by the US military on positions held by Kataib Hezbollah and Kataib Sayyid al-Shuhada in the Albu Kamal area of Syria just across the border from Qaim was the first known offensive military action taken by the Joe Biden administration, which took office in late January. The airstrike was carried out in retaliation for rocket attacks on bases hosting international forces.

Kataib Hezbollah claimed that only one of its fighters had been killed in the attack, though other sources and media outlets cited much higher figures. On Feb. 28, Kataib Hezbollah spokesman Mohamed Mohi claimed in a message to this reporter that there had been airstrikes in both Syria and Iraq, but both officials and Qaim residents deny this. Kataib Hezbollah issued a statement claiming the airstrike was an “insult to Iraqi sovereignty.”

Kataib Hezbollah has three brigades within the government-salaried PMU, two of which are deployed in western Anbar. This part of the group officially answers to the central government. However, Kataib Hezbollah as a whole operates outside of Iraqi government control and most analysts say it is linked to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. It is part of the Shiite ""muqawama,"" or Iran-linked ‘resistance’ factions, and was designated a terrorist group by the United States in 2009.

A Washington Institute profile published earlier this month stated, “In practice, KH PMF (PMU) Brigades frequently disobey the GoI (Government of Iraq) chain of command while remaining legally organs of the Iraqi state.”

Several Iran-linked Shiite armed groups have been crossing the Iraqi-Syrian border nearby since the area was retaken from IS in late 2017. Many have been accused of smuggling for profit and not just transporting weapons and men “for the fight against IS,” as is often claimed.

A local security official in Qaim told this reporter on a visit to the district in early April that PMU fighters had gone around the residential areas near the border and demanded to search the call logs of locals’ cellphones after the February airstrike, and that Kataib Hezbollah had set up their own video surveillance network in the city’s markets.

The district of Qaim includes the main city with the town council buildings and hospital, as well as the Husaybah border area, al-Obeidi further east and Roumana, north of the Euphrates River and linked by a bridge now controlled by the PMU.

Local dignitaries who in early 2020 had spoken more openly about the situation to Al-Monitor were in early April wary of speaking about the PMU and other nonstate actors operating in the area.

“It isn’t useful,” Sheikh Sabah, the top sheikh of the Albu Mahal tribe, one of the largest in the area, told Al-Monitor during an interview in al-Obeidi. “We want to speak about what we need. And we need everything. Services. We don’t have enough water, electricity. We need more support for agriculture. Jobs. Everything.”

Next to his relatively simple diwan stands the ruins of his former, palatial home destroyed by al-Qaeda in Iraq in previous years after his tribe rose up against it.

Others close to the top Albu Mahal sheikh say he and many others have land that had previously been used for agriculture south of the main road running from Ramadi to Qaim in an area now “occupied by the PMU.”

“There will be problems with them [PMU] in the future,” many locals say. But, for now, they just want to survive and recover. For that, they say, abiding by the rules of the dominant military forces is essential: in this case, apparently, the PMU.

Abu Aya, a former Qaim Swat commander and current commander of the local tribal PMU Kataib al-Hamza — which was initially formed in the post-2003 years to fight the US 'occupation' but later collaborated with the United States in fighting al-Qaeda and was reformed to fight IS — told Al-Monitor in an April 8 interview that though there were other PMU brigades operating in the area, Kataib Hezbollah was in control and that they were preventing local residents from returning to farm thousands of plots of land south of Qaim “for security reasons.”

During a visit to the Qaim district in early April, Al-Monitor was denied access at the final checkpoint to the city by the nonlocal PMU manning it.

Al-Monitor had authorization from the Joint Operations Command (JOC) to access all of western Anbar for reporting purposes. This reporter had previously made several trips to the area since accompanying the Iraqi army in the operations to retake the area from IS in late 2017, and has accompanied various Iraqi forces on frontlines over the years, including several PMU.

Local sheikhs, security forces and the army all tried unsuccessfully to gain permission for this reporter to cross the checkpoint from the PMU. The response was simply that people “higher up” in the PMU had rejected the request.

Nonlocal PMU including muqawama groups, such as Asaib Ahl al-Haq, took part in the battle for Qaim on the border but not Rawa, which lies further east and north along the Euphrates River. Rawa is not as strategic for controlling the border between Iraq and Syria.

Nonlocal PMU are officially supposed to stay out of Qaim and only guard areas outside of it, Al-Monitor was told by local security forces. They added that this agreement had been reached in previous years after much pressure from the local community and tribes. Nonetheless, many Iran-linked armed groups continue to circulate there, locals say, and now “control all access points.”

Compared with previous visits by Al-Monitor, two more checkpoints for key access points to the city had changed hands from the army to the nonlocal PMU, several local security sources told Al-Monitor.

A Kataib Hezbollah spokesman had not responded by the time of publication to an April 15 request for comment.

In referring to the PMU, a member of the local security forces told Al-Monitor, “They say we are haram and they are halal. That all foreigners — except the Lebanese and Iranians — are enemies. They are the same as IS,” presumably referring to the armed groups’ ""occupation"" of land and religious ""jihad"" being their stated aim for fighting.

“Go on the road they control between here and Akashat and you’ll see what they are like,” he said.

Akashat is south of the city, between Qaim and Rutba, on a road controlled by nonlocal PMU.

“Write that but don’t use my name,” he added. “We have to live here even after you are gone.",1224,7332,10,64

Ron DeSantis at a press conference, adding that Saudi officials’ decision to limit the annual pilgrimage to the sacred birthplace of Muhammad to just residents of the kingdom was clearly overriden by phase 3 guidelines in Florida’s reopening process. “Look, the Saudi government can say whatever it wants, but what about states’ rights? We must rise up against this government tyranny, because they have no right to stop any Floridian from making the journey to the Kaaba. In fact, we are encouraging all Florida residents to assert their right to perform the rites of the hajj in the holy city of Mecca and enjoy their constitutional freedom to properly honor Muhammad. We will also challenge any mosque that prohibits entry because a Florida resident isn’t wearing a mask.” State officials added that if any Floridian gets coronavirus from their hajj, it was simply because Allah has willed it.",226,1412,15,102
1,Family Left Elderly Grandmother To Die In Nursing Home But Not Like This,https://local.theonion.com/family-left-elderly-grandmother-to-die-in-nursing-home-1843922346,"MURFREESBORO, TN—Shocked to learn the grandmother of seven had died suddenly of Covid-19, a local family told reporters Friday they had left their elderly relative Beverly Foley to die in a nursing home, but not like this. “When we checked Nana into Woodpoint Crest, we figured we’d leave her there and forget about her until she died, obviously—we just never thought this would be the way it happened,” said grandson Greg Foley, explaining that the entire family operated under the assumption that the 82-year-old’s inevitable death at the assisted-living facility would occur as nature took its course and not as the result of a rapidly spreading infectious disease. “Even though I had definitely imagined her passing away in that very bed and in that very room, I had always thought it would be different. To think that instead of succumbing slowly to the infirmities of old age and dying alone, she succumbed quickly to Covid and died alone...it’s just too much. I thought I’d at least see her one more time, next year, on her birthday.” At press time, relatives reported feeling heartbroken that they were legally not allowed to attend the funeral that most of them would have skipped.

Dalati Nohra/Handout via REUTERS

The United States stands ready to facilitate maritime border talks between Lebanon and Israel that will have benefits for the crisis-hit Lebanese economy, a U.S. envoy said on Thursday.

On a visit to Beirut, Under Secretary of State David Hale blamed Lebanese leaders for failing to end a deadlock in cabinet talks to tackle the collapse, which has crashed the currency. He warned that ""those who continue to obstruct"" progress open themselves up to punitive actions, without naming individuals.

As part of its pressure campaign on Tehran, Washington escalated sanctions last year against Lebanese allies of Hezbollah, hitting former ministers on charges of corruption and ties to the Iran-backed group, which it classifies as terrorist.

Hale accused Hezbollah and Iran of undermining the state after meeting on Thursday with Lebanese President Michel Aoun, a political ally of the group whose son-in-law became a target of U.S. sanctions.

Hale said that talks with Iran on reviving a 2015 nuclear deal could foster regional stability but ""would only be the beginning of our work"" as the United States addresses ""the other elements of Iran's destabilising behavior"".

While pledging not to abandon U.S. interests in Lebanon, Hale said resolving a maritime border dispute with Israel would ""have potential to unlock significant economic benefits for Lebanon"". read more

The two neighbouring enemies launched negotiations last year, a culmination of years of U.S. diplomacy, which have since stalled. The dispute has held up offshore exploration in the eastern Mediterranean. While Israel pumps gas from offshore fields, Lebanon has yet to find commercial reserves.

A statement issued by the Lebanese presidency later said Aoun had asked to accredit international experts to draw border lines according to international law for the area and asked that no oil and gas exploration work be done in the waters in the meantime.

A Lebanese draft decree expanding the country's claims by around 1,400 square kilometers has been approved by the caretaker prime minister and two senior ministers and is awaiting presidential and full cabinet approval. read more

Chile's health authorities said on Thursday they believed a dip in the record case numbers the Andean nation has seen over the past week represents a ""stabilization"" of a second COVID-19 wave thanks to strict lockdowns and a rapid vaccination program that has fully innoculated a third of the population.

Health minister Enrique Paris told reporters he hoped the 9,000 record daily cases reached last week represented the peak of the latest outbreak.

""Once we reach that peak, we expect not a reduction but a stabilization and then a return to smaller numbers of positive patients,"" he said.

Chile has now vaccinated 50% of its 15 million-strong target population with at least one dose of the Pfizer or Sinovac-developed drugs, and given 32.7% two doses, Paris said.

He said stricter lockdowns now covering more than 80% of the country, coupled with public awareness campaigns, should allow Chile to hold elections on May 15 to pick constituents to draft a new constitution as well as local government officials. The election was postponed from April.

Chile's experience of the pandemic is being watched anxiously by many beyond its borders to see how much its vaccination campaign - one of the world's fastest and most extensive to date - will mitigate successive waves of the virus.

On Friday, it will become one of the first countries in the world to release ""real world"" data showing how effective the vaccines have been in reducing contagion, serious illness and death.

Health experts remain divided on whether the lockdowns and vaccines will be enough to curb the second wave imminently or whether fresh strains of the virus, limited vaccine efficiency and citizen defiance of sanitary measures will continue to drive the numbers higher.

Paula Daza, the country's top public health official, said the vaccines were already reducing contagion rates and hospital admissions of older groups who were innoculated first.

""People under 50 represent 65% of confirmed (COVID-19) cases and 41% of those being hospitalized,"" she said.

Claudia Reyes, a 38-year-old ICU nurse at Santiago's Workers' Hospital, said they had seen an ""exponential"" increase in cases of largely younger patients.

She said fatigue or indifference to the lockdowns was evident among the general population, despite daily broadcasts about the severity of the second wave.

""There are so many people on the streets, on public transport,"" she said. ""It feels like last year the population was better contained but this time, regardless of the COVID situation, that there are fewer or no hospital beds left, people's awareness is not in keeping with the reality.""

1,"Bitter Feud Developing Between Joakim Noah, Rest Of Humanity",https://sports.theonion.com/bitter-feud-developing-between-joakim-noah-rest-of-hum-1819574981,"MIAMI—As the Chicago Bulls prepare to face the Miami Heat in what is a must-win playoff elimination game for Chicago, sources around the world confirmed Wednesday that a bitter feud is rapidly building up between Bulls center Joakim Noah and the rest of the human race.

The growing resentment that reportedly developed in recent years between Noah and every other man, woman, and child living on the earth has swelled into a full-blown acrimony, according to the impassioned testimonials from irate individuals on all seven continents.

“There’s always been bad blood between Joakim Noah and those other 7 billion people,” said Cleveland resident and Cavaliers fan Javier Batista, adding that something about the Chicago post player has always rubbed him and every other human being the wrong way. “On one side, you’ve got this cocky loudmouth whose entire game consists of snatching rebounds, and on the other you’ve got the totality of human life besides Noah who just want to see him fall flat on his ugly face, so, yeah, you can see how there would be some tension.”

“God, I fucking hate him,” continued Batista, who is a target of intense dislike from the NBA All-Star.

According to reports, the simmering hostilities between Noah and the rest of mankind date back to the athlete’s tenure with the University of Florida basketball program beginning in 2004, when the 6’11” center started nurturing a series of vitriolic rivalries with players on opposing teams and their fans. The blistering enmity, 7 billion sources confirmed, quickly spread throughout the human population.

Today, this mutual antagonism encompasses the Bulls star’s tumultuous back-and-forth with referees, sports pundits, and Chicago Bulls fans, all of whom despise Noah, and who in turn are despised by him.

Additionally, sources confirmed that the reciprocated animosity extends to Noah’s relationship with each and every other segment of humanity, including Zen Buddhists, Europe, newborn babies, and the Guajá tribespeople of Brazil, who, despite having extremely limited contact with the outside world, maintain a bright, burning hatred for the Bulls center that is returned by Noah every time he struts out onto the court.

“Yeah, Joakim and all other people have always had it in for each other, but you can definitely see it start to bubble over lately,” said Bulls head coach Tom Thibodeau, emphasizing the difficulty in managing an infuriating individual with whom he has exchanged heated words and physical threats on a daily basis.“The way he talks trash every second he’s on the court and beats his chest after making easy tip-ins—and especially that shifty little smirk of his—well, honestly, I’m surprised the world’s peoples haven’t yet stormed the floor and torn him limb from limb.”

“That piece of shit,” added Thibodeau, echoing the feelings of literally everyone on the planet except for Noah himself.

However, such sentiment hasn’t yet fazed the two-time NCAA Championship winner, who, when reached for comment, said he wasn’t going to allow his ongoing feud with the human race to affect his game.

“I tune out all that stuff,” said Noah while staring down the reporter of this article, who even now is seething with rage just thinking about the lanky motherfucker bitching to the refs about a no-call. “Right now, I’m focused on playing good ball and getting a ring, no matter what my teammates, David Stern, various world leaders, the Screen Actors Guild, coma patients, Joni Mitchell, my childhood kindergarten teacher, you, and my parents might think of me. And if any of those billions of people feel like talking shit, they can do it while I’m on my way to the basket.”

0,Alexey Navalny's press secretary says he's 'dying' as Russian prosecutors target his foundation,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/17/world/alexey-navalny-health-gets-worse/index.html,"Moscow (CNN) The Moscow Prosecutor's Office filed a lawsuit on Friday with Moscow City Court seeking to label jailed Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny's anti-corruption foundation known as FBK and his headquarters as ""extremist"" organizations.

Meanwhile, Navalny's supporters say that his medical condition is rapidly deteriorating. His press secretary said that Navalny was ""dying"" and his doctors said medical tests showed he's at growing risk of renal failure and heart problems.

If approved, the move by prosecutors could have serious consequences for Navalny's team in Russia. In Russian law, ""extremist"" organizations could be banned and liquidated, and activists who continue to work with them possibly face prison terms of up to 10 years.

""Under the cover of liberal slogans, these organizations are engaged in creating conditions for the destabilization of the social and socio-political situation,"" the prosecutor's office said in a statement on Friday.

The statement added the goals of the opposition organizations is to encourage ""color revolutions,"" a reference to popular uprisings in former Soviet republics which Russia considers to have been supported by Western governments.

""The actual goals of their activities are to create conditions for changing the foundations of the constitutional system, including using the scenario of the 'color revolution.' ""

Navalny continues his hunger strike

Attending physicians for Navalny , an outspoken critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said Saturday on Twitter they wrote a letter to Russian prison services (FSIN) requesting access to see Navalny.

They say latest medical tests showed he is at growing risk of renal failure and heart problems.

CNN is not able to independently verify the state of Navalny's health.

The letter shared on Twitter by a key Navalny ally and head of a prominent opposition doctor's union, Anastasia Vasilyeva, said Navalny's doctors have serious concerns about his current health condition.

""We urgently request to hold negotiations and an urgent medical conсilium with the medical workers of the Medical Unit No. 33 to discuss the diagnostic tests carried out and the treatment to be prescribed, as well as to take the patient out of a critical condition threatening a fatal outcome,"" a copy of the letter shared by Vasilyeva said. ""We ask to be admitted to the examination of our patient, who has been observed for many years.""

Earlier this week, FSIN told CNN in a statement that Navalny was treated April 5-9 in a medical unit in penal colony No. 2 in Pokrov where he is imprisoned. The statement said Navalny was transferred back to his prison squad due to an ""improvement"" of his health condition.

Navalny said in a post on his official Instagram account on Friday that he is being threatened with force-feeding as he continues a hunger strike. Navalny said Friday that his blood test results show his health is deteriorating.

He has been diagnosed with two hernias and is losing feeling in both hands, one of his lawyers, Olga Mikhailova, said in an interview with Russian media last week

He is on a hunger strike in protest of prison officials refusing to grant him access to proper medical care. The Kremlin said this week that it would not give him special treatment.

CNN has put in a request with the Russian Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) for a statement on Navalny's health.

As President Joe Biden departed Wilmington Country Club in Delaware on Saturday, he was asked about Alexei Navalny's condition in prison. He told reporters that it's ""totally, totally unfair, totally inappropriate.""

Press secretary urges supporters to rally

Despite Navalny being imprisoned, his team have continued his work against corruption and organizing protest rallies in support of the opposition figure.

Kyra Yarmysh, Navalny's press secretary and assistant, is asking Navalny's supporters to join a rally that was meant to call for his freedom, but is now ""a condition for his life.""

Yarmysh said that ""now Alexey is dying. In his condition, it is a matter of days. And on weekends, lawyers simply cannot get to him, and no one knows what will happen on Monday.""

In a Facebook post , she said a rally is ""being prepared to demand the release of Alexey. And it will be huge too. But I don't want it to happen for other reasons.""

Yarmysh is under house arrest and does not have access to electronic devices. Her team said they published the post on her behalf. They said Yarmysh still has communication with her lawyers and can pass on some information and statements to be published.

There is no announced date for the rally. His team said they will announce a date for the rally when they reach 500,000 signatures.

On Thursday, FBK released a new investigation about an official residence used by Putin near Lake Valdai northwest of Moscow which they allege contains expensive interiors and a spa center not declared to Russian taxpayers. CNN cannot independently verify FBK's claims.

FBK released a widely viewed investigation in January into what they allege is a palace owned by Russian President Vladimir Putin by the Black Sea, estimated to be worth more than $1 billion. Putin has denied the palace belongs to him or his family members and close aides.

Russia has designated other groups 'extremist'

In 2017, Russia's Supreme Court banned Jehovah's Witnesses as an ""extremist organization."" Other groups that have been designated as ""extremist"" include far-right and Islamist organizations.

Navalny's organizations have faced pressure before from Russian authorities being subjected to raids and searched and in 2019, Russia's Justice Ministry designated FBK a ""foreign agent"" group.

""We know how to work in conditions of constant searches and frozen accounts, in conditions of administrative arrests and criminal cases. We have been building our political organization for ten years, have learned to survive under unthinkable pressure, change, be effective and win in the most impossible situations,"" Ivan Zhdanov, director of FBK, and Leonid Volkov, chief of staff for Navalny, said in a joint statement on Friday.

""It is clear that the Kremlin's new attack is linked to the upcoming rally and the elections in September. So it is clear what the answer should be: hold a rally (perhaps this is the last rally in the next few years), and win elections (perhaps this is the last election for many years to come),"" the statement continued.",1064,6599,13,95

NEW YORK (AP) — Safety regulators warned people with kids and pets Saturday to immediately stop using a treadmill made by Peloton after one child died and others were injured.

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said children and at least one pet were pulled, pinned and entrapped under the rear roller of the Tread+ treadmill, leading to fractures, scrapes and the death of one child.

The safety commission said in a news release and in emails that it knows of 39 “incidents” with the treadmill, involving “multiple” or “dozens” of children, but it did not specify a number of children. It said the majority of the incidents resulted in injuries, including the one death.

The commission posted a video on its YouTube page of a child being pulled under the treadmill.

Of the 39 incidents, 23 involved children, according to New York-based Peloton Interactive Inc.; 15 included objects like medicine balls, and one included a pet, it said.

Peloton said in a news release that the warning from the safety commission was “inaccurate and misleading.” It said there’s no reason to stop using the treadmill as long as children and pets are kept away from it at all times, it is turned off when not in use, and a safety key is removed.

But the safety commission said that in at least one episode, a child was pulled under the treadmill while a parent was running on it, suggesting it can be dangerous to children even while a parent is present.

If adults want to keep using the treadmill, the commission said, they should use it only in a locked room so children and pets can’t come near it. When not in use, the treadmill should be unplugged and the safety key taken out and hidden away. The commission also said to keep exercise balls and other objects away from it, because those have been pulled under the treadmill, too.

Peloton is best known for its stationary bikes, but it introduced the treadmill about three years ago and now calls it the Tread+. It costs more than $4,000.

Sales of Peloton equipment have soared during the pandemic as virus-weary people avoid gyms and workout at home instead. The company brought in $1 billion in revenue in the last three months of 2020, more than double its revenue from the same period a year before.

The commission did not say how many of the Peloton treadmills have been sold.

___

This story has been corrected to show that the Consumer Product Safety Commission said it recorded 39 incidents involving the treadmill, not nearly 40 children injured.

Now the third wave has hit Poland and the number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care stands at 17, with just four non-COVID sufferers. Around 80% of the COVID patients are expected to die.

Szlachcic-Wyroba, however, is still working with only three other doctors.

""We are physically doing our best but we are frequently unable to secure the care that we would like to provide,"" she said in the ward's break room for staff, lined with couches and a stray sleeping bag, adding that when on shift they often can't even take a break to sit down.

As COVID-related deaths in Poland surpass 800 a day and the country hits a European record for excess deaths, epidemiologists have pointed to a major medical personnel shortage as one of the culprits.

Szlachcic-Wyroba is exhausted from 24-hour shifts and comforting patients' families, adding that the flood of critically ill patients in recent weeks surpassed ""even my worst dreams"".

Across Poland, doctors have complained about long lines of ambulances at hospitals or rescheduled non-COVID surgeries for life-threatening illnesses.

""The country was unprepared for this scale of an epidemic... There are no beds, no personnel, simply no reserves,"" said professor Krzysztof Simon, a regional epidemiology consultant from Lower Silesia.

According to Eurostat, Poland had only 2.4 doctors and 5.1 nurses per 1,000 citizens in 2017, among the lowest in the EU, even before the pandemic.

Many doctors have gone abroad in search of better pay, with health spending not enough to attract or retain staff.

""The healthcare system is now at its limit but it has been at this limit basically for as long as I can remember. The epidemic has just multiplied all of its shortcomings,"" said Piotr Meryk, head doctor at the Zeromski hospital's COVID ward.

That means deaths have spiked this year, doctors say, as COVID patients are reluctant to go to hospital, fearing poor conditions and patients suffering from other serious illnesses are neglected by specialists relocated to COVID wards.

After Brazil, Poland had the second highest cumulative number of confirmed deaths in the world the week of April 13, according to Our World in Data.

SOLUTIONS?

The government has promised to address the issue, but staff are hard to find despite efforts to recruit medical students and Ukrainian doctors.

""You can buy equipment, build temporary hospitals, produce more beds, but personnel is the element that is creating a bottleneck,"" Health Minister Adam Niedzielski said in February.

In a statement to Reuters, the ministry said it had taken legislative steps in recent years to recruit more nurses and doctors.

But as patients flood wards, Meryk said these steps were not enough, and he urged the government to prepare for future pandemics.

""You can't just make these doctors appear or clone them.""

0,The man who made Fords great to drive has passed away,https://www.topgear.com/car-news/man-who-made-fords-great-drive-has-passed-away,"Richard Parry-Jones, the engineer responsible more than any other for the driving excellence of 21st-century Fords, has died aged 69.

The news has sent shockwaves round an industry where his influence had spread hugely. And where he wasn’t only admired but held in deep affection by everyone who knew him. He was killed in an accident on the farm in Wales where he’d retired.

Parry-Jones was a brilliant dynamics engineer, a superb communicator, a motorsports fan and an early advocate for the need for the car industry to reduce CO2. His working life is a demonstration of how one individual really can have an influence over this whole colossal industry.

The man known to all as RP-J was a Ford lifer, having joined as an apprentice. His first big hit was as chief engineer of the Mondeo, launched in 1992. This was a huge programme: Ford spent about £5bn (in 1995 money) on the Mondeo and its American equivalents the Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique.

Previous to that car, Ford’s engineering effort – and it was very well executed - was all about saving money. If in consequence the car’s ride was lumpy and the engine rough and the steering slack, well that was tough luck: they were profitable cars to manufacture and sell.

With the Mondeo, Parry-Jones shifted Ford’s course. He reckoned there would be more money to be made by building better cars that would sell in higher numbers at higher prices. He sweated every detail of the engineering in search of improvements in dynamics and refinement.

You’d be driving with him and he’d say things like, ‘see, we’ve changed the compliance in the steering rack bushes. The customer can feel it you know’. He was passionate, and a brilliant communicator.

It’s a rather awful irony that within weeks of Ford’s announcement that the Mondeo will be no more, we also lose the man that made it.

After that Mondeo, he led on the Fiesta, a vast improvement on what went before, and the lovely Puma coupe. Then the 1998 Focus, a radically designed and brilliant-driving hatch, night and day better than the Escort. All spawned wonderful hot versions too.

At that point he was promoted to Detroit to head all Ford’s engineering and design worldwide. He admitted to being pretty shocked at some of the US metal he had to deal with. Even the dominant F-150 pickup.

He was also in charge of engineering for all the vehicles under the FoMoCo umbrella, including, at the time, Jaguar Land Rover, Volvo, Mazda, Lincoln and Aston Martin. He returned to the board of Aston recently.

In his day, he’d been a very competitive rally driver. But he wasn’t just about cars going at maximum-hoon. (Though he was also about that; I among many others have had to ask him to stop a road car he was driving so I could get out and chunder.)

No, he mainly wanted his cars to be satisfying at ordinary speeds to ordinary drivers. The progression of the steering, the refinement of the ride, the brake feel at gentle stops. His cars just felt right, even to drivers who had no idea why.

He didn’t just operate by instinct. One of his great contributions was to develop a series of metrics, input-output graphs that could be recorded by sensors attached to prototypes. These fed into a digital model of what a Ford should feel like. This was propagated throughout the company to be used by engineers in multiple different places and times.

He was also a brilliant developer of talent, mentoring a generation of engineers inside the Ford Group. Others who worked for him went on to do great things elsewhere. Prominently, Uli Eichhorn worked with him on the Focus, and was recruited by VW. He made sure his Mk5 Golf got Focus-like suspension, before moving on to Bentley before becoming chief engineer of the whole VW Group.

So although RPJ retired in 2007, his influence reverberates across Ford, and in companies such as JLR and Volvo that are no longer part of Ford, and in companies entirely beyond Ford.

Actually, it basically went through the whole industry because nearly every European mainstream company had to polish its dynamics game to have a hope of keeping up with his late-90s cars.

He also pushed Ford’s motorsport involvement, and brought in Malcolm Wilson to make the WRC team a success at the turn of the century.

After he retired, he served on several important industry boards, and advised the UK and Welsh Governments on auto, energy and industrial policy. He was chair of Network Rail for three years, too.

In all of this, he was a strikingly insightful thinker and wonderfully expressive communicator, as well as stimulating company who’d always give you a new way of looking at something. And a witty bon viveur. He once called for a final round of drinks at an off-site event, to be told by the waiter, ‘sorry sir, we’re now serving breakfast’.

He will be greatly missed by so many in his beloved Wales and far beyond. To his family and friends we send our best wishes.",859,4933,11,53

Dr. Anthony Fauci on Sunday predicted that U.S. health regulators will end the temporary pause on distributing Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine, adding he expects a decision could come as soon as Friday.

""My estimate is that we will continue to use it in some form. I doubt very seriously if they just cancel it. I don't think that's going to happen. I do think that there will likely be some sort of warning or restriction or risk assessment,"" Fauci said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

U.S. health regulators recommended last week that use of the J&J vaccine be paused after reports of six cases of rare brain blood clots in women, out of some 7 million people who have received the shot in the United States.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advisory panel is set to meet on April 23 to discuss the next steps for the vaccine.

Fauci said he does not know what the final decision will be, but he predicts there will be a resumption.

""I don't know if there have been further cases. We will know that by Friday, and I would be very surprised ... if we don't have a resumption in some form by Friday. A decision almost certainly will be made by Friday,"" Fauci said on CBS' ""Face the Nation.""

Fauci on Sunday also laid out a possible timeline for when children could be vaccinated against COVID-19.

""I would be surprised if we didn't have the high school kids being able to be vaccinated by the fall term,"" he told CBS. ""I think by the time we get to the first quarter of 2022, we will be able to vaccinate children of virtually any age - hopefully before then,"" he added.

""But I think that's going to be the latest we'll see it.""

My friends, everybody has their down days, and during these long winter months it is especially easy to succumb to the doldrums and find yourself in a bit of a funk. But not to fear! I have a simple tip that’s guaranteed to pick you up and get you back in good spirits in no time, and here it is: Whenever you’re feeling low, just remember that I, Donald Trump, will be dead in roughly 15 to 20 years.

Advertisement

That’s right. In the not-very-distant future I will die and then be gone from the world for all eternity. You may even get to watch me in a casket on national television being lowered into the ground, never to be seen again. I bet you’re smiling just thinking about that.

Now, I recognize that the news out there in the world has been particularly depressing lately, and these days it’s understandable that one might begin to feel like there’s no hope and no reason to go on, but let me assure you that there is. Oh, boy, is there ever! Indeed, you can always take solace in the fact that the monstrous, unimaginable piece of shit that is me will stop existing fairly soon, and that I will continue to not exist for the remainder of your lifetime. Biologically speaking, I, the host of NBC’s The Apprentice and Celebrity Apprentice, have no more than two decades left to live. In fact, right now I’m just 10 years away from reaching the average lifespan of an American male.

How does that make you feel? Pretty good, right?

Sure, I’ll have a grand, opulent funeral that will be talked about and broadcast extensively, and all the news segment retrospectives on my life will probably be obnoxious to watch and listen to, and will very likely make you angry. But just think: all of those segments will end with a picture of my blustery, self-important face and the dates 1946–2031 printed beneath it. Or maybe 1946–2032. Or, who knows, maybe earlier! Even if you’re not feeling glum, I guarantee the recognition that my death is a concrete and rapidly approaching inevitability will make you feel even better.

And if my death in 15 or 20 years feels like it’s too far in the future to wash away your blues, you can take heart knowing that I’ll start to physically and mentally deteriorate well before then. Why, by 2020, I, a man who recently tried to extort the sitting president of the United States to release his college and passport records, might even begin to show signs of serious and unavoidable decline in mental and physical faculties, and doesn’t that just perk your spirits right up? Just imagine me shuffling along, hunched forward, with a noticeably shortened gait and perpetually haggard face. Heck, that might happen by the end of this decade! Of course there’s an outside chance I could make it another 25 years, but in a way, wouldn’t it be even more uplifting and enjoyable for everyone if I wasted away slowly and pitifully until I became a wizened and impossibly frail old relic—the pathetically impotent, papery husk of a once-powerful man?

Hey, I’ve got an idea! Let’s try a surefire pick-me-up that is certain to buoy your spirits right this very moment: let’s think of ways I could die! Perhaps I’ll suffer through a slow, excruciating kidney failure that leaves me in profound pain that the doctors just can’t treat. It could be a massive heart attack while I’m delivering a speech to investors, forcing me to clutch my chest in agony and stagger into the audience. It could be Alzheimer’s. Or I could even be diagnosed with a vicious form of cancer that at first appears to be responding well to chemotherapy but then takes a rapid and inescapable turn for the worse.

Advertisement

And of course there’s always the possibility that I’ll be declared brain-dead after a stroke and lie immobile on a hospital bed for a year or more before Melania finally works up the courage to pull the plug.

And if you need a real shot in the arm to get you laughing and smiling again, just remember that I could trip down a flight of stairs in my own ultra-plush luxury high-rise this very night and shatter my skull right there. Isn’t that great?

So there’s no reason to be wearing a frown, my friend. I will die, and I will die soon. And as long as you remember that, your days will be brighter. I promise.",764,4276,15,75

Hester McCardell Ford was born Aug. 15, 1905, in Lancaster County, South Carolina, according to the Gerontology Research Group. Some U.S. census records place her birth year as 1904. She became the oldest person in the United States when Alelia Murphy died on Nov. 23, 2019, at the age of 114.

She had lived in the Charlotte area since the 1950s, WSOC-TV reported.

“She was a pillar and stalwart to our family and provided much-needed love, support and understanding to us all,” Ford’s great-granddaughter, Tanisha Patterson-Powe, posted on Facebook. “She was the seed that sprouted leaves and branches which is now our family. God saw fit to make her the matriarch of your family and blessed us to be her caretakers and recipients of her legacy.”

Ford’s father was a farmer in South Carolina. She grew up picking cotton, plowing fields and canning vegetables before moving to Charlotte, WSOC reported.

She was married to John Ford in South Carolina on March 12, 1921. They raised a family in Pleasant Hill, South Carolina, before moving to Charlotte. John Ford died Jan. 10, 1963, in Charlotte, according to vital records.

Hester Ford had 12 children, 48 grandchildren, 108 great-grandchildren, and approximately 120 great-great-grandchildren.

“Although she has passed, her legacy and memory will continue to live on through her family and everyone she has touched to make the world a better place for generations to come,” the family’s Facebook post read. “In closing, we would sincerely like to thank everyone for their support, extended gratitude as we keep her legacy alive. As we pause from our day-to-day activities let us reflect on how far we have come and where we are aspiring to go in the name and legacy of Mother Hester McCardell Ford.”

Ford’s death makes Thelma Sutcliffe, of Nebraska, who was born Oct. 1, 1906, as the nation’s oldest living person, according to the Gerontology Research Group.

Hester Ford was a longtime member of Macedonia Baptist Church. Sept. 1, 2020, was designated as Mother Hester McCardell Ford Day by the Mecklenburg County Board of Commissioners, WSOC reported.

Beijing blanketed Hong Kong in a sweeping national security law last year in response to months of huge and often violent democracy protests that convulsed the international business hub.

Thursday’s education day, the first since the security law’s imposition last June, saw activities held across the city that burnished the security forces and outlined the threats China perceives it faces in Hong Kong.

At a morning ceremony attended by senior officials, Luo Huining, Beijing’s top envoy in Hong Kong, gave a fiery speech vowing to “strike down hard resistance and regulate soft resistance”, warning that China was ready to “teach a lesson” to any foreign power trying to use the city “as a chess piece”.

“For all deeds that endanger national security and Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability, the central authorities will take action as necessary,” he said.

In 2019, huge crowds hit the streets for seven straight months demanding democracy and greater police accountability in the worst unrest since the city’s 1997 handover to China.

Beijing’s authoritarian leaders have dismissed the movement, portraying it as an insidious “foreign plot” to destroy China.

They have since embarked on a crackdown against critics and rolled out an official campaign — dubbed “staunch patriots governing Hong Kong” — to root out disloyalty towards the Chinese Communist Party.

Across town on Thursday, Hong Kong’s police college held an open day in which officers revealed a new goose-step march, the same style used by police and troops on the Chinese mainland.

The display was a symbolic break from Hong Kong’s British colonial past and Chinese army officers helped train police in the new style.

Tactical units then held an “anti-terrorism drill” which included officers rappelling from a helicopter to shoot dead pretend armed militants and a hostage-taker.

On the sidelines, guests wearing “I love police” t-shirts posed for selfies with a bear mascot dressed in tactical uniform.

Cuddly toy versions of the bear were also on sale for HK$400 ($52) alongside plastic toys of police officers holding tear gas warning flags.

Schools have been a major focus for authorities as they seek to incubate loyalty from an early age and national security day activities were held across classrooms featuring “games and puzzles”.

Education authorities have already ordered children as young as six to be taught about the four new national security crimes — subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.

The Correctional Services Department also held open days where guests could don a virtual reality headset to experience what it is like to be a prison guard.

More than 10,000 people were arrested during pro-democracy protests and more than 2,500 charged.

Over 100 people have also been arrested under the new security law, mostly pro-democracy politicians and opposition figures.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Orvil Samuel/AP Orvil Samuel/AP

The volcano La Soufrière began to explosively erupt on the Caribbean island of St. Vincent last Friday. For nearly a week, periodic eruptions have covered the island in ash and volcanic flows of molten rock and gas have gushed down the mountainside. Residents have been displaced and are left without clean water or electricity, adding a humanitarian emergency into the mix.

La Soufrière's eruption forced approximately 30 villages on the northern portion of the island to evacuate. A report by the World Health Organization and The Pan American Health Organization said 16,000 to 20,000 people are affected. More than 4,000 people are occupying 89 public shelters. Two thousand others confirmed they are staying with friends or family.

Despite mandatory evacuation orders by Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves early last week, 127 people were rescued from Owia, a town on the northeastern side of the island and well within the volcano's danger zone.

The United States has been working to get Americans off the island. In collaboration with Royal Caribbean Cruises, the U.S. Embassy will transport American citizens from St. Vincent to Dutch Sint Maarten Friday free of charge.

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported Monday that the volcano's eruption has left the entire population of St. Vincent, 110,000 people, without clean drinking water or electricity. Access to St. Vincent and the Grenadines has been restricted since the eruption began. Airports are shut down and maritime travel is limited, hindering support efforts.

The biggest issue is clean water, U.N. Resident Coordinator for Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean Didier Trebucq said in a briefing Wednesday. The water system has been shut down so any drinking water is coming from outside the country. ""We are facing a situation with a great deal of uncertainty and also a humanitarian crisis that is growing and may continue for weeks and months,"" he said.

The U.N. said it has pre-positioned water and hygiene supplies, in nearby Barbados, including 60,000 masks and medical gowns. Additionally, PAHO will purchase 50 water tanks and pumps, chlorine testing kits and other necessities for health clinics.

The dome of the volcano has been completely destroyed during the periodic eruptions. More than 460 million cubic tons of rock and earth has been propelled into the atmosphere. Winds have carried the ash to neighboring islands of Barbados, Grenada and Saint Lucia.

Experts predict La Soufrière will continue to erupt. The University of the West Indies Seismic Research Centre said explosions and ashfall are expected to continue over the next few days. The volcano is showing a pattern of episodic explosions with long pauses. The UWI expects more explosions of similar or larger magnitude.

Pyroclastic flows continue to threaten the areas immediately surrounding the volcano. These flows of super-heated gas, rock and debris shoot down the face of the mountain, destroying everything in their path. They also move at incredible speeds, averaging 60 mph, but capable of reaching speeds of over 400 mph. These flows appear to have traveled along valleys on the Eastern side of the island toward the Rabacca River. However, these pyroclastic currents can take place anywhere in the immediate area of the volcano.

Trebucq said the crisis on St. Vincent will not be short lived. Even when the volcano stops erupting, which could be weeks from now, he expects the challenges to last more than six months. ""In reality, 100% of the population is indirectly affected by the situation,"" Trebucq said. The U.N. will ask for funding appeal to help support St. Vincent and the Grenadines in the coming months.",610,3836,9,57

For decades, Nepal’s endangered rhino population has dwindled to near extinction. But recently, thanks in part to travel restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic, the population has soared.

The nation’s count of endangered one-horned rhinoceros has increased by more than 100 over the past six years. Officials are hailing the rise a “conservation milestone.”

The rhino population across four national parks in the southern plains rose to 752 — up from 645 in 2015, according to the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation. That’s the highest it’s been in decades.

“The increase of rhinos is exciting news for us,” the department’s information officer, Haribhadra Acharya, said in a statement. “But we have challenges ahead to expand the habitat areas of this animal to maintain the growth.”

The area was once dominated by thousands of one-horned rhinos, but rampant poaching and habitat loss reduced their numbers. In the 1960s, there were only about 100 left.

Nepal has conducted a rhino census every five years since 1994 in an effort to conserve the species after it was listed as vulnerable. That year, the Himalayan nation recorded 466 rhinos.

Ever since, the government has stepped up its anti-poaching and conservation initiatives. But this year, the lack of tourists in the country left the habitats undisturbed, allowing for even more growth.

“Due to the COVID-19 lockdown, the tourist pressure was reduced drastically that resulted in the undisturbed habitat of rhinos,” Acharya told CBS News on Thursday. “In that scenario, the wildlife recovery might have taken momentum.”

Last month, hundreds of enumerators, soldiers and veterinarians worked for about three weeks to count this year’s rhino population. The census was delayed a year due to the pandemic.

They counted the rhinos using GPS equipment, binoculars and cameras — what they call a “direct observation method.” Officials said they got as close to 330 feet away from the animals.

The World Wildlife Fund, which helps fund and assist the census efforts, called the increase a “milestone” for the country.

“The overall growth in population size is indicative of ongoing protection and habitat management efforts by protected area authorities despite challenging contexts these past years,” the WWF’s Nepal representative, Ghana Gurung, said in a statement. “This achievement is yet another milestone in Nepal’s conservation journey showcasing the impact of concerted efforts of all stakeholders and providing much0needed impetus to the global conservation fraternity.”

Illegal poaching remains a massive threat to the rhino population due to the illegal trade of horns. Many countries prize the horns for their supposed medicinal properties, which are unproven.

Approximately 26 rhinos in Nepal died last year, including four from poaching, officials said.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List still lists the animal as vulnerable, with fewer than 2,200 left in India and Nepal. The species is already extinct in Bangladesh, Bhutan and Pakistan.

1,Federal Prisons Reinstitute Executions By Lethal Inflation,https://www.theonion.com/federal-prisons-reinstitute-executions-by-lethal-inflat-1844650388,"WASHINGTON—After the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in favor of the method being used on death-row inmates, federal prisons reinstituted executions by lethal inflation, sources confirmed Wednesday. “Pumping air into the prisoner until they swell up and burst into a cloud of bone and viscera is clearly a lawful and humane way to execute inmates,” said Federal Bureau of Prisons director Michael Carvajal, adding that while some critics of the death penalty oppose lethal inflation as cruel and unusual punishment, the rapid injection of a cocktail of noble gasses into an inmate ensured that their eyes popped out of their head within minutes. “While there are very occasional mishaps, such as an inmate not being tied down and thus floating away, lethal inflation goes off without a hitch in well over 95% of cases. The inmate experiences only mild discomfort for a few short seconds while the pressure creates pockets of air under their skin—unless of course the executioner is using a hand pump, in which case it may be a few minutes before the prisoner is sufficiently inflated enough to rupture.” Federal officials added that despite the potential risks, it was a much more merciful method than lethal implosion.

The EU is chairing meetings in Vienna of the remaining parties to the deal - Iran, Russia, China, France, Germany and Britain. A delegation from the United States, which pulled out of the accord under President Donald Trump, is based in a nearby hotel as Iran has refused to hold direct talks.

A second round of talks, which involve discussions in various formats as well as formal meetings of all the remaining parties, started on Thursday. The aim is a U.S. return to the deal, lifting sanctions that were reimposed after its pullout, and undoing Iranian breaches of its nuclear restrictions. read more

Talks will continue ""for a few days and then I think the two most relevant delegations will go back home to receive more precise instructions and then, I don't know when, we will resume,"" the EU official told reporters in a phone briefing.

The talks have been overshadowed by an explosion at Iran's main uranium-enrichment facility at Natanz, which Tehran has blamed on Israel, and Iran's decision to enrich uranium to 60% purity, a big step towards weapons-grade, which it said it started doing on Friday. read more

""We have this (Iranian) decision to go for 60% enrichment. Obviously this is not making the negotiation easier,"" the official said, calling what happened at Natanz ""deliberate sabotage"". It is not clear how long the talks will last in total, he added.

Israel - widely believed to be the only Middle Eastern country with a nuclear arsenal - has not formally commented on the Natanz incident. Several Israeli media outlets have quoted intelligence sources as saying the country's Mossad spy service carried out the operation.

The big picture: Production continues to ramp up quickly. While it took several months to reach one billion doses, we should hit two billion by the end of May, according to data from Airfinity, a science information and analytics company.

China is the biggest producer and easily the biggest exporter, particularly now that India is curbing exports to fight a brutal second wave.

Russia, Switzerland, South Korea, Brazil and South Africa are all producing doses but lag behind the five producers on our chart.

The U.S. has kept nearly all of its supply for domestic use, but expects to become a major exporter once domestic needs are met. The White House has offered few details on that front, though, beyond saying a framework for dose-sharing is in the works.

0,French MPs pass controversial law that restricts images of police,https://www.euronews.com/2021/04/15/french-mps-pass-controversial-law-that-would-restrict-images-of-police,"French lawmakers have given their final support for a controversial ""global security"" law which has sparked widespread demonstrations.

The bill is centred on ""Article 24"", which will make it an offence to maliciously share images that identify police officers in operation by face or name.

Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said the law would protect police officers from online calls for violence. Police unions have also expressed their support for the measures.

But the legislation has been widely criticised by both humans rights and media organisations who say that it would curtail press freedom and lead to less police accountability.

Thousands of French citizens had demonstrated against the original bill and increased incidents of police violence at nationwide rallies in November.

The rallies prompted the French government to announce a ""complete new rewrite"" of the contested article, which had originally been approved by the country's Senate.

Under Article 24, it will be an offence to disseminate images of national police officers or gendarmes if there is intention or ""provocation"" to identify them.

Any shared videos with malicious intent to identify the spouse, partner, or child of a police or customs officer will also be punished.

Those found guilty could face a sentence of up to five years in prison and a €75,000 fine.

This has been increased from the original legislation, which carried a sentence of one year and a €45,000 fine.

The law states that an offending person must have ""the obvious aim of damaging the physical or psychological integrity"" of the police officer in question.

But the provisions have still faced opposition from NGOs including Reporters without Borders (RSF) and Amnesty International France, who were among those that encouraged people to go to the protests.

""This law sets up a broad surveillance of the French population, including by drones,"" said Anne-Sophie Simpere, advocacy officer for Amnesty International France, referring to another provision of the new law, which allows authorities to use drones to monitor crowds of demonstrators.

""It's a threat to the right to privacy, but also to the right to protest. Many people don't want to be filmed and recorded by the state when they go to a protest, so this will have a deterrent effect on demonstrations,"" Simpere told Euronews.

""The whole logic of the legislation is against human rights law, which is supposed to protect the population against the abusive state and to protect the right to privacy, the right to freedom of expression and the right to inform,"" she said.

'Slippery measure'

Journalists have particularly expressed concern that they are endangered by filming police officers during their work at protests.

Pauline Adès-Mével, editors-in-chief of RSF, told Euronews in December that the “intent to harm” provision was still a “slippery measure”.

""We totally understand what the police is expecting and we do understand that police need to be protected, but the burden is currently on press freedom and journalists,"" she added.

""We need some measures that allow journalists to do their job on the field without being prevented from going live, or to be thought of as having an intention to harm.""

France’s National Consultative Commission on Human Rights has stated that the government has never intended to undermine press freedom with the bill.

Organisers of the demonstrations against the law last year said 500,000 people gathered, while the government estimated there had been 133,000 people present.

Dozens of police officers were injured at the rallies, which took place despite a national lockdown imposed to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The European Union has reminded France that journalists must be able to ""work freely and in full security"", warning that it would examine the country's controversial security bill to ensure it complies with EU laws.

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights office and France’s own human rights ombudsman have also said the new article risks undermining fundamental rights.

The bill was adopted by 75 members of the French National Assembly on Thursday, where President Emmanuel Macron's LREM party has a majority. Just 33 MPs voted against the bill, while 55 abstained.

The law will now have to be approved by France's Constitutional Court before coming into effect.",694,4378,10,65

0,Scientists Develop New Implantable Device to Measure Tissues' Oxygen,https://english.aawsat.com/home/article/2923796/scientists-develop-new-implantable-device-measure-tissues-oxygen,"Cairo - Hazem Badr

Engineers at the University of California (UC) have created a tiny 4.5×3 mm device that can be implanted inside the body to provide real-time measurements of tissues' oxygen, and monitor the measurements wirelessly.

The device, which is powered by ultrasound waves, could help doctors monitor the health of transplanted organs or tissue and provide an early warning of potential transplant failure. The new development was announced in the journal Nature Biotechnology on April 14.

The technology also paves the way for the creation of a variety of miniaturized sensors that could track other key biochemical markers in the body, such as pH or carbon dioxide. These sensors could one day provide doctors with minimally invasive methods for monitoring the biochemistry inside functioning organs and tissues.

""It's very difficult to measure things deep inside the body. This new device can go very deep into tissue to take data from organs,"" said Michel Maharbiz, a UC professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences, in a report published on the university's website.

Oxygen is a key component to cells' ability to harness energy from the food that we eat, and nearly all tissues in the body require a steady supply in order to survive.

Most methods for measuring tissue oxygenation can only provide information about what is happening near the surface of the body. That is because these methods rely on electromagnetic waves, such as infrared light, which can only penetrate a few centimeters into skin or organ tissue. While there are types of magnetic resonance imaging that can provide information about deep tissue oxygenation, they require long scanning times, and so are unable to provide data in real time.

Maharbiz points out that this type of oxygen sensor differs from the pulse oximeters that are used to measure oxygen saturation in the blood.

While pulse oximeters measure the proportion of hemoglobin in the blood that is oxygenated, the new device is able to directly measure the amount of oxygen in tissue.",333,2059,9,68

Hawaii News Now identified the victim as Lindani Myeni, 29, from eSikhawini in northern KwaZulu-Natal.

According to media reports, officers from the Honolulu Police Department (HPD) were forced to use lethal force when Myeni allegedly attacked them, injuring three of their officers, just after 8pm on Wednesday night.

HPD police chief Susan Ballard told local media that police had responded to a “robbery in progress” at a Nuuanu home after Myeni entered and began chatting with the homeowners, who were upset that he had come inside.

Myeni left shortly afterwards and sat in his vehicle before police arrived.

However, Ballard was unable to answer if Myeni had actually taken anything from the home which would substantiate the reason for labelling it a robbery.

She said officers had tried to use non-lethal force first, which included deploying a Taser, before they fired four shots, fatally wounding Myeni.

According to Ballard the first officer on scene was in a stable condition but had sustained multiple facial fractures and a concussion after the alleged attack.",202,1250,10,54

Using satellite and drone footage, company records, photographs and other data, investigators have released floor plans and some of the first photographs of an expanded residence near Valdai, which they said was the Russian president’s favourite and most secret.

They claimed the residence was partly leased from one of Putin’s closest allies on taxpayer money. While some of the lakeside property is state-owned and designated for official use, a more lavish section with a mansion has been privately developed into what has been described as a playground for the health-conscious head of state.

In particular, the investigation focuses on a 7,000 sq metre (75,000 sq ft) spa complex whose floor plans show a float pool, massage rooms, a swimming pool, and other amenities, such as an extreme-cold treatment cryotherapy chamber, that are rented from a company alleged to belong to one of Putin’s close friends.

Company statements showed that the owner of the complex has made more than 2.7bn roubles (£25.8m) in the past decade.

The investigation was released as Navalny remains on hunger strike in a Russian prison and his supporters are being pressurised by the government not to continue protests against his two-and-a-half year sentence on embezzlement charges.

The emails of more than 500,000 Navalny supporters, many of whom had signed up online to attend new protests against the Kremlin, was leaked to journalists this week by an anonymous group that called the Navalny team “losers” and claimed the database was heavily populated with bots.

Navalny’s team confirmed that the leaked database was real, but did not say if any of the emails were run by automated accounts. It apologised to those on the list, saying the leak contained only emails and no other personal information. The leak came as Navalny’s team is closing in on collecting 500,000 online signatures in order to launch new protests calling for the opposition leader’s freedom.

“[The database] is real as opposed to the fakes that were released earlier,” wrote Ivan Zhdanov, the director of the group. “It’s happening now, when the campaign needs just 70,000 more signatures and every confirmation to attend the protests is much harder for us to collect.”

In a message posted online on Friday Navalny said that he was being threatened with being force-fed in a straitjacket unless he ended a hunger strike in protest against his treatment in a Russian prison. He has demanded to be seen by his doctor for reported numbness in his back and legs, which he says may be linked to the poisoning attempt on his life that took place last year.

His wife earlier this week said he looked gaunt during his meeting with her and he had lost an estimated 16kg since arriving at a prison colony about 60 miles east of Moscow last month.

“He is still as cheerful and upbeat as ever,” Yulia Navalnaya wrote in an online post on Wednesday. “He speaks with difficulty, though, and from time to time he hangs up the phone and leans on the table to take a break. He has lost a lot of weight … and weighs 76kg.”

01:32 Alexei Navalny releases investigation into Vladimir Putin’s wealth – video

Some of the anger at the Kremlin has been sparked by a previous investigation into a Black Sea dacha that was said to cost nearly £1bn and to have been established for the special use of the president, although recent photographs suggest that it was no longer in use. That residence included flourishes such as an “aqua-disco” and a wine cave dug into a cliff overlooking the Black Sea.

The investigation into that residence, which has been called Putin’s Palace, came after Navalny’s arrest upon returning to Russia in January and showed that the opposition leader remained a danger to the Kremlin even while behind bars.

The authors of the new investigation concluded it with a call for his freedom. “Putin illegally imprisoned Navalny for telling the truth about his corruption, lies, and duplicity. We will continue to tell this truth.”",706,4253,25,170

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan blocked access to all social media on Friday, after days of anti-French protests across the country by radical Islamists opposed to cartoons they consider blasphemous.

Sites temporarily blocked on orders from the country's interior ministry included Twitter and Facebook, said Khurram Mehran, a spokesman for Pakistan's media regulatory agency. He gave no further details.

The move comes as police officials prepare to clear a large demonstration in the eastern city of Lahore, and just hours after the government said the leader of the outlawed Islamist political party at the forefront of the protests had urged his supporters to stand down.

By releasing a note they say was handwritten by Saad Rizvi, the government hopes to calm tensions after his Tehreek-e-Labiak Pakistan party stirred up the violent protests, in which two police officers were killed and 580 injured. France urged its citizens to leave the country as a result.

Three demonstrators also died in the clashes with security agencies, and the government has imposed a ban on the party.

A photo of the statement was released earlier by an advisor to the prime minister on Twitter, but neither Rizvi himself or any of his party leadership was immediately available for comment. Some of his followers insisted they hear or see the words come from Rizvi himself before stopping, and the Lahore protest continued after Friday prayers.

On Thursday, the French embassy in Pakistan advised all of its nationals and companies to temporarily leave the Islamic country, after violence erupted over Rizvi's arrest.

Violent protests have been going on in Lahore since Monday, damaging private and public property and disrupting the much-need supply of oxygen to hospitals. Some of the affected included COVID-19 patients, who were on oxygen support.

In the statement, Rizvi asked his supporters to peacefully disperse for the good of the country and end their main sit-in that began Monday, when police arrested the radical cleric for threatening protests if the government did not expel the French ambassador before April 20.

Rizvi's arrest sparked violent protests by his followers, who disrupted traffic by staging sit-ins across the country. Although security forces cleared almost all of the rallies, thousands of Rizvi's followers are still assembled in Lahore, vowing to die in order to protect the honor of Islam's Prophet Muhammad.

Rizvi became the leader of the outlawed Tehreek-e-Labiak Pakistan party in November after the sudden death of his father, Khadim Hussein Rizvi. His party also wants the government to boycott French products.

Rizvi's outlawed party has denounced French President Emmanuel Macron since October last year, saying he tried to defend blasphemous caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad as freedom of expression. Macron had spoken after a young Muslim beheaded a French school teacher who had shown caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad in class.

The images had been republished by the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo to mark the opening of the trial over the deadly 2015 attack against the publication for the original caricatures.

That enraged many Muslims in Pakistan and elsewhere who believe those depictions were blasphemous. Rizvi's group in recent years became known for opposing any change to the country's harsh blasphemy laws, under which anyone accused of insulting Islam or other religious figures can be sentenced to death if found guilty.

Denying the Holocaust is an illegal offense in several European countries — including Germany and France — and offenders can be sent to prison.

Khan wants to see governments take an equally harsh position on those who blaspheme against the Prophet Muhammad.

""I ... call on Western governments who have outlawed any negative comment on the holocaust to use the same standards to penalise those deliberately spreading their message of hate against Muslims by abusing our Prophet,"" Khan tweeted.

""We Muslims have the greatest love & respect for our Prophet,"" he continued. ""We cannot tolerate any such disrespect & abuse.""

Anti-French government protests

The comparison comes after a week of violent protests across Pakistan by a radical Islamist party outraged by French government support for the publication of cartoons depicting Muhammad.

Tehreek-e-Labiak Pakistan (TLP) was subsequently banned after the unrest saw four police officers killed.

Khan suggested the government had not put a stop to the TLP because it disagreed with the party's sentiments, but rather its way of expressing them.

""Let me make clear to people here & abroad: Our government only took action against TLP under our anti-terrorist law when they challenged the writ of the state and used street violence & attacking the public and law enforcers,"" he said.

""No one can be above the law and the Constitution.""

Calls to leave Pakistan fall on deaf ears

The extremist party has orchestrated a monthslong campaign calling for the expulsion of the French ambassador after President Emmanuel Macron defended the right for magazines to publish images of Prophet Muhammad. The TLP and a number of prominent Muslims have deemed the cartoons offensive.

The French Embassy in the Pakistani capital of Islamabad has recommended its nationals leave the country, a call that has so far gone largely unheeded.

Coke Whore

I'll bet a day doesn't go by that I don't hear something negative about crack cocaine, and the people who love it. Well, it just so happens that, despite all the mudslinging you may have read in the magazines, there are plenty of decent, hardworking crack lovers, just like in any other ""walk of life.""

Advertisement

Just because someone is desperately addicted to an incredibly intense form of refined cocaine doesn't mean they've forgotten about those old-fashioned values like thrift, cooperation and helping each other out. People always describe crack houses as someplace they wouldn't want to be. Well, the truth of the matter is that I wouldn't want to live anywhere where the people aren't working together. And that was exactly the key to turning our crack house into a crack home!

Just like a good drug needs to be cut in just the right proportions, an honest-to-goodness crack home needs the right mix of people, each with their own special qualities, but who are willing to be ""team players"" to achieve their shared goal of constantly staying high on a really expensive drug. Crack doesn't grow on trees, you know!

A home needs whores, shakedown boys, thieves, muggers, scam artists—a whole range of diverse people with unique attributes. Cooperation: That's the difference between a bunch of shivering people hitting the pipe in the same abandoned building, and a real family sharing a home.

We have a chart on the refrigerator to remind everyone of their duties, and we rotate the chores on a regular basis to make it fair. No one likes to get fucked in the ass by strangers every day for a week straight, do they? No, so we switch the chores so that today it's prostitution, but tomorrow it might be liquor-store hold-ups or muggings. I add colorful stickers and glitter to our duty chart, but you can personalize yours anyway you want, maybe by cutting pictures out of old magazines or using bright fuzzy yarn to string up the amputated fingers of suppliers who have passed you bad rock.

We're one big family in our crack home because we recognize the uniqueness of each and every individual addict. (Not everyone is good at everything, but everyone is good at something!) We keep the lines of communication open and remember to listen so everyone has a friend to turn to. Sure, we may poke fun when the maggots covering the piles of garbage find their way into the gaping sores all over Eddie's body that never seem to heal—but we'd never kick him out of the room just because we don't want to look at him.

Maybe someday our crack home will even have a till jar for bus rides to the free clinic. Then, hopefully, Yolanda will never again have to throw herself off the fire escape and crawl back upstairs to have a miscarriage on the kitchen floor.

Another big part of turning a crack house into a crack home is respect for everyone. Dr. Maxwell McFarland, author of Wake up and Live, reminds us that everything alive on this earth is dependent on something else. No one is a loner! I need you and you need me! If the pick-up doesn't come through and I start shaking so bad that I vomit, and someone else needs to vomit too, I'll share the cardboard box. If DeeDee has gone catatonic and hasn't shut her eyes since yesterday, none of us knock her over just for fun.

And if anyone should overdose or get shot or even just suddenly find a torrent of blood streaming from their nostrils and then choke to death on mouthfuls of black-red mucus, we all help carry the body over into the neighbor's yard. Like I said, it's about mutual respect. And if the body lays in the yard too long and stuff starts to eat it, we'll throw something over it.

I've been told it takes a whole village to raise a child and I believe it, so if Lisa's baby works her way free, I'll do my part to make sure she doesn't crawl out the window again.

Last but not least, there's no squabbling and rowing allowed in a good home. I even made a big sign that said ""Words can hurt… Think before you speak!"" and I hung it where everyone would see it—right over the big metal trash can that everyone defecates into now that the broken toilet fell through the urine-soaked floor. Almost everyone abides by the no-fighting rule, but if a conflict comes up, we have a house meeting and every one of us gets a vote. (Everyone, great or small, counts!) Then whoever is on ""Judge"" duty on the chore chart takes the person deemed at fault, and kills that person.

Sure, not all of us are as good at certain tasks as another person might be, but that doesn't matter, as long as everyone tries their best. Remember, the only way to be a winner is to first be a beginner! When you're trying to win one for the home team, 100 percent participation from every member is key. Anything less and Custard will shoot your arms off at the shoulder at close range.

The things I've told you about are all common sense. I was a Home Economics teacher for 31 years before I got hooked on crack and sold my Taurus station wagon, converting the cash into bags of pure snow. But I don't have any tricks up my sleeve, just a wish to see everyone reach their potential!

Surprisingly, when I moved into our little windowless abode, the homies were somewhat reluctant to make any changes at first. But after I knitted everyone a sweater—to combat the shakes—and got Custard on my side by becoming his bitch, everyone else followed right along.

0,UN: 40 civilian casualties in central Yemen in March alone,https://www.thestar.com/news/world/middleeast/2021/04/16/un-40-civilian-casualties-in-central-yemen-in-march-alone.html,"CAIRO - The ongoing battle between Yemen’s Houthi rebels and government forces in the central province of Marib has caused 40 civilian casualties in March alone, the U.N. refugee agency said Friday.

At least 70 incidents of armed violence including shelling, crossfire, and air strikes have caused injuries and deaths among civilians during the first quarter of 2021, said the UNHCR in a statement. The UNHCR did not provide the breakdown of the killed and wounded but said that the tally was the highest in the oil-rich province since 2018.

Since February, Iran-backed Houthi rebels have been pushing to capture the province from the internationally recognized government to try to complete their control over the northern half of Yemen. If they succeed, the Houthis could claim a strategic win after a largely stalemated battle in almost seven years of fighting.

Among the civilian casualties were 13 people residing in makeshift settlements for displaced families, added the UNHCR.

The escalation in violence has so far displaced over 13,600 Yemenis in Marib, which already hosts a nearly one million of Yemen’s internally displaced people, said the statement. Almost 80 per cent of the newly-displaced are women and children who live in extreme poverty, said the UNHCR.

“UNHCR is renewing its call on all parties to the conflict to take measures to protect civilians, as well as civilian infrastructure, including sites hosting the displaced,” read the statement.

The UNHCR pleaded for urgent support from the international community to alleviate “the desperate situation” of the displaced Yemenis, deploring the decline in funding allocated to humanitarian efforts in the Arab world’s poorest country.

Yemen has been convulsed by civil war since 2014 when the Houthis took control of the capital of Sanaa and much of the northern part of the country, forcing the government of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi to flee to the south, then to Saudi Arabia.

The Saudi-led coalition, backed at the time by the U.S., entered the war months later to try restore Hadi to power. Despite a relentless air campaign and ground fighting, the war has deteriorated into a stalemate, killing about 130,000 people and spawning the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. The Biden administration last month officially withdrew its backing for the coalition but said the U.S. would continue to offer support to Saudi Arabia as it defends itself against Houthi attacks.

The Saudis have recently offered a ceasefire deal, but Houthis turned them down.

The French parliament on Thursday adopted legislation that characterises sex with a child under the age of 15 as rape and punishable by up to 20 years in jail, bringing its penal code closer in line with many other Western nations.

Sex between an adult and a child younger than 15 was already illegal but could only be prosecuted as rape if there was proof the minor was coerced through violence, constraint or surprise. Without proof of coercion, it was prosecuted as the lesser offence of a 'sexual act on a minor'

""This is an historic law for our children and our society,"" Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti told the National Assembly.

""No adult aggressor will be able to claim the consent of a minor younger than 15-years-old.""

The vote in favour of the bill was unanimous at its final reading, the Assembly said on Twitter.

There had been concerns from some lawmakers that an age of consent below which sex automatically constituted rape might criminalise a consensual sexual relationship between a minor and a person only a few years older.

As a consequence, a ""Romeo and Juliet"" clause that allows for sexual relations between a minor and an individual up to five years older. The clause will not apply in cases of sexual assault.

The legislation also considers incestuous sex with a minor under 18 to be rape.

In a country that has long cherished its self-image as the land of seduction and romance, sexual abuse against women and children for years went undetected or undeclared in the upper echelons of power and within celebrity circles.

But there has been much soul-searching in recent years.

The #MeToo movement that swept around the world after numerous women in 2017 accused U.S. movie producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault proved a turning point in France. So too did the fall from grace in 2020 of a French writer who had written openly about his pedophilia.

France had already toughened its sex crimes laws in 2018 when it outlawed sexual harassment on the streets, leaving cat-callers and aggressively lecherous individuals facing potential on-the-spot fines.

In 2016, Raul Castro said he would step down in five years but in a country that's been led by the same family for six decades, that certainly wasn't take for granted.





Just now through the 89-year-old confirmed that he will step down as the first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba in a speech at the party congress.





That will pave the way for a new generation of leadership -- none of who participated in the revolution -- to lead the country. The transition will take place this weekend and is likely to put 60-year-old Miguel Díaz-Canel in charge.









The transition is an opening for softening relations between the US and Cuba. Biden has signaled he wants to thaw the relationship after Trump reversed Obama-era reforms.





The Florida now appears to be a solidly Republican state may open a window to end the US embargo. Cuba implemented some reforms last year to allow people to operate small businesses. It's also loosening controls in state-run firms.

1,Everything Is RUINED: Deborah Just Scheduled Her Video Game Expo For The Same Time As Ours Even Though We Already Opened Our Doors And Her Rich Parents Are Hiring Bobby Flay,https://ogn.theonion.com/everything-is-ruined-deborah-just-scheduled-her-video-1845186066,"Goddamnit, gamers. We don’t know if you heard, but apparently, we aren’t allowed to have even one nice thing without it being destroyed by that backstabbing bitch Deborah Hart. In fact, we here at OGN might as well cancel our entire Onion Gaming Expo because even though we already sent out invites to our conference and people are showing up, Deborah scheduled her video game expo for the exact same time as ours and her rich parents are hiring Bobby Flay to cook hors d’oeuvres.

We seriously just want to kill ourselves right now, readers!

What makes this even worse is that we know for a fact that Deborah never even wanted to hold a video game conference before she heard about ours. We were nice enough to suggest that she come to OGE like a week after we had the idea, and she just said, “Oh yeah, maybe.” But now she’s invited all the same people that were on our guest list and got American celebrity chef Bobby Flay himself to put together little finger sandwiches and lamb kebab lollipops, while we’re still stuck trying to get Mangiano’s House of Pizza to donat e some free bread sticks and soda.

We can’t help but think this is all a lot of horseshit, gamers. After the months of hard work we put into OGE, Deborah just up and throws her own bash o n the first weekend of August? There’s no way that’s a coincidence. Plus, we can’t do anything to upstage her because her parents are executives at Wells Fargo or something and can afford to hire culinary master Bobby Flay and rent out a karaoke machine to play 8 -bit versions of pop songs for the whole night. Meanwhile, we all had to get part-time jobs to pay for the streamers that we picked up at Party City. Also, Deborah gets an allowance of $300 a week just for sweeping the kitchen, but she makes their housekeeper do it most of the time anyway, and she’s not even spending any of that money on her video game expo!

Look, let’s be real: Deborah isn’t even an actual gamer— she’s just doing this because she likes that guy Brock on the varsity basketball team and she knows he’s into video games. Sure, Deborah’s family has a Nintendo Switch and she plays Animal Crossing: New Horizons sometimes, but that’s not enough to explain a sudden interest in having thousands of people flock to a rented-out convention center for a whole five-day gaming extravaganza featuring a chef extraordinaire with his own show on the Food Network.

It’s just like the time she debuted her own Portal 2 demo impressions right before we did so people would vote for her for homecoming queen.

Then again, we all know why more people might show up to Deb orah’s thing. She’s easy. Like, really easy. Yeah, we said it. And we’re sure that Bobby Flay would much rather come to our conference if he knew all the rumors about Deborah giving out handjobs in the Golden Corral parking lot in exchange for free beer. She’s also totally flat and stuffs her bra, but you didn’t hear that from us, gamers.

0,"Alabama - Yoga can leave you injured, psychotic and a Hindu, Christian groups claim",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/17/alabama-yoga-ban-public-schools-christian-groups,"Jeremy Gray, a state lawmaker in Alabama, has been practicing yoga for years, initially as a workout after college football matches and later as a means of instilling in himself the virtues of focus and patience.

Now the Democrat from Opelika needs all the patience he can get as he seeks to overturn a 28-year yoga ban in Alabama public schools. The ban, believed to be the only statewide prohibition of its sort in America, is proving to be tougher to scrub from the statute books than might be expected.

Gray is preparing to present a bill to the Alabama senate that would allow public schools and students to engage in yoga during gym classes for the first time in almost three decades. The lifting of the ban was approved by the state house of representatives in March, and last week Gray’s bill passed out of the senate judiciary committee and now awaits a full debate and vote on the senate floor.

But the closer Gray’s vision comes to fruition, the more it draws enemy fire. The main hurdle to reform lies with conservative Christian groups who argue that just the mere act of allowing yoga in the classroom will expose kids to the risk of converting to Hinduism.

“Yoga is a very big part of the Hindu religion, and if this bill passes then instructors will be able to come into classrooms as young as kindergarten and bring these children through guided imagery, which is a spiritual exercise,” Becky Gerritson, director of the conservative Alabama Eagle told state senators recently.

The idea that yoga is a gateway drug to Hinduism strikes Gray as palpably ridiculous. He has practiced yoga for 10 years, yet remains a committed Christian worshipping in a Baptist church.

“The promoting of Hinduism argument is the only talking point these conservative groups have, and it makes them look very misinformed and miseducated on the issue,” Gray told the Guardian.

The lawmaker said that he was struck by the contrast between the view of teachers who were strongly in favor of lifting the ban so that schoolchildren could benefit from yoga’s ability to reduce anxiety and depression, and the conservatives who had never tried yoga and who had no direct connection to public schools who were opposing it.

“To me you cannot be well versed on something you never experienced. We have individuals opposing a bill that really doesn’t affect them, but those individuals in education are 100% behind it,” Gray said.

The lawmaker points to official statistics that show that one in seven Americans have had some experience of yoga. The federal public health agency the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of yoga and meditation in schools to reduce “those stressful feelings and increase your ability to remember things more clearly”.

But conservative groups are not giving up without a fight. The National Center for Law & Policy, an organization of Christian lawyers who take on legal cases backing anti-abortion, anti-gay marriage and other causes that they call “civil liberties”, has produced a factsheet claiming to prove that yoga cannot be separated from its religious roots in Hinduism.

“Yoga can be dangerous, causing injuries, death from stroke, and psychotic episodes,” the document says.

Nikunj Trivedi, president of the Coalition of Hindus of North America, said that the latest claims were just a new iteration of age-old discrimination against America’s 2.5 million Hindus. “These arguments are a reminder of the Hindu-phobia that existed in the US in the 19th and early 20th century, when Hindus were portrayed as strange cult followers out to alter your mind and get you to do crazy things. It’s sad to see such Hindu-phobia still persisting.”

Trivedi added that the physical stretching that most Americans associate with yoga has nothing to do with the religious manifestations of the art. “Most people don’t do yoga, what they do is asana or postures. Doing postures is not going to make you Hindu,” he said.",665,3972,14,83

India breached 200,000 daily infections for the first time on Thursday, and is trying to inoculate more of its population using domestically produced shots.

Facing soaring cases and overflowing hospitals after lockdown restrictions were eased, it also abruptly changed the rules to allow it to fast-track vaccine imports, having earlier rebuffed foreign drugmakers like Pfizer.

It will import Russia's Sputnik V vaccine starting this month to cover as many as 125 million people.

The reversal in fortunes could hamper not only India's battle to contain the pandemic, but also vaccination campaigns in more than 60 poorer countries, mainly in Africa, for months.

The COVAX programme, backed by the World Health Organization and Gavi vaccine alliance, aims at equitable vaccine access around the world, and is relying heavily on supplies from India, Asia's pharmaceutical powerhouse.

But so far this month India has only exported around 1.2 million vaccine doses. That compares with 64 million doses shipped abroad between late January and March, according to data from the foreign ministry.

An official with knowledge of India's vaccine strategy said that available shots would be used domestically while the country faced an ""emergency situation"".

""There is no commitment to other countries,"" he said.

India's foreign ministry, which oversees vaccine deals with other countries, said last week that Indian demand would dictate the level of exports.

Resulting shortages are already being felt in some countries in the COVAX scheme, and a U.N. health official involved in the vaccine rollout in Africa said: ""To be so reliant on one manufacturer is a massive concern.""

The director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, said earlier this month delays in supplies from India could be ""catastrophic"".

MISSTEPS

Four sources involved in discussions on vaccine supplies and procurement said factors including delays by India and COVAX in placing firm orders, a lack of investment in production, raw material shortages and underestimating the coronavirus surge at home had contributed to vaccine shortages.

The Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's biggest vaccine manufacturer, had vowed to deliver at least 2 billion COVID-19 shots to low and middle-income countries, with nearly half of that by the end of 2021.

But it has also come under pressure to meet the needs of other governments, including Britain, Canada and Saudi Arabia, amid AstraZeneca's global production problems.

The United States, meanwhile, ring-fenced the supply of key equipment and raw materials for its own vaccine makers, limiting SII's operations and delaying by months its goal of raising monthly output to 100 million from up to 70 million now, said one of the sources.

A further initial hurdle to SII's supply ambitions was India's hesitation in placing firm orders, two sources said.

That could have allowed it to boost output of the AstraZeneca vaccine early, even though regulators had yet to approve it.

India spent months discussing the final price per dose, and inked an initial purchase order roughly two weeks after India's drug regulator approved the AstraZeneca shot, according to the sources.

At one point, SII ran out of space to store produced doses.

""That is why I chose not to pack more than 50 million doses, because I knew if I packed more than that, I would have to store it in my house,"" SII Chief Executive Adar Poonawalla told Reuters in January.

He said he had spent 20 billion rupees ($272 million) on the 50 million doses that the company started stockpiling since around October.

Even now, the government only makes ad-hoc purchases from SII instead of agreeing a longer-term supply schedule, said one of the sources.

SII has sought more than $400 million from the government to increase capacity, but no commitment has yet been made.

The health department and foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment on issues of funding, purchasing delays and other aspects of India's vaccination rollout.

COVAX CONUNDRUM

COVAX also did not green-light shipments to participating countries from SII until after the shot received WHO clearance in mid-February, said a source involved in the COVAX initiative.

The source said those delays meant tens of millions of additional doses that the SII could have produced between October and February never materialised.

Gavi defended its decision to wait for proper approvals before going ahead with firm orders. And while it is looking for more suppliers, it conceded that much still depended on India's vaccine makers who account for some 60% of global supplies.

COVAX has a deal to buy 1 billion-plus doses from the SII. But it has received less than a fifth of the 100 million or so doses of the SII-made AstraZeneca vaccine it had expected by May. SII is also supposed to make millions of doses of the Novavax shot for COVAX.

Gavi had hoped SII would fully resume vaccine deliveries to COVAX in May, but on Wednesday it said India's COVID-19 crisis could affect that.

""We understand the ferocity of the virus in India at the current time, nevertheless we hope and expect deliveries to resume as soon as possible,"" it said in an email to Reuters.

On Thursday India reported 200,739 infections over the past 24 hours, a seventh daily record in the last eight days, while 1,038 deaths took its toll to 173,123. Its tally of 14.1 million infections is second only to the United States.

Having originally aimed to cover 300 million of its highest-risk people by August, or just over a fifth of its 1.35 billion population, the government has now expanded that by another 100 million, with the promise to widen it further.

The Kremlin has steadfastly denied the allegations that it proffered bounties though its military intelligence service, the GRU. However, Psaki said the intelligence community has higher confidence in other reports of the GRU’s involvement in the region.

“This information really puts the burden on Russian and the Russian government to explain their engagement here,” she said. “We still feel there are questions to be answered by the Russian government.”

The administration’s admission undercuts a narrative wielded by then-candidate Joe Biden against former President Donald Trump on the campaign trail. Biden repeatedly raised the possibility of Russian bounties as further evidence that Trump treated Russia with kid gloves at the expense of the military, and used it as a cudgel against him.

At the time, Trump had dismissed initial media reporting of the allegations as a “hoax” and a ""fake issue"" and later said that intelligence officials had not briefed him on the alleged bounties because they did not believe it to be credible information.

Biden had raised the bounty issue, among other topics, with Russian President Vladimir Putin in January when the two leaders held their first call together after Biden took office. The president did not bring it up during a subsequent call with Putin earlier this week, according to a summary put out by the White House.

On Thursday, Biden levied new sanctions on Putin's government and expelled 10 Russian diplomats from the United States in response to election interference, cyberespionage and other hostile actions. Some lawmakers have urged Biden to go even further, including targeting the Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany — a move that would be complicated by Germany being one of the U.S.'s key allies.

""I proudly announce that Iranian scientists ... have managed to produce uranium enriched to 60 percent"", speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf wrote on Twitter.

At the same time, the head of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, Ali Akbar Salehi, confirmed that the operation is ""underway at the Martyr Ahmadi Roshan nuclear facility"" in Natanz.

Iran managed to boost its programme using IR-4 and IR-6 centrifuges, which are much faster than its first-generation IR-1 centrifuges, allowed by the 2015 nuclear deal.

Tehran's intentions, previously announced by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) sparked international concerns, with the EU calling the Iranian plans ""extremely worrisome from a nuclear non-proliferation perspective"".

International nuclear organisations consider uranium to be weapons-grade if it is enriched to a level of 20 percent or more., while 90 percent is needed for the production of nuclear weapons.

Iran started suspending its obligations set in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2019, precisely one year after the United States pulled out of the agreement and reimposed economic sanctions against the Middle Eastern country.

Last December, Tehran passed a law to boost its uranium enrichment and stop IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities in response to the killing of nuclear physicist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, which the Iranians blamed on Israel.

The United States said they are ready to overturn Trump's withdrawal from the JCPOA but need Iran to stop violating the deal first, while the Islamic republic stressed that Washington has to suspend the unilateral sanctions before any talks are possible.",339,2208,10,65

Not on my watch. All we had to do is send in some planes, bomb a few of our bases, and tell the Russians where to send the payment. Believe me, no other president has handled Russia the way I have. No one.” At press time, Republican lawmakers defended Trump’s decision, stating that the president’s methods might be unconventional, but collecting bounties placed on the heads of American troops was good for the economy.

0,'Big six' agree to join 'Super League',https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/56795811,"Last updated on .From the section European Football

Liverpool and Manchester United are the two most successful sides in English football history

Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham are among 12 clubs who have agreed to join a new European Super League (ESL).

In a seismic move for European football, the Premier League clubs will join AC Milan, Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Inter Milan, Juventus and Real Madrid.

The ESL said the founding clubs had agreed to establish a ""new midweek competition"" with teams continuing to ""compete in their respective national leagues"".

It says the inaugural season ""is intended to commence as soon as practicable"" and ""anticipated that a further three clubs will join"" the breakaway.

The ESL says it also plans to launch a women's competition as soon as possible after the men's tournament starts.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Uefa and the Premier League condemned the move to launch a European Super League when news of it broke on Sunday.

World governing body Fifa has previously said it would not recognise such a competition and any players involved in it could be denied the chance to play at a World Cup.

Uefa, Europe's governing body, reiterated this warning on Sunday when it said players involved would be banned from all other competitions at domestic, European or world level and could be prevented from representing their national teams.

After the Super League was announced, Fifa expressed its ""disapproval"" of the proposed competition and called on ""all parties involved in heated discussions to engage in calm, constructive and balanced dialogue for the good of the game"".

In a statement, the ESL said: ""Going forward, the founding clubs look forward to holding discussions with Uefa and Fifa to work together in partnership to deliver the best outcomes for the new league and for football as a whole.""

Dion Dublin & Danny Murphy discuss the plans for a European Super League

Why now?

There were talks in October, involving Wall Street bank JP Morgan, over a new £4.6bn competition that would replace the Champions League.

Uefa had hoped the plans for a new 36-team Champions League - with reforms set to be confirmed on Monday - would head off the formation of a Super League.

However, the 12 sides involved in the Super League do not think the reforms go far enough.

They said the global pandemic has ""accelerated the instability in the existing European football economic model"".

""In recent months, extensive dialogue has taken place with football stakeholders regarding the future format of European competitions,"" they added.

""The founding clubs believe the solutions proposed following these talks do not solve fundamental issues, including the need to provide higher-quality matches and additional financial resources for the overall football pyramid.""

What is the proposed format?

The league will have 20 teams - the 12 founding members plus the three unnamed clubs they expect to join soon and five sides who qualify annually according to their domestic achievements.

Under the proposals, the ESL campaign would start in August each year, with midweek fixtures, and the clubs would be split into two groups of 10, playing each other home and away.

The top three in each group would qualify for the quarter-finals, with the teams in fourth and fifth playing a two-legged play-off for the two remaining spots.

From then on, it would have the same two-leg knockout format used in the Champions League before a single-leg final in May at a neutral venue.

The ESL says it will generate more money than the Champions League and would result in a greater distribution of revenue throughout the game.

What do the Super League leaders say?

Juventus and AC Milan have signed up to the breakaway league plans

Real Madrid president Florentino Perez is the first chairman of the ESL and says ""we will help football at every level"".

""Football is the only global sport in the world with more than four billion fans and our responsibility as big clubs is to respond to their desires,"" he added.

Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli has resigned from the Uefa executive committee and as chairman of the European Club Association (ECA), which had pushed the planned Champions League reforms.

He said the 12 clubs had ""come together at this critical moment, enabling European competition to be transformed, putting the game we love on a sustainable footing for the long-term future"".

Manchester United co-chairman Joel Glazer will be a vice-chairman of the Super League.

He said: ""By bringing together the world's greatest clubs and players to play each other throughout the season, the Super League will open a new chapter for European football, ensuring world-class competition and facilities, and increased financial support for the wider football pyramid.""

What has been the reaction?

Essentially, widespread condemnation from anyone not involved in the proposed league.

Johnson said the plans will be ""very damaging for football"" and France's President Emmanuel Macron welcomed French clubs refusing to join.

Uefa released a joint statement with England's Football Association, the Premier League, the Spanish Football Federation, La Liga and the Italian Football Federation, as well as Serie A, saying they will ""remain united"" in trying to stop the breakaway, using ""all available measures"".

The ECA ""strongly opposed"" the league, while the Football Supporters' Association said the plans were ""motivated by nothing but cynical greed"".

Among ex-professionals, former Liverpool and Tottenham midfielder Danny Murphy told BBC Sport the plans ""sound soulless"", former Manchester United captain Gary Neville told Sky Sports he was ""absolutely disgusted"", while former team-mate Rio Ferdinand said on BT Sport that the proposals will hurt fans the most.

'The ultimate betrayal'

Fan groups associated with all six English clubs are strongly opposed to the Super League.

Liverpool supporters' group Spirit of Shankly (SOS) said they were ""appalled"" by the decision of Fenway Sports Group, the club's US-based owner.

In a social media post, SOS said: ""FSG have ignored fans in their relentless and greedy pursuit of money. Football is ours, not theirs. Our football club is ours not theirs.""

Chelsea Supporters' Trust called the move ""unforgivable"" and said their members and ""football supporters across the world have experienced the ultimate betrayal"".

The Arsenal Supporters' Trust called their club's agreement to join ""the death of Arsenal as a sporting institution"".

Manchester City FC Official Supporters Club said the move showed ""those involved have zero regard for the game's traditions"" and they were ""determined to fight against this proposed Super League"".

The Manchester United Supporters Trust had earlier said the proposals were ""completely unacceptable"" and the ESL ""goes against everything football, and Manchester United, should stand for"".

Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust said the ESL was a ""concept driven by avarice and self-interest at the expense of the intrinsic values of the game we hold so dear"".

Analysis

BBC Sport's Simon Stone

If there was any lingering doubt over the desire of these 12 clubs to launch their own competition, it has been removed by their statement - reinforced by each of them through their own media platforms.

So many questions remain unanswered.

Chiefly, can they actually get their plan over the line given the strong resistance from Uefa and the leagues and associations of the countries concerned?

But beyond that, who will the other three clubs be to make up the 15 founding members? Will Bayern Munich and Paris St Germain eventually join up? And how will the other five clubs be decided?

These discussions will be fascinating. But right now, the clubs who have signed up to the European Super League have a public relations battle to turn around perceptions - because initial reaction has been overwhelmingly negative.",1275,8015,7,38

Military officials in Canberra have been planning out 'worst case' scenarios in which Collins-class submarines and Super Hornet fighter jets would be deployed to the Taiwan Strait to assist the United States and other regional strategic allies.

Pressure is mounting on Australia and fellow 'Quad' members - Japan, India and the US - to keep Beijing's forces at bay as tensions continue to soar over the disputed territory.

China has become increasingly aggressive in the region, stamping out pro-democracy groups in Hong Kong and cracking down on Muslims minorities in Xinjiang.

It is now feared the authoritarian state will turn its military might to Taiwan as it looks to re-unify the island under President-for-life Xi Jinping.

China has repeatedly incurred on Taipei's maritime borders and air space and this week it sent a record 25 military aircraft into into the defence 'identification zone'.

Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen (pictured) has remained staunch in the face of Chinese aggression - with many nations now at loggerheads with the communist superpower

'There is a lot of development and scenario planning going on,' a diplomatic source told the Australian Financial Review.

'It is intended to signal you are not going to blink. It is intended to demonstrate you don't lack commitment.'

Taiwan, backed by the US and Japan, has endured a longstanding conflict with Beijing since the Chinese civil war in 1949 and now its residents are more on edge than ever after watching the erosion of freedom and independence in Hong Kong.

But the island nation remains an important ally of western democratic countries for its close proximity to China and because it produces a significant supply of semiconductor microchips at a time when there is a major global shortage.

In the event that China follows through on the rhetoric of its 'Wolf Warrior' diplomats and attempts to annex the island, it's possible the Quad could come to their aid.

A former defence official said Australian maritime assets like Air Warfare Destroyers and Collins-class submarines could be deployed in such an event to 'bottle up' the Chinese navy.

But he admitted there would be great hesitation in doing so as it would put the vital military vessels and their crews at great risk.

He said it's more likely Canberra would send 'maritime surveillance aircraft, air-to-air refuellers, the Wedgetail airborne radar plane and Super Hornet fighter jets, operating from US bases in Guam or the Philippines'.

ADF chief Angus Campbell has said conflict over the island of Taiwan would be 'disastrous' for the people of the region and should be avoided at all cost.

But as China becomes increasingly belligerent on the world stage - carrying out a fatal border conflict with Indian last year and encroaching on Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan, Vietnam and Brunei in the South China Sea - some believe conflict may be inevitable.

Former Defence Minister Christopher Pyne, who served under Malcolm Turnbull, said last week things may well get a whole lot worse as Beijing looks to poke and prod its Asia Pacific neighbours.

'Not a cyber war, but a real one involving loss of life, destruction of military platforms, with aggressors and defenders on different sides.

'This isn't rhetoric. This is something that you and I may well have to confront in the next five to 10 years.'

Australia's relationship with its biggest trading partner began to drastically deteriorate in April last year when Prime Minister Scott Morrison called for an independent inquiry into the origins of coronavirus, which first appeared in Wuhan at the end of 2019.

The plea for transparency over Covid-19 infuriated the Communist Party who retaliated by imposing arbitrary bans and tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Australian goods including barley, wine, cotton, seafood, beef, copper, and coal.

is a UK journalist, ex-Fleet Street editor, financial industry consultant and political communications special advisor in the UK and EU.

Pakistan Premier Imran Khan, struggling to stop hardliners from venting their fury, has banned a radical party and pulled the plug on social media. But he’s the one who first lit the fuse and is now paying the price.

When he first waded into the domestic affairs of France, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan probably thought he could rely on the muscle of fellow Muslim leaders, including bellicose Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, to help see off complaints about over-reach.

Also on rt.com Muslim boycott threats and politics play out in attacks on ‘mentally ill’ Macron as he ups the rhetoric against Islamists

However, in just six months, the relationship between Islamabad and Paris has deteriorated to such an extent that French nationals and companies have now been told by their government to leave the Muslim nation “because of the serious threats to French interests in Pakistan”.

Radical Islamists are largely to blame for the escalation of hostilities and mobilised crowds via social media and messaging apps to blockade the country’s two largest cities, Lahore and Karachi, earlier this week.

This forced Khan’s hand and he has had the leader of the hardline political party, Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), arrested. In the violent demonstrations that followed Saad Rizvi’s detention, two police officers were killed. The party, instrumental in stirring up anger against France over satirical caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad published in Charlie Hebdo magazine, has now been banned and its dissolution sought in the country’s Supreme Court.

In a more direct effort to prevent troubleseeking Islamist mobs assembling, the government today also asked the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority to pull the plug on Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube and Telegram nationwide to prevent TLP radicals from winding up others during Friday prayers.

It’s a serious move and shows that the Pakistan leader recognises things have got out of hand. However, he has to take a large share of the blame for things reaching this point.

Tensions were running high across the Islamic world following President Emmanuel Macron’s defence of the publication of caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed and their use in French school lessons which had led to the the decapitation of schoolteacher Samuel Paty last year and a second terrorist attack which left three more people dead in just a matter of days.

Macron’s staunch defence of the French laïcité (secularism) provoked a series of angry Twitter responses from PM Khan, keen to display his Islamic credentials by alleging that the French president had “chosen to encourage Islamophobia by attacking Islam rather than the terrorists who carry out violence.”

And it was that tone which set the cat among the pigeons.

Macron doubled down, tweeting later on the same day: “We will not give in, ever.

We respect all differences in a spirit of peace. We do not accept hate speech and defend reasonable debate.”

Also on rt.com Macron needs the help of Muslim world leaders or France’s tally of decapitated heads will continue to rise

As ill-feeling bubbled along, it was revealed that France had decided not to assist with the upgrade of the 150 Mirage fighter jets that Dassault Aviation had sold to Pakistan, leaving Khan with only half a fleet fit to fly. Similar requests to help upgrade the country’s French-Italian air defence system, along with its three Agosta 90B submarines, were also declined.

The pressure has been building on Pakistan ever since but the radicals are on a roll.

Meanwhile, in Turkey, the redoubtable Erdogan eventually chose a more pragmatic line and patched things up with his French counterpart last month, releasing a statement that both countries “can contribute significantly to stability and peace” and that “Turkey wishes to cooperate with France” in seeking to achieve their mutual aims in Europe, the Caucasus, the Middle East and Africa.

Khan, however, has found it harder to rein in the fury of the TLP and its supporters, who are still seething over what they see as state-sanctioned blasphemy against Islam by France, for which a price must be paid.

The problem for the former international playboy and cricket star who now leads a population of more than 212 million people – including 174 million Muslims – is that he not only lacks the authority of his Turkish friend – with a much smaller population of 82 million – but that the constitutional empowerment of Pakistan’s religion makes it more difficult to pivot when a touch of pragmatism is needed to diffuse a tricky situation.

If the banning of the TLP and the heavy handed restrictions on social media have the desired effect in keeping the radicals from dictating the public mood, Khan might have enough breathing space to start rebuilding his relationship with Macron.

Otherwise he risks being isolated, stuck with a hamstrung military, and being viewed as a Islamist terrorist sympathiser to be kept at arm’s length by the rest of the world’s leaders.

Islamabad, Pakistan – Pakistan has temporarily blocked Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp and some other social media services across the country as part of a security crackdown on a far-right religious party, officials say.

The temporary ban blocked all access to social media platforms Facebook, Twitter and YouTube and messaging apps Whatsapp and Telegram across the country starting at 11:00am local time (06:00 GMT) on Friday, an interior ministry official said.

“This was imposed in anticipation of [Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan or TLP] protests and their penetration in the social media [is very high],” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

The official said the “temporary ban” would be lifted at 3:00pm local time (10:00 GMT), although several areas continued to report outages past that time.

A second official familiar with the issue confirmed to Al Jazeera that the services had been blocked by the government, with the country’s telecommunications regulator saying the step had been taken “in order to maintain public order and safety”.

The far-right TLP has held days of violent protests against the arrest of its leader Saad Rizvi on Monday.

Clashes between police and protesters have left at least four policemen dead and more than 600 wounded, official said on Friday.

TLP supporters throw stones over a police armoured vehicle during a protest in Islamabad [File: Aamir Qureshi/AFP] At their height, the protests saw major intercity highway closed and roads in major cities such as Karachi, the country’s largest city, the eastern city of Lahore and the capital Islamabad blocked.

Police fired water cannon, tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters as they attempted to disperse them.

The protests had largely quelled by Thursday, but limited demonstrations continued in some areas. Authorities said they feared the TLP would launch large protests following midday congregational prayers on Friday.

A day earlier, the government formally banned the TLP under anti-terrorism legislation, with the National Counter-Terrorism Authority (NACTA) adding it to Pakistan’s list of “proscribed organisations”.

Also on Thursday, the French government told citizens and French companies to leave Pakistan due to “serious threats” from the TLP protests.

In November, the TLP launched a days-long sit-in protest blocking a major highway into the capital Islamabad over remarks by French President Emmanuel Macron that many, including Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan, said “encouraged Islamophobia”.

Macron had defended publications’ right to reprint controversial caricatures of Islam’s Prophet Muhammad, an act considered “blasphemous” by some Muslims.

Founded in 2017 by firebrand cleric Khadim Hussain Rizvi, the TLP has campaigned on a one-point agenda of fighting perceived “blasphemy”, organising several mass protests across the country over its opposition to laws it considers blasphemous and the acquittal of a Christian woman of the crime of blasphemy.

The party holds three seats in the provincial assembly of the southern province of Sindh. On Thursday, the government said it would begin proceedings to have the party delisted by the Election Commission, potentially unseating those three lawmakers.

Blasphemy is a sensitive subject in Pakistan and insulting the Quran, Islam’s Prophet Muhammad or Muslim holy personages can carry a mandatory death penalty.

Since 1990, at least 78 people have been murdered in connection with blasphemy allegations across Pakistan, according to an Al Jazeera tally.

The train was heading from Cairo to the Nile Delta city of Mansoura when four carriages derailed at 1.54pm (7.54pm Singapore time), about 40km north of Cairo, Egyptian National Railways said in a short statement.

The cause of the accident is being investigated, it added.

More than 50 ambulances took the injured to three hospitals in the province, the health ministry said.

The derailing is the latest of several recent railway crashes in Egypt.

At least 20 people were killed and nearly 200 were injured in March when two trains collided near Tahta, about 440km south of Cairo.

Fifteen people were injured this month when two train carriages derailed near Minya al-Qamh city, about 70km north of Cairo.

Egypt’s transportation minister Kamel El-Wazir, a former army general, has faced calls to resign from some Egyptians on social media. He has rejected these and vowed to keep working on developing the ageing rail network.

And, hey, if you happen to be on the fence because the idea of hunting creatures for loot doesn’t quite sit right with you, we have some great news. One of Rise’s best new features is a dossier listing every monster’s problematic behavior so you don’t have to feel bad when you kill them.

Advertisement

Turns out these beasts have some pretty ugly history, gamers, and they deserve everything that’s coming to them!



What’s great is that this dossier—accessed by hitting the triangle button—erases the twinge of regret we always felt in past Monster Hunter outings as we mowed through Kelbis for horns and pelts. Pair this with a robust new morality system that lets you know immediately that the monster you are stalking is an anti-vaxxer or has made uncomfortable passes at female coworkers, and we’re talking about a game that’s not only a blast to play, but also really cares about easing the burden on your conscience!



Seamlessly integrated into the gameplay, accessing the new Problematic Stats system is as simple as locking onto a monster, popping open the radial menu, and selecting “offenses” to discover that, say, the Barroth in front of you once screamed at an elderly supermarket cashier back in the late aughts and that there’s video evidence to boot! It’s all in service of making sure you should feel free to smash their head in with a hunting horn without any misgivings.

With this huge gameplay improvement, all players can rest easy knowing that these monsters are just suffering the natural consequences of their past bad behavior. When you see that a monster listens to Ben Shapiro’s podcast, the thought “W hy am I hurting this animal?” immediately drops out of your head and instead becomes “H ow can I hurt this animal?” Plus, newbies who may have been turned off by what was once a world of complex, inaccessible lore, ecology, and culture will find everything has been streamlined to make each decision to take a life not only easy, but easily rationalized.



Sorry Wroggi, but that’s what you get for continuing to enjoy the works of Orson Scott Card!

With so much justifiable concern over the moral implications of violent games and their power fantasies, it’s great to see a developer like Capcom take a step like this that makes their franchise more accessible to everyone. In the future, OGN can only hope that more titles—whether Super Mario Galaxy or Horizon Zero Dawn—go the extra mile and include problematic behavior systems so we can continue to hop on Goomba s’ heads and smash down robotic dinosaurs without any regret whatsoever!",462,2727,21,128

The law also gives the government powers to re-evaluate and revoke residence permits for those people if the conditions in the place they fled from are “significantly improved.”

This is all because Denmark, alone out of any Western government and against the advice of all notable organisations and authorities in the field, has determined that the Syrian capital Damascus is safe enough for refugees to return, and has begun the process of revoking residence permits.

Issa’s family escaped the civil war in Syria , and for several years they have lived in northern Denmark. But now Issa, her younger sister, and their mother, along with 500 other Syrian nationals , face having their right to live in the country rescinded.

“We have nothing in Syria, not even a house. What are we going to do, live on the street?”

The Syrian civil war began in March 2011, and over the past decade more than 400,000 people have died, 6 million people have been displaced, and entire cities have been razed. More than 13 million of the country’s current population of 17 million depend on humanitarian aid to survive. By the bloody standards of the conflict, the fighting has mostly stopped, and while the government is not in complete control of the country, the regime has effectively won.

The situation facing Issa is Kafkaesque. Denmark does not officially recognise the regime of Bashar al-Assad , and therefore is not currently considering forced deportations. Instead, Issa and her family must choose to either return voluntarily – something she says is out of the question – or move into a deportation centre designed to make going back to war-torn Syria seem more enticing.

Last year, a report by the Danish Office of Immigration concluded that the situation in and around Damascus had improved to such an extent that refugees from the area no longer qualified for protection under that law. And as such, the centre-left but anti-immigration Social Democrat government in Denmark has started to inform people like Issa and her family that they are no longer welcome.

Denmark’s assessment that Damascus is safe for refugees to return to is based on the fact that the regime forces have control of the capital and its surroundings. But for those who fled the brutality of Assad and his troops, the idea of returning to an area controlled by the very same military is absurd. Peace is not the same as security, critics say.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN watchdog that works to protect the rights of refugees, said earlier this year that Damascus was not safe for Syrian refugees to return to. It also said that forcing people to return could constitute a breach of the UN Refugee Convention , which Denmark was the first country to sign in 1952. In a statement to VICE World News, the UNHCR Representation for the Nordic and Baltic countries, said: “UNHCR is concerned about this development as UNHCR does not consider the recent improvements in security in parts of Syria to be sufficiently fundamental, stable or durable to justify ending international protection for any group of refugees. UNHCR continues to call for protection to be maintained for Syrian refugees and urge that they should not be returned forcibly to any part of Syria, regardless of who is in control of the area concerned.”

“The very reason the general level of violence in greater Damascus has fallen is that it has come under the full control of one of the most [violent] and notoriously repressive regimes,” he said. “It makes no sense that the authorities would send back Syrian refugees to an area controlled by a government they don’t recognise and refuse to cooperate with due to their human rights abuses,” said Zahle.

“There is no one else in the world who thinks Damascus is safe,” said Villads Zahle, a communications officer at the European Council for Refugees and Exiles, an umbrella organisation which monitors refugee rights in Europe. Zahle said he was bewildered that Denmark would consider returning refugees to a country controlled by a regime that Denmark itself refuses to recognise.

The prospect of returning to Syria clearly terrifies Issa. Her family fled from Damascus in 2015 because her father and brother were being pursued by the regime. Issa’s father died shortly after the family arrived in Denmark, and along with her mother and younger sister, she also has an older sister, as well as her brother. By a cruel bureaucratic twist, her brother and older sister are not facing deportation, as they technically arrived in Denmark as political refugees, a classification that was not extended to the rest of the family. “I know that if they send us back, I’ll never see them again,” Issa said. “They mean everything to my mom and I.”

“There’s a risk that you can disappear with no one knowing where you are, or you can be put in prison. And we know that, in the regime’s prisons, they use abuse and torture, and some even die. This is partly because of the horrible conditions in the prisons, but sometimes because they are executed,” she told VICE World News. “So these are some of the worst types of human rights violations that we’re seeing.”

“We absolutely do not believe that the situation has changed enough to start suspending residence permits or refuse to offer them protection based on the general level of violence in Syria and Damascus,” said Lisa Blinkenberg, senior policy adviser at Amnesty International.

In January this year, Amnesty International sent an open letter to Denmark’s Minister of Immigration and Integration, Mattias Tesfaye, warning him against going through with the decision due to the Syrian regime’s well-documented record of human rights abuses against political dissidents.

Many other families face being separated in this way, and due to the way refugees were classified when they first arrived in Denmark, it is mainly Syrian children, women, and the elderly having their residence permits torn up. This is because younger men are legally considered victims of individual persecution by the regime, often due to them being military deserters.

It is well known in Syria that if you are arrested by regime forces, you are likely to disappear never to be seen again. It is estimated that almost 100,000 people have been victims of “enforced disappearances” by the regime since 2011. And in 2019, the Washington Post reported that despite Assad urging refugees to return home, those who did were welcomed by the regime with arrests and interrogations, and in some cases with torture.

She continued: “If my mom is sent back, she’ll have to account for her son and husband’s escape from the regime. My mom risks going to prison and being tortured, because they want to punish her for her family fleeing.”

“Everyone who’s lived in Syria knows this,” said Issa. “If one family member is in their sights, the entire family is responsible for that person. If we go back, they will do so many horrible things to us. They are going take us, and they are going to torture us. I’m really scared.”

If they were to return to Syria, Issa says her family would likely be persecuted by the regime for having fled alongside her brother and father, who were being pursued, and by the simple fact that the entire family is Kurdish, a group that has historically been discriminated against by the Syrian authorities and has been a key opposition force during the war.

On top of all this, Issa’s mother is unwell, suffering from diabetes, herniated discs in both neck and back, high cholesterol, and mental health challenges too, meaning Issa would have to provide for her mother and younger sister, just 13, in Syria.

The family are currently waiting for their appeals to be heard in the only court that can overturn the decision to remove their residence permits, with a ruling expected in either May or June. Until then their lives are on hold.

Most if not all of the refugees who have now had their residence permits revoked are expected to refuse to voluntarily return to Syria, meaning that they will instead be lodged at one of three deportation centres in Denmark. There is limited opportunity for personal development at the centres, with no access to education or work, and the conditions of life there are often described as prison-like. Families face a purgatory-like existence, with no set end date, until the government negotiates an agreement with the Assad regime to begin forced deportations, or until they’re so tired of their situation that they’d rather return to Syria.",1513,8978,13,72
0,Authorities release photo of FedEx gunman Brandon Scott Hole,https://nypost.com/2021/04/16/authorities-release-photo-fedex-gunman-brandon-scott-hole/,"

Authorities released a photo Friday of the 19-year-old former FedEx worker who went on a shooting spree at a company facility in Indianapolis before turning the gun on himself.

Authorities have identified the shooter as Brandon Scott Hole a local man who last worked for FedEx in 2020 and had previous run-ins with police during a suicidal episode.

Cops still don’t know why Hole used a rifle to kill eight people and wound five others around 11 p.m. Thursday.

“We’ve recently identified him, so now, the work really begins, trying to establish and see if we can figure out some sort of motive in this, but we don’t have that right now,” said Deputy Chief Craig McCartt said at a press conference Friday afternoon.

It was also unclear where Hole got the rifle he used at the plant near the Indianapolis International Airport.

“There were at least 100 people in the facility at the time of the incident. … Many were changing shifts and were on their dinner breaks,” McCartt said.

The fatal victims have not yet been identified, police said.

“Crime Lab is still here they are finishing processing the scene,” McCartt said. “They’re working closely with the coroner’s office. We’re to the point now where we’re identifying victims, making notifications to the family, and then hopefully we’ll wrap up the processing of this crime scene here very shortly.”

Authorities were previously warned about Hole in 2020 when his mother told police she was worried he’d commit suicide by cop.

But the FBI eventually determined no that crime had been committed, nor that Hole had been talking about any racially motivated ideology. He was not given back the shotgun, authorities said.",324,1907,9,60

REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke/Pool

German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged lawmakers on Friday to approve new powers that would allow her to force coronavirus lockdowns and curfews on areas with high infection rates, saying a majority of Germans were in favour of stricter measures.

""The third wave of the pandemic has our country firmly in its grip,"" said Merkel, whose speech in parliament was interrupted by heckling from lawmakers of the far-right Alternative for Germany party opposed to lockdowns.

""Intensive care workers are sending one distress call after the other. Who are we to ignore their pleas?"" Merkel said.

Her government wants parliament to change the Infection Protection Act to enable federal authorities to enforce restrictions even if regional leaders resist them, hoping to alleviate pressure on intensive care units.

The imposition of curfews and granting the federal government powers to force them on Germany's 16 states has also drawn criticism from within Merkel's conservative bloc, which opinion polls suggest will suffer their worst ever result in a September national election.

Unlike Britain and France, Germany has been reluctant to impose drastic limits on movement in a country fiercely protective of democratic freedoms due to its Nazi and Communist past.

Opponents of the lockdown have held demonstrations across Germany, but particularly in the former east, which is more supportive of the AfD. The far-right party says restrictions have failed to halt the pandemic and that they cause more damage to both the economy and people's mental health.

Merkel acknowledged in her speech that the new powers were no bullet-proof solution to the pandemic, which she said could only be defeated with vaccinations.

AfD parliamentary leader Alice Weidel said the new measures were an unprecedented attack on basic democratic freedoms.

""The proposed amendments of the Infection Protection Act are an alarming document of an authoritarian state,"" said Weidel. ""This relapse into the authoritarian demon is coming from the chancellery and you, Madame Chancellor.""

Merkel gazed at her smartphone during most of Weidel's speech.

Oklahoma lawmakers have passed a bill that they’re pretending is about protecting citizens when it’s really about their contempt for anti-racism protesters. The legislation that passed in the Republican-controlled Senate on Wednesday increases penalties for protesters who block streets while granting blanket immunity for drivers who injure or even kill protesters. To the GOP legislators in Oklahoma, I say: If you hate Black Lives Matter so much that you want to run it over in your Honda Pilot, just say so.

Anyway, the Associated Press reports that the bill, which is now on its way to be signed by the governor, passed in the state Senate mostly along party lines with a 38-10 vote. The bill makes blocking public streets during a protest a misdemeanor offense punishable by up to a year in jail and a $5,000 fine.



As AP noted: “Blocking roadways is a longtime tactic of nonviolent protesters dating back to even before the civil rights movement in the 1960s.” A protest isn’t really a protest if no one is being disturbed or inconvenienced, but whatever: Let’s just say for the sake of argument that locking up nonviolent protesters for a year for blocking a street is in the interest of public safety and it’s not being done because conservatives view police brutality as negro extermination porn, and they’re mad people are protesting against it.



There’s still the issue of motorists being allowed to plow through demonstrators without suffering consequences.



From AP:



Sen. Rob Standridge, a Republican from Norman who wrote the bill, said it was prompted mostly by an incident in Tulsa last summer in which a pickup truck drove through a crowd gathered on a Tulsa interstate while protesting the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Several people were injured, including one who was paralyzed from the waist down after falling from an overpass, but the driver, whose family was in the car, was not charged. “The kids cowered in the back seat because they feared for their lives,” Standridge said. “That’s what this bill is about.”

So, let me see if I have this right: A driver hit and injured protesters and wasn’t charged with a crime, and in response to that incident, Standridge pushed a bill that ensures no one will ever be charged with a crime for hitting protesters in the future. No, no, that sounds qu-white reasonable.

What about all the ways this bill could go wrong?

What if during a chaotic protest, a participant ends up blocking a street unknowingly or by accident? That’s worth taking their freedom away for up to a year?

What if motorists take this new law to mean that it’s open season on protesters once they get behind the wheel? Last year, we saw report after report after report involving drivers purposely attacking protesters with their vehicles. Once this bill is signed into law, motorists in Oklahoma can go mowing down protesters knowing all they have to do is tell authorities, “I was in fear for my life.”

One would hope that lawmakers in Oklahoma would have the same energy for bills aimed at curbing the police violence and the systemic racism that necessitates these protests in the first place.



More from AP:



Sen. Kevin Matthews, a Democrat from Tulsa and the chairman of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre Centennial Commission, said he was particularly troubled to see legislation targeting protesters but not the underlying issues of police brutality and systemic racism. “In my community, people were bombed from the air, people had cannons shot into our churches, by some accounts 300 people dead and businesses burned down,” Matthews said, referring to the 1921 attack by a white mob on the city’s Black community. “And it was said my people were rioting when it was not true.”

WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Elation marked the opening Monday of a long-anticipated travel bubble between Australia and New Zealand.

The start of quarantine-free travel was a relief for families who have been separated by the coronavirus pandemic as well as to struggling tourist operators. It marked the first, tentative steps toward what both countries hope will become a gradual reopening to the rest of the world.

The idea of a bubble between Australia and New Zealand had been talked about for months but faced setbacks because of several small virus outbreaks in both countries, which were eventually stamped out.

To mark the occasion, Wellington International Airport painted an enormous welcome sign near its main runway and Air New Zealand ordered some 24,000 bottles of sparkling wine, offering a complimentary glass to adult passengers.

Air New Zealand’s Chief Operating Officer Carrie Hurihanganui said the carrier had previously been running just two or three flights a day between the two countries but that jumped to 30 flights on Monday carrying 5,200 passengers.

She said the day marked a turning point and people were excited.

“You can feel it at the airport and see it on people’s faces,” she said.

The leaders of both countries welcomed the bubble, saying it was a world-leading arrangement because it aimed to both open borders and keep the virus from spreading.

“Today’s milestone is a win-win for Australians and New Zealanders, boosting our economies while keeping our people safe,” Australian Prime Scott Morrison said.

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said her country was welcoming new arrivals.

“The bubble marks a significant step in both countries’ reconnection with the world and it’s one we should all take a moment to be very proud of,” she said.

Travelers who lined up at Sydney and Melbourne airports early Monday said they were excited or relieved to finally fly to New Zealand after more than a year. Some were visiting family and friends, while others were attending funerals.

Both countries have managed to keep out the virus by putting up barriers to the outside world, including strict quarantine requirements for travelers returning from other countries where the virus is rampant.

Australia had previously allowed New Zealanders to arrive without going into quarantine but New Zealand had taken a more cautious approach, requiring travelers from Australia complete a quarantine.

The start of the bubble comes ahead of the New Zealand ski season and is welcome news for many tourist towns, including the ski resort of Queenstown.",485,3058,7,58

With this assignment letter, Kystverket will start acquiring properties in the area, set up a project organization, prepare the tender bases and initiate the tender.

The Ministry of Transport and Communications is now preparing a proposition to the Norwegian Parliament about the project to be presented during the spring.According to Kystverket, 75 million NOK in start-up funds has been set-aside in the state budget for 2021.

Kystverket plans toorganize a conference with pre-qualified contractors during the spring / early summer of this year with the goal of signing contractor during 2021. The plan is to start the construction to start in 2022 ad the tunnel be ready in 2025/2026.

Stad Skipstunnel (Stad Ship Tunnel) will be the worlds first tunnels for ships. The Stad Skipstunnel tunnel is important for the people living in Vestland. Ships going around the Stad peninsula are very much exposed to treacherous waters of the North Sea without any protection due to lack of outlying islands. This costline is considered one of the most dangerous in whole cost of Norway.

Roughly this will be the route (there are several competing route plans close to each other - image from wikimedia Oliver O'Donnell / CC BY-SA)

The Stad Skipstunnel will be 49 metres high and 36 metres wide. It will have a dept of 12 meters. The tunnel will be able to handle ships of up to 16,000 tons.

It has been proposed many decades only. A whole 144 years ago. Finally in 2013 it has been included in the National Transport Plan of Norway.",286,1733,15,78

REUTERS/Christian Hartmann

Sweden is facing an acute shortage of sperm for assisted pregnancy as would-be donors avoid hospitals during the coronavirus pandemic, halting inseminations in large parts of the healthcare system and driving up waiting times by years.

""We're running out of sperm. We've never had so few donors as during the last year,"" said Ann Thurin Kjellberg, head of the reproduction unit at Gothenburg's University Hospital.

The shortage has meant waiting times for assisted pregnancy have shot up from around six months to an estimated 30 months in the past year, possibly longer, doctors familiar with the matter told Reuters.

""It's stressful that we can't get a clear time or date for treatment,"" said Elin Bergsten, a 28-year-old maths teacher from southern Sweden.

Two years ago, Bergsten and her husband learned he was unable to produce semen, and the pair immediately applied for assisted pregnancy. She was due to have her second cycle of insemination before her treatment was indefinitely delayed due to the shortage.

""It's a national phenomenon,"" Thurin Kjellberg said. ""We've run out in Gothenburg and Malmo, they will soon run out in Stockholm,"" she added, naming the three most populous areas of the country.

Beyond public healthcare providers, there are also private clinics in Sweden which are able to circumvent shortages by buying sperm from abroad.

But assisted pregnancy treatment there often costs as much as 100,000 Swedish crowns ($11,785), making it unaffordable for many. Assisted pregnancy is free within Sweden's national health service.

The Nordic countries and Belgium have the highest assisted conception rates in the world, in terms of availability of cycles per million of population, according to the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology.

Under Swedish law, a sperm sample can only be used by a maximum of 6 women. Most donated sperm in Sweden has reached this legal capacity, meaning that in many areas, assisted pregnancy is only available for women who have used a specific sperm sample before.

Margareta Kitlinski, who runs the reproduction unit at Skane University Hospital, the largest such clinic in Sweden, said it takes around 8 months to process a donor due to the many tests involved, and that many samples fail to become viable donations due to common problems in freezing.

""If you have 50 men contact you, at best only half of them could be donors,"" Kitlinski said.

Some Swedish regions have taken to social media to encourage potential male donors, but with varying results. In the meantime, the shortage lingers.

""We need to go on TV and tell Swedish men to come forward,"" Thurin Kjellberg said.

Albert Arie was one of an estimated five Jews left in Egypt, according to Jimena, a website dedicated to the history of Egyptian Jews.

He was one of a group of anti-Zionist Jews who joined the Egyptian nationalist movement and was “celebrated by Egyptians for his refusal to move to Israel,” according to the Jewish blog, Elder Of Ziyon.

During the period in which the Egyptian Jewish community was persecuted and most left the country, which took place in stages according to Arie, first in 1948, then in 1956, followed by 1961 and 1967, Arie stayed behind. He described his life in an October interview he gave to Alarabiya News as part of a documentary on the lives of Egypt’s Jews.

He told the news outlet that when he was a young man, the Jewish community considered Egypt their country and couldn’t imagine a situation that would cause them to leave.

“In the Jewish sect, in 1945, no one could imagine that in 1948 there would be a war and Jews would emigrate,” he said. “It was impossible to think even after what the Muslim Brotherhood did, no one thought they would leave the country.”

Arie is the grandfather of Magda Haroun, the current president of the Egyptian Jewish community. According to Haroun, the community no longer has enough men for a minyan.

“Our numbers are few and one day our presence will no longer exist in Egypt,” she said in the documentary. “But we have to keep and maintain (the synagogues).”",273,1529,10,40

Morgan’s target: The American public.

""I wish Americans would stop pretending to be ‘shocked’ by the country’s unrelenting procession of mass shootings,"" Morgan wrote on Twitter.

""You can’t be ‘shocked’ when something keeps happening that you do nothing to stop,"" he continued. ""Just admit you don’t care enough to act, because you love guns too much.""

Just hours before Morgan commented, a gunman later identified by authorities as Brandon Hole, 19, arrived at the FedEx facility in Indianapolis and allegedly killed eight people and wounded others. Hole later died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, authorities said.

But some social media users pushed back against Morgan’s statements.

A former flight attendant, he borrowed from relatives and poured his $5,000 life savings into opening a clothing shop on the outskirts of Delhi selling custom-designed suits, shirts and pants.The shop, called the Right Fit, opened in February 2020, just weeks before the coronavirus struck India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi abruptly enacted one of the world’s toughest nationwide lockdowns to stop it. Unable to pay the rent, Anand closed the Right Fit two months later.Now Anand, his wife and his two children are among millions of people in India in danger of sliding out of the middle class and into poverty. They depend on handouts from his aging in-laws. Khichdi, or watery lentils cooked with rice, has replaced eggs and chicken at the dinner table. Sometimes, he said, the children go to bed hungry.“I have nothing left in my pocket,” said Anand, 38. “How can I not give food to my children?”Now a second wave of COVID-19 has struck India, and the middle class dreams of tens of millions of people face even greater peril. Already, about 32 million people in India were driven into poverty by the pandemic last year, according to the Pew Research Center, accounting for a majority of the 54 million who slipped out of the middle class worldwide.The pandemic is undoing decades of progress for a country that in fits and starts has brought hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. Already, deep structural problems and the sometimes impetuous nature of many of government’s policies had been hindering growth. A shrinking middle class would deal lasting damage.“It’s very bad news in every possible way,” said Jayati Ghosh, a development economist and professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “It has set back our growth trajectory hugely and created much greater inequality.”The second wave presents difficult choices for India. India on Friday reported more than 216,000 new infections, another record. Lockdowns are back in some states. With work scarce, migrant workers are packing into trains and buses home as they did last year. The country’s vaccination campaign has been slow, though the government has picked up the pace.Yet government appears unwilling to repeat last year’s draconian lockdown, which left more than 100 million Indians jobless and which many economists blame for worsening the pandemic’s problems. The government has also been reluctant to increase spending substantially like the United States and some other places, instead releasing a budget that would raise spending on infrastructure and in other areas but that also emphasizes cutting debt.The Modi government has defended its handling of the pandemic, saying vaccinations are making progress and that signs point to an economic resurgence. Economists are forecasting a rebound in the coming year, though the sudden rise in infections and India’s slow vaccination rate — less than 9% of the population has been inoculated — could undermine those predictions.The heady growth forecasts feel far away for Nikita Jagad, who was out of work for over eight months. Jagad, a 49-year-old resident of Mumbai, stopped going out with her friends, eating at restaurants and even taking bus rides, unless the trip was for a job interview. Sometimes, she said, she shut herself inside her bathroom so her 71-year-old mother wouldn’t hear her crying.Last week, Jagad got a new job as a manager at a company that provides housekeeping services for airlines. It pays less than $400 a month, roughly half her previous salary. It could also be short-lived: the state of Maharashtra, home to Mumbai, announced lockdown-like measures this week to stop the spreading second wave.If she loses her new job, Jagad is still the only support for her mother. “If something happens to her,” she said, “I don’t have the money to even admit her in the hospital.”India’s middle class may not be as wealthy as its peers in the United States and elsewhere, but it makes up an increasingly potent economic force. While definitions vary, Pew Research defines middle-class and upper-middle-class households as living on about $10 to $50 a day. The kind of income could give an Indian family an apartment in a nice neighborhood, a car or a scooter, and the opportunities to send their children to a private school.Roughly 66 million people in India meet that definition, compared with about 99 million just before the pandemic last year, according to Pew Research estimates. These increasingly affluent Indian families have drawn foreign companies like Walmart, Amazon, Facebook, Nissan and others to invest heavily in a country of aspirational consumers.Anil G. Kumar, a civil engineer, was one of them. Around this time last year, he and his family were about to buy a two-bedroom apartment. But when last year’s lockdown hit, Kumar’s employer, a construction chemicals manufacturer, slashed his salary by half.“Everything turned turtle within a few hours,” he said. Three months later, his job had been eliminated.Now Kumar spends his days in his home in a working-class neighborhood in the western part of Delhi, searching for jobs on LinkedIn and taking care of his son.The family’s middle-class life is now under threat. They survive on the $470-a-month salary Kumar’s wife draws from a private university. Instead of holding a big celebration for their son’s 10th birthday at a restaurant, which would have cost nearly $70, they ordered a cake and a new outfit for about one-fifth the cost. Kumar also canceled his Amazon Prime subscription, which he hadn’t used in a while.“Every day you can’t sit on the laptop,” he said. “At times, you feel depressed.”India’s middle class is central to more than the economy. It fits into India’s broader ambitions to rival China, which has grown faster and more consistently, as a regional superpower.To get there, the Indian government may need to address the people the coronavirus has left behind. Household incomes and overall consumption have weakened, even though the sales of some goods have increased recently because of pent-up demand. Many of the hardest hit come from India’s merchant class, the shopkeepers, stall operators or other small entrepreneurs who often live off the books of a major company.“India is not even discussing poverty or inequality or lack of employment or fall in incomes and consumption,” said Mahesh Vyas, the chief executive of the Center for Monitoring of the Indian Economy. “This needs to change first and foremost,” he said.Most Indians are “tired” and “discouraged” by the lack of jobs, said Vyas, especially low-skilled workers.“Unless this problem is addressed,” he said, “this will be a millstone that will hold back India’s sustained growth.”Anand, the prospective fashion designer, who lives in the industrial hub of Noida in the southeastern Delhi area, found himself at wits' end during last year’s lockdown. The family fell behind on the rent. Two months into the lockdown, he collapsed in what he described as a panic attack.“We did not want to live,” said his wife, Akanksha Chadda, 33, a former operations manager at a luxury retail store who also hasn’t been able to find a job. She sat facing a photograph taken three years ago of her son and daughter sitting on a giant turtle at an amusement park. “I didn’t know if I would wake up the next morning or not.”The days when they could afford muesli for breakfast and pizza for dinner are gone, Anand said. On good days, they get some vegetables and banana for the kids.In January, Chadda sold their 8-year-old son’s bicycle to buy milk, lentils and vegetables. He cried for a solid evening. But she felt she had little choice. She had already sold her jewelry the month before.“When you don’t see a ray of hope,” she said, “you lose it.”",1280,7816,21,134
0,Man charged after ‘carrying axe’ near Buckingham Palace,https://www.breakingnews.ie/world/man-charged-after-carrying-axe-near-buckingham-palace-1111767.html,"A man has been charged after he allegedly wielded an axe near Buckingham Palace in London.

Private security guards working on The Mall were alerted by a member of the public to a man apparently carrying an axe at around 6.30pm on Tuesday.

They challenged and detained the man, who was then arrested by armed Metropolitan Police officers on patrol nearby.

Vladyslav Dryhval, 46, of Lea Bridge Road, Leyton, east London, was charged in the early hours of Thursday with two counts of possession of an offensive weapon and a further count of possession of a bladed article.

He was remanded in custody and will appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court later on Thursday.

Photos posted on Twitter by witnesses at the time appeared to show several officers surrounding the man near the Institute of Contemporary Arts building.

0,reports-multiple-people-shot-at-indianapolis-fedex-facility,https://japantoday.com/category/world/reports-multiple-people-shot-at-indianapolis-fedex-facility,"Eight people were killed in a late-night shooting Thursday at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis, police said, adding that the shooter killed himself.

Several other people were injured when gunfire erupted at the facility near the Indianapolis International Airport, police spokesperson Genae Cook said.

At least four were hospitalized, including one person with critical injuries. Another two people were treated and released at the scene, she said. FedEx said people who worked for the company were among the dead.

A witness told WTHR-TV that he was working inside the building when he heard gunshots.

“I see a man come out with a rifle in his hand and he starts firing and he starts yellin’ stuff that I could not understand,” Levi Miller said. “What I ended up doing was ducking down to make sure he did not see me because I thought he would see me and he would shoot me.”

The shooter wasn't immediately identified, and investigators were in the process of conducting interviews and gathering information. Cook said it was too early to tell whether the shooter was an employee at the facility.

“We’re still trying to ascertain the exact reason and cause for this incident,” she said.

It was the latest in a recent string of mass shootings across the U.S. Last month, eight people were fatally shot at massage businesses across the Atlanta area, and 10 died in gunfire at a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado.

It was at least the third mass shooting this year in Indianapolis alone. Five people, including a pregnant woman, were shot and killed in January, and a man was accused of killing three adults and a child before abducting his daughter during at argument at a home in March.

“I am heartbroken by the mass shooting at the FedEx facility here in Indianapolis and praying for all affected by this tragedy,” Rep. Andre Carson, a Democrat whose district includes much of the city, tweeted.

Police were called to reports of gunfire Thursday just after 11 p.m., and officers “came in contact with (an) active shooter incident,” Cook said. The gunman later killed himself.

“The officers responded, they came in and did their job. A lot of them are trying to face this, because this is a sight that no one should have to see,” Cook said.

FedEx released a statement saying saying it is cooperating with authorities.

“We are deeply shocked and saddened by the loss of our team members following the tragic shooting at our FedEx Ground facility in Indianapolis,"" the statement said. ""Our most heartfelt sympathies are with all those affected by this senseless act of violence.”

Family members gathered at a nearby hotel to await word on loved ones. Some said employees aren’t allowed to have their phones with them while working shifts at the facility, making it difficult to contact them, WTHR-TV reported.

Ashlee Floyd told the Indianapolis Star that her father has worked at the facility for two decades. She said he usually calls his wife around 11:25 p.m. but he didn’t call Thursday, so family tried to contact him but he didn’t respond.

“I don’t know if he’s OK. I don’t know if he’s injured. I don’t know if he’s gone. I’m just scared right now,” she said.

Live video from news outlets at the scene showed crime scene tape in the parking lot outside the facility.

Jeremiah Miller, a witness who said he works at the facility, told WISH-TV that he saw a man with some kind of rifle after hearing several gunshots.

Another man told WTTV that his niece was sitting in the driver's seat of her car when the gunfire erupted, and she was wounded.

“She got shot on her left arm,” said Parminder Singh. “She's fine, she's in the hospital now.”

He said his niece did not know the shooter.

What’s wrong with me?” said Greene, who said that although she knew anyone running for office would have to make some compromises, she wondered how she was going to maintain her anti-pedophile credentials if she willingly worked alongside all the child molesters in Congress. “Only a complete and utter sellout would spend all this time railing against the House of Representatives, one of the centers of the global sex-trafficking ring that President Trump is nobly trying to fight against, and then sign up to join them. Where is my sense of ethics? Try to change things from the inside, I told myself—fat chance. If I could talk to a younger version of myself, all full of hope that we could successfully dismantle the global child-trafficking ring, I just hope she would still respect me.” At press time, an increasingly remorseful Greene was reportedly considering giving her seat up altogether after receiving a call from House minority leader Kevin McCarthy informing her that she would receive an assignment to sit on the House Subcommittee For Adrenochrome Harvesting.

Top, from left to right: Detained Protest leader Ko Wai Moe Naing, actor Zin Wyne, activist Daw Myo Aye. Bottom, from left to right: a final year medical student, singer Po Po, a final year medical student, a dental student.

About three dozen people, including a prominent protest leader, protesters, celebrities, activists and ordinary citizens, were arrested by the military regime on Thursday in four states and regions.

Regime forces arrested six medics during a crackdown on a protest column led by members of the medical community in Mandalay about 10 a.m. Thursday.

A least 20 other people in the neighborhood were arrested during the crackdown. The junta’s forces opened fire and destroyed motorbikes and vehicles.

About 10:30 a.m. the regime’s troops broke into a house in Shan State’s capital, Taunggyi, and arrested four people, according to state-based media.

About 11:30 a.m., workers’ rights activist Daw Myo Aye, director of Solidarity Trade Union of Myanmar (STUM), was abducted from her office in Shwepyithar Township. Four military vehicles with around 40 soldiers surrounded the office during the arrest. Her daughter wrote on her Facebook page that the troops also confiscated the phones of the staff in the office.

Veteran academy-award winning actor Zin Wyne was arrested in afternoon in Yangon. He was charged with allegedly inciting civil servants to join the civil disobedience movement and support the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH).

A group formed by elected parliamentarians ousted in the coup, the CRPH has been acting as a shadow government in opposition to the military regime.

Po Po, a famous singer who was also on junta’s wanted list for the same charge, was arrested about 3 p.m. She was taken from her house in Yangon by regime forces, her manager wrote on social media. Both celebrities participated in anti-regime protests.

Ko Wai Moe Naing, a prominent leader of the anti-regime protest movement in Monywa, Sagaing region, was beaten and dragged away by regime’s forces after having his motor scooter rammed Thursday afternoon. He had been leading daily motorbike protests against the military dictatorship. A female protester was also arrested along with him.

The Monywa People Strike Leading Committee announced after the arrest that they will continue to fight until the fall of the military dictatorship. They also called upon the military regime to respect detainees’ human rights and allow proper medical treatment.

On Tuesday, Ko Zaw Thurein Tun, president of Myanmar Computer Professionals Association in Monywa, and his pregnant wife were abducted together by plainclothes officers in Shwebo Township, Sagaing region.

A former journalist from Myitkyina, a news outlet based in Kachin State, was also arrested by plainclothes officers at her home.

According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which tracks detentions, the regime had detained more than 3,000 people and issued arrest warrants for 756 more.

0,Why is Boris Johnson coming to India?,https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/news/boris-johnson-coming-india,"England sells asylum in the name of democratic legal processes to all sorts of money-laundering thugs whom we seek. Our bilateral political relations have been on a roller coaster for several years. The British government tolerates (possibly even encourages) anti-India sentiments among the Indo-Pakistani diaspora, as a means of pressuring us.

New Delhi: If he does come, then why is Boris Johnson coming to India, his first major international visit after running away from Europe? The number of European leaders making a beeline for India despite the virus reminds one of the rush to Beijing in times gone by.

The citizens of Great Britain, as it used to be called (note the Great) were the world’s greatest empire builders, with almost one quarter of the planet under Britain’s sway at one time. We, Indians, were the world’s greatest empire busters, as we began the process of decolonization that saw the empire collapse. Deep down, many ex-colonials never forgave India for inaugurating the dismantling of the British empire, foremost among them the fellow named after a church on a hilltop, “an unashamed imperialist at a time when imperialism is on its last legs”, as Sardar Patel described him.

Britain, reeling today under its self-goal of quitting the European Union, is desperately seeking an enhanced independent international profile and has still not accepted its dramatically reduced role in global affairs. Fantasy has no cure. Boris Johnson famously said about Africa: “Africa’s problem is not that we were once in charge, but that we are no longer in charge.” As long as it retains a permanent seat in the United Nations, it will continue to fantasize that it is a great power. If UK were not a member of the UNSC, its global influence would be about the same as Somalia’s.

We may expect more nonsense such as the recent discussion on Kashmir or the Citizenship Amendment Act or the farmers’ agitation in the House of Commons and possibly the House of Frauds, sorry Lords.

Times change quickly, mindsets more sluggishly. As the legendary Bob Dylan sang in his 1960s classic:

Your old road is rapidly agin’

Please get out of the new one

If you can’t lend your hand

For the times they are a-changin’

Britain refuses to accept the new road.

In 1947-48, we were attacked by tribal lashkars and soldiers from Britain’s illegitimate child Pakistan led by British officers. In November 1947, under the command of a renegade called Major W.A. Brown who had sworn loyalty to the Maharaja of Kashmir, the Gilgit Scouts overthrew the Maharaja’s Governor in Gilgit, and declared accession to Pakistan. Instead of being court-martialed, he was knighted by the Queen.

By 1956, our foreign exchange reserves held in pound sterling in the Bank of England, had been decimated by the sterling’s devaluation as Britain was in severe financial distress, and we had to pay pensions and make lumpsum recompense to retired British army officers. I recall that in 1965, when we were under pressure on the Kashmir front, we crossed the Punjab border and moved swiftly to Lahore, giving a rude shock to Pakistan, Britain denounced this “naked aggression” against Pakistan, and made similar noises in 1971. In 1991, our Foreign Exchange reserves were just enough for a couple of weeks of imports. We asked our dear former rulers for USD 600 mn to finance some essential imports and were told that we would need to pledge our gold to the Bank of England, which we did.

Till a few years ago, I used to see advertisements in Indian magazines about properties in England. Their property market was sustained by shady fellows from Pakistan, India, Russia, Africa, etc. A former Pakistani Prime Minister is still trying to explain how he was able to afford luxurious properties in London on his salary. So are several Indian businessmen.

England sells asylum in the name of democratic legal processes to all sorts of money-laundering thugs and hoodlums (involved in cricket, airlines and diamonds) whom we seek. This is ironic, considering that Britain pretended to be very active in forming the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in July 1989 at the Group of Seven (G-7) Summit in Paris. Our bilateral political relations have been on a roller coaster for several years. The British government tolerates (possibly even encourages) anti-India sentiments among the Indo-Pakistani diaspora, as a means of pressuring us. Britannia no longer rules the waves, but the waves of atavism rule Britannia.

In one of my postings overseas, my British counterpart complained that his principals were badgering him to get involved in peace negotiations with a rebel group, and to tag along with the US ambassador, so that London could claim some influence in its former colony.

Quitting the European Union will further erode the UK’s global relevance, if it has any left. But it will continue to delude itself that it still determines the destinies of hundreds of millions, as it did for two hundred years. Interestingly, while young India is bursting with energy and enthusiasm, Britain has a Minister for Loneliness.

Any former colony and the former colonial master need three generations to overcome the “colonized” mindset. The first is the transitional generation educated and trained by the masters, so there is an element of nostalgia (while the departing overlords fret over their lost glory). The second generation recalls the exploitation but is largely indifferent, and the third wonders what the “special relationship” is all about.

Those who rule England today had fathers or grandfathers or uncles in the British Indian Civil Service or the military. They have been brought up on stories of the white man’s burden and their glorious lives in British India with huge homes and dozens of servants for “chota hazri” and “bada hazri”

So, Shri Boris Johnson will look for:

The huge Indian market for British products including defence equipment, and Indian vaccines for his country. Indian investment in England. Indian students to save floundering British universities.

In 2021, England needs India more than India ever needed England.

England’s strategy paper released in March 2021, depicts Russia as an active enemy and China as a systemic foe. It promises to send its pitiable navy to the Indian Ocean and to spend money to increase its nuclear arsenal.

In the 1790s, Bertrand Barere, a French revolutionary had called England a “nation of shopkeepers”. Napoleon is supposed to have said to the British: “All your great riches…arose from commerce…It is not…mines of gold, silver, or diamonds…your shops and your trade have made you what you are.” The business of the UK is business. When we bought their fighter jets, everything was hunky dory, but not when we bought something else. India is a major investor in the UK. In recent years there is more Indian money invested in UK than the other way around. According to official estimates, as of 2020, Indian companies in the UK have a turnover of some 50 bn pounds, and employ several hundred thousand people. Tata group alone employs almost 65,000 people in the UK. All hell broke loose in 2011 when Ratan Tata reportedly complained in a newspaper interview that British workers at Jaguar Land Rover and Corus (companies that he had acquired) could not be found in their office after 3.30 pm on Fridays. For good measure he reportedly added that in India workers stayed in the office until midnight if necessary.

India’s Finance Minister’s description in Parliament in 2010 of British aid to India as peanuts, sparked furious media and political debate in England on why the aid was being continued when India preferred the French fighter jet Rafale to the Typhoon, which is partly manufactured in Britain. With considerable difficulty, India managed to persuade the British government to discontinue its assistance from 2015, much to the horror of some Indian NGOs (and their UK Department of Foreign and International Development bosses).

This kind of phenomenon, where non-Western countries impact the West, has been called “reverse colonialism”, and maverick Boris Johnson remarked at a dinner in 2017 (when he was Foreign Secretary) that: “We in the UK are the beneficiaries of reverse colonialism.” He pointed out that Jaguar cars made in UK and exported back to India “in ever growing numbers” incarnated the “commercial role reversal” between India and the UK.

In 2013, then Prime Minister David Cameron led the largest trade delegation with more than 100 representatives from multinational corporations, medium-to-small-sized corporations, and universities to India. Net result zero! A cartoon in the Economist in 2013 after David Cameron’s visit depicted him genuflecting before our then Prime Minister and chairperson of UPA and asking for Indian investment in UK.

Former British PM Theresa May came in 2016 to discuss post-Brexit relations with India, her first bilateral visit to a non-European country since becoming Prime Minister. Explaining the decision, May said: “It [the visit] matters now more than ever. India is the fastest-growing major economy.” Her business delegation signed several MoUs. Nothing happened.

While the two sides have discussed a bilateral free trade agreement, it has not yet been worked on.

In the early years of Independence, thousands of Indians studied in England. Oxford and Cambridge degrees were much coveted, but then were overtaken by US universities. Ten years ago, there was much hype over the UK India Education and Research Initiative (UKIERI). Prime Minister David Cameron said that a higher quality of education would lead to providing opportunities for all, thus encouraging economic growth, and overcoming poverty for India (you see they still think they can alleviate the poverty that they caused in India!). However, the number of Indian students in the UK did not increase owing to tighter rules for international students.

From the 1950s to the 1970s, hundreds of thousands of Indians (especially from Punjab) and others from former British colonies went to the UK in search of economic advancement. They worked hard, with total dedication and determination. “Over-taim” helped them earn much more than their salaries. Today the Indian diaspora in UK is around 2 million and many of them have achieved eminent positions. Over the last 20 years, the number has been reduced to a trickle, thanks to labyrinthine British immigration laws that assume that half the world sees the UK as paradise and is dying to get there.

While researching a project, I came across this gem. At a meeting with his officials in 1946 in Lahore, the egregious and pompous Sir James Glancy ICS (1906 Punjab cadre), governor of Punjab, said: “We would leave very soon but remember that you would not be able to maintain those vaulting standards of fairness, honesty, efficaciousness and diligence in administration, which we maintained…despite difficulties of governing and numerous odds faced by us. Time would come when many of you would remember us with tears in your eyes.” Please, readers, do cry for the glorious years of the British Raj.

And yes, as a gift to India, we will be promised that Nirav Modi will soon be back in India, so Shri Johnson does not have to answer embarrassing questions.

He lives in Indianapolis and he owned a large cache of child pornography. On the other hand, it turns out he’s a pretty good dad, if you discount that whole incident, and he has three brothers who really loved him until this all came out.

1,Doing Their Part: Nintendo Is Encouraging Gamers To Register To Vote And Write In Mario For President,https://ogn.theonion.com/doing-their-part-nintendo-is-encouraging-gamers-to-reg-1845172328,"This is really inspiring, gamers. With the coming election less than five weeks away, we need all hands on deck to make sure our democracy continues to flourish. Thankfully, the gaming legends at Nintendo are doing their part with their new “Switch the Polls” campaign that encourages gamers to register to vote and write in Mario for president.

Democratic engagement FTW!

Here’s how it works: Starting Saturday , October 24, all Nintendo Switch and 3DS users will receive weekly updates informing them about their local voting center, instructions on voter registration, and where to write “Mario” on a ballot to make sure everyone’s favorite plumber’s name is represented in the 2020 election. Beyond that, Nintendo will also be offering free bussing to nearby polls on November 3 in order to ensure no gamer will be prevented from voting for the iconic Italian platforming star to become president. If all goes well, we could even se e the beloved gaming icon beat out Green Party candidate Howie Hawkins!

Given the overall sense of fatigue and hopelessness that has long plagued the nation, we couldn’t be happier to see Nintendo coming out and encouraging everyone to make sure their voices are heard at the polls. After all, this is the most important election in a generation, and it’s downright inspiring to imagine millions of gamers heading to their local election center and showing the world that Mario deserves to be president of the United States. Even more impressive is Nintendo’s choice to also encourage down ballot voting with an ad campaign telling fans to cast their vote in state and local races for Shy Guys. So cool!



Frankly, we think this is a long overdue stand for the iconic console maker. After all, we live in a democracy that requires active participation from all gamers in order for it to continue being healthy and robust. We’re also encouraged that Nintendo is putting their money where their mouth is and telling fans that if Mario doesn’t receive at least 3% of the vote, then the election has been rigged and the director of the FEC should be assassinated.

Now that’s the sort of commitment to democracy that we all love to see!",370,2190,17,101

We know there’s one game left in this generation that’s been getting you more pumped than anything else. In fact, this open-world RPG from CD Projekt Red is probably one of the things that has kept you going through this tough year. But we need to just come clean and get this off our backs: Cyberpunk 2077 is not a real game. It was just something we made up to sound cool and interesting in front of you so you would like us and now that lie is spinning completely out of control.

Please don’t hate us.

Now, we’re sure your mad. We know you were counting down the days until you could explore a fully realized Night City as part of the ultra-customizable gameplay you’ve been seeing in hands-on videos for months. But it’s a lie. It’s all a goddamn lie and we’re sorry. We just really like when you hang out on the site, and we wanted you to stick around. That’s why we made it up way back in 2012 and got the developer to play along.

This started as a dumb little fib about something we thought you would like and now it’s become this huge weight on our chest, getting heavier and heavier every day. We just couldn’t keep it down anymore without having a panic attack.



We know what you are thinking. The screenshots? The previews? Our art department created it all. We thought we could keep up the charade for a year or two more with a trickle of delays and impressions about the gangs, the dynamic police system, all of it. But in the back of our heads, we always knew that one day, you would expect this game to come out and we would be caught.



Some of this is on you. Why do you think it’s been delayed so many times? We flirted with the idea of canceling it all together, saying CD Projekt Red had gone bankrupt or something. But then we would have never been free from the manacles of this lie.



We were just insecure, you know? There are so many video game sites out there and we’ve always kind of felt like outcasts. Talking about Cyberpunk was the first time we ever really felt like we were part of something, like you actually wanted to hear what we had to say. In a way we wanted it to be real—the customizable weapons and slow-motion combat sequences. It all sounded so cool and we didn’t want to let you down. Please don’t blame us. After all, our intentions were good.

We did this for you, even if we only ended up hurting you.

To be fair you probably should have figured it out years ago. The idea of a sci-fi shooter from the makers of The Witcher series was always a bit of a wish fulfillment fantasy wasn’t it? Obviously, we’re not trying to absolve ourselves of this. But we kind of assumed you would catch on when we claimed Keanu Reeves was going to be in the game. That doesn’t make any sense if you just think about it for a second. But we just blurted it out a few months ago, and then all it took was hiring him for a few press appearances and we were in the clear again.

At least, until now.



So, listen, what we are trying to say is: We’re very sorry. This video game is never going to come out. It doesn’t ev en exist. Of course, we understand if you never trust us again to deliver honest coverage of the industry. On the plus side, getting this all out there makes us feel like we can finally breathe again without hating ourselves. We’re sure you’ll need some time to process this, and we could use a little time to ourselves to figure out why we’re like this.

The move has complicated talks aimed at reviving Iran’s nuclear deal with major powers as it is a big step towards producing weapons-grade uranium.

Iran had previously only reached 20 per cent purity, and that was already a breach of the deal, which says Iran can only enrich to 3.67 per cent.

Iran made the step up to 60 per cent in response to an explosion that damaged equipment at the larger, underground Fuel Enrichment Plant at Natanz. Teheran has blamed Israel and named a man wanted in connection with the blast.

“The Agency today verified that Iran had begun the production of UF6 enriched up to 60 per cent... at the (above-ground) Natanz Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement.

UF6 is uranium hexafluoride, the form in which uranium is fed into centrifuges for enrichment.

A confidential IAEA report to member states seen by Reuters provided more details.

“According to Iran’s declaration to the Agency, the enrichment level of the UF6 produced at PFEP was 55.3 per cent U-235.

The Agency took a sample of the produced UF6 for destructive analysis to independently verify the enrichment level declared by Iran. The results of this analysis will be reported by the Agency in due course,” the report said.",253,1520,10,62
0,The EU is considering a ban on AI for mass surveillance and social credit scores,https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383301/eu-ai-regulation-draft-leak-surveillance-social-credit,"The European Union is considering banning the use of artificial intelligence for a number of purposes, including mass surveillance and social credit scores. This is according to a leaked proposal that is circulating online, first reported by Politico, ahead of an official announcement expected next week.

If the draft proposal is adopted, it would see the EU take a strong stance on certain applications of AI, setting it apart from the US and China. Some use cases would be policed in a manner similar to the EU’s regulation of digital privacy under GDPR legislation.

GDPR, but for artificial intelligence

Member states, for example, would be required to set up assessment boards to test and validate high-risk AI systems. And companies that develop or sell prohibited AI software in the EU — including those based elsewhere in the world — could be fined up to 4 percent of their global revenue.

According to a copy of the draft seen by The Verge, the draft regulations include:

A ban on AI for “indiscriminate surveillance,” including systems that directly track individuals in physical environments or aggregate data from other sources

A ban on AI systems that create social credit scores, which means judging someone’s trustworthiness based on social behavior or predicted personality traits

Special authorization for using “remote biometric identification systems” like facial recognition in public spaces

Notifications required when people are interacting with an AI system, unless this is “obvious from the circumstances and the context of use”

New oversight for “high-risk” AI systems, including those that pose a direct threat to safety, like self-driving cars, and those that have a high chance of affecting someone’s livelihood, like those used for job hiring, judiciary decisions, and credit scoring

Assessment for high-risk systems before they’re put into service, including making sure these systems are explicable to human overseers and that they’re trained on “high quality” datasets tested for bias

The creation of a “European Artificial Intelligence Board,” consisting of representatives from every nation-state, to help the commission decide which AI systems count as “high-risk” and to recommend changes to prohibitions

Perhaps the most important section of the document is Article 4, which prohibits certain uses of AI, including mass surveillance and social credit scores. Reactions to the draft from digital rights groups and policy experts, though, say this section needs to be improved.

“The descriptions of AI systems to be prohibited are vague, and full of language that is unclear and would create serious room for loopholes,” Daniel Leufer, Europe policy analyst at Access Now, told The Verge. That section, he says, is “far from ideal.”

Experts say the wording in the draft legislation is unhelpfully vague

Leufer notes that a prohibition on systems that cause people to “behave, form an opinion or take a decision to their detriment” is unhelpfully vague. How exactly would national laws decide if a decision was to someone’s detriment or not? On the other hand, says Leufer, the prohibition against AI for mass surveillance is “far too lenient.” He adds that the prohibition on AI social credit systems based on “trustworthiness” is also defined too narrowly. Social credit systems don’t have to assess whether someone is trustworthy to decide things like their eligibility for welfare benefits.

On Twitter, Omer Tene, vice president of nonprofit IAPP (The International Association of Privacy Professionals), commented that the regulation “represents the typical Brussels approach to new tech and innovation. When in doubt, regulate.” If the proposals are passed, said Tene, it will create a “vast regulatory ecosystem,” which would draw in not only the creators of AI systems, but also importers, distributors, and users, and create a number of regulatory boards, both national and EU-wide.

This ecosystem, though, wouldn’t primarily be about restraining “big tech,” says Michael Veale, a lecturer in digital rights and regulations at University College London. “In its sights are primarily the lesser known vendors of business and decision tools, whose work often slips without scrutiny by either regulators or their own clients,” Veale tells The Verge. “Few tears will be lost over laws ensuring that the few AI companies that sell safety-critical systems or systems for hiring, firing, education and policing do so to high standards. Perhaps more interestingly, this regime would regulate buyers of these tools, for example to ensure there is sufficiently authoritative human oversight.”

It’s not known what changes might have been made to this draft proposal as EU policymakers prepare for the official announcement on April 21st. Once the regulation has been proposed, though, it will be subject to changes following feedback from MEPs and will have to be implemented separately in each nation-state.

Mark Lowcock told a closed-door meeting of the U.N. Security Council that his office is starting to receive reports of people starving to death, according to a copy of his remarks seen by VOA.

Ofla woreda, in Tigray

""We received the first report this week of four internally displaced people dying from hunger. I then received a report just this morning of 150 people dying from hunger in Ofla woreda [district] — just south of Mekelle,"" Lowcock told council members. ""This should alarm us all. It is a sign of what lies ahead if more action is not taken. Starvation as a weapon of war is a violation.""

Mekelle is the capital of Tigray. The region has been the epicenter of hostilities since November, when fighters from the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) attacked federal government army bases in the region, according to the federal government. The attack, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said, prompted his government to launch a military offensive to push the group out.

Abandoned villages

Lowcock said that as of the end of March, Ethiopia's Bureau of Labor and Social Affairs estimates that 1.7 million people in Tigray have been displaced from their homes.

FILE - A woman leans on the wall of a damaged house that was shelled as federal-aligned forces entered the city, in Wukro, north of Mekelle, capital of Tigray. The region has been beset by hostilities since November.

""Since then, hundreds of thousands have been fleeing from Western Tigray — and still are — with many villages having been abandoned entirely,"" he said.

Lowcock said aid workers are having difficulty reaching the needy and vulnerable, as ""the vast majority"" of Tigray is completely or partially inaccessible to aid workers, either because of fighting or denial of access.

The outbreak of hostilities began around harvest season, and it follows a severe locust infestation. Food insecurity is growing, and next season's food supply is also under threat if fighting does not stop in time for farmers to plant.

The United Nations estimates that at least 4.5 million of Tigray's nearly 6 million people need humanitarian aid. The Ethiopian government has put the figure even higher — at 91% of the population.

Despite obstacles and danger, humanitarians have been able to reach more than 1.7 million with some form of emergency assistance.

Next week, the U.N. will appeal for $1.5 billion to assist 16 million people in Ethiopia this year.

No sign of withdrawal

On March 26, Abiy said Eritrea had agreed to withdraw its forces from Tigray, but Lowcock told council members there is no evidence this has happened.

""Unfortunately, I must say that neither the U.N. nor any of the humanitarian agencies we work with have seen proof of Eritrean withdrawal,"" he said. ""We have, however, heard some reports of Eritrean soldiers now wearing Ethiopian Defense Force uniforms.""

The U.S. ambassador issued a statement following the closed-door meeting, noting credible reports that Eritrean forces are changing into Ethiopian military uniforms ""in order to remain in Tigray indefinitely.""

""The Eritrean government must withdraw its forces from Ethiopia immediately,"" Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said.

Reports of atrocities

Lowcock said humanitarian workers continue to report new atrocities committed by Eritrean forces. Most alarming, he said, are the widespread reports of rapes and gang rapes against civilians.

Diplomats said the U.N. humanitarian chief recounted the horrific story of one survivor, who hid in the forest with her family for six days. During that time, she gave birth to a baby who died a few days later. Her husband was killed. And while she tried to get her remaining children to safety, she encountered four Eritrean soldiers who raped her in front of her children all night and into the following day.

""The majority of rapes are committed by men in uniform,"" Lowcock told council members. ""Cases reported have involved the Ethiopian National Defense Force, Eritrean Defense Forces, Amhara Special Forces, and other irregular armed groups or aligned militia.""

During a Wednesday meeting of the Security Council that focused on the issue of sexual violence in conflict, many council members expressed concern about reports coming from Tigray and called for independent, credible investigations to be conducted to hold perpetrators accountable.

The U.N. official whose office monitors and works to prevent sexual violence in conflict, Pramila Patten, told that meeting that more than 100 allegations of rape have been recorded since November.

""It may be many months before we know the full scale and magnitude — the extent and impact — of these atrocities,"" she said.

Patten noted health care workers are documenting new cases of rape and gang rape daily, ""despite their fear of reprisals and attacks on the limited shelters and clinics still in operation.""",860,5365,7,44

“India has stood firm on the northern borders, and we have proven that we will not get pushed. In whatever we have been able to achieve in standing firm, in preventing a change of status quo, we have been able to gather world support,” CDS Rawat while speaking at the Raisina Dialogue series.

Rawat said that China feels that “they have arrived, they have a superior armed force, because of the tech advances that they have”. China, he said, has been “able to create disruptive technologies which can paralyse systems of the adversary” which is why, “they feel just by doing a little bit of shove and push, they will be able to compel nations to give in to their demands”.

“They have tried to ensure that they can change the status quo by the use of disruptive technology, without using force. As of now they have not used force. They thought that India as a nation will succumb to the pressures that they are putting on us, because of the tech advances that they have.” Rawat said.

But the “international community” has come to India’s support to say, he said, “that yes there is an international rules-based order, which every nation must follow”. That, Rawat said, “is what we have been able to achieve, and that is what we are trying to gather support from the other international nations”.

He said globally the situation is changing and “geopolitics coupled with the geo-economics is indeed seeking to reshape the rules that govern the world order”. There are some nations, he said, that follow the international order while others depend on their own law, “they make their own rules and regulations, try and change the status quo”.

“These kinds of things do lead to conflict situation, and that is what we are witnessing on our northern borders,” he said.

Changes in geopolitics are “shaped by a nation-first approach” as “today nations feel that we need to authoritatively pressurise other nations if they can, and that is what is leading to a changing security situation” Rawat stated.

He said soon adversaries “may get embroiled into conflict, with one of the other nations even being unaware, that they are actually in conflict”.

“Nations are trying to become assertive. And this is what, I think, China attempted to say that it is my way or no other way. But I think, such nature of undeclared war, will place dilemma in the minds of decision-makers, whether or not to resort to kinetic force, and thus be labelled as an aggressor.”

“While militaries around the world are seeking innovative systems to enhance their combat capabilities, disruptive tech on the other hand will compel nations to rethink their concept doctrines and techniques of warfighting,” he added.

He expressed satisfaction at international cooperation, saying that “We are very satisfied in the way the international community is coming together to coordinate their efforts to ensure that authoritarian regimes do not have their way around, and that everybody follows the rules-based international order”.

Talking about the exit of US and NATO forces from Afghanistan, Rawat said that India has “concerns about Afghanistan” and would “like to see peace and tranquillity returning to that region”.

If exit of the US and NATO forces will lead to peace, “we would be happy to see such a situation emerging”, he said. “But our concern is that the vacuum that is going to be created with the withdrawal of US and NATO, should not create space for other disruptors to step in, therefore the violence continues in Afghanistan.”

He said India will be “very happy to provide whatever support we can in the development of Afghanistan, and making sure that ultimately peace returns to that nation,” adding that “there are many nations that are willing to step into Afghanistan”.",673,3978,12,66

(Arizona State University's Center for Global Discovery and Conservation Science, Allen Coral Atlas via AP)

HONOLULU (AP) — As muddy rainwater surged from Hawaii’s steep seaside mountains and inundated residential communities last month, the damage caused by flooding was obvious — houses were destroyed and businesses swamped, landslides covered highways and raging rivers and streams were clogged with debris.

But extreme rain events predicted to become more common with human-caused global warming not only wreak havoc on land — the runoff from these increasingly severe storms also threatens Hawaii’s coral reefs.

“These big events are the ones that have the greatest damage because they are the ones that put the most sediment and nutrients out onto the reef,” said C. Mark Eakin, senior coral advisor to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the former director of the agency’s Coral Reef Watch program.

A warmer climate tends to amplify existing weather patterns, said Hawaii’s state climatologist, Pao-Shin Chu, noting the islands have an overall wet climate and that powerful storms are expected to become more frequent.

“Given this climate change or global warming, as we have seen over the last hundred years, the atmospheric water vapor pressure is increasing,” said Chu. “We have some evidence showing that we already have some increasing, very intense rain.”

Coral reefs make up much of Hawaii’s nearshore ocean ecosystem and are critical to the state’s economy.

Hawaii’s reefs protect populated shorelines from massive ocean swells and storm surges from tropical storms — a benefit the U.S. Geological Survey valued at more than $860 million a year.

Adding tourism, fishing, cultural value and other factors, the state’s reefs are worth more than $33 billion , according to a NOAA-funded study.

March’s flooding was caused by a weather system that stalled over the islands and brought two weeks of rain, much extremely heavy.

On Oahu’s North Shore, “a very large flood wave” rushed down from the mountains and flooded the town of Haleiwa, said National Weather Service hydrologist Kevin Kodama.

“That’s a big challenge in Hawaii, where we have small, steep watersheds,” Kodama said. “Most of the basins in the state will produce flash flooding.”

Last month had 11 flash flood events and was the wettest March in 15 years, he said.

The runoff problem is multifaceted. Deforestation and grading on construction sites and farms lead to increased runoff. Feral animals such as goats, pigs and deer clear vegetation, causing erosion and excessive sedimentation on reefs. And constant, low-level runoff carries gasoline and oil from roadways, household chemicals, trash and pesticides into the ocean.

Any significant change in ocean conditions, such as an influx of fresh water alone, can harm coral health. Contaminants and soil from land accumulate on reefs and can smother and kill the coral. Scientists say suspension of material in the water can also block sunlight coral needs to survive.

One of the biggest problems for Hawaii reefs is sewage. There are about 88,000 cesspools throughout the islands, many in coastal areas.

“Cesspools are essentially a hole in the ground where there is no treatment prior to wastewater entering the environment,” said Jamison Gove, a research oceanographer with NOAA who lives on Oahu’s North Shore.

Cesspools leak into groundwater — and with heavy rains, they overflow and send pathogens and other harmful contaminants into the ocean.

In the town of Pupukea, where professional surfers compete at the famed Banzai Pipeline reef break, more than 330 million gallons (1.25 billion liters) of wastewater enters the ocean each year — enough to fill hundreds of Olympic size swimming pools.

On the North Shore during the recent flood, “brown, polluted water just blanketed the entire town,” Gove said. “You could just smell it everywhere.”

More than half the state’s cesspools are on the Big Island, home to some of the state’s most expansive and pristine coral reefs. And Gove said some areas have shown a clear decrease in coral cover where sewage routinely enters the ocean.

A reef off the town of Puako — an extensively monitored location — has seen significant losses, he said. Coral cover there has declined by about 70% since 1975.

“This is probably one of the more dramatic examples since coral cover is not this high in a lot of places,” he said. “But since we don’t have this type of data everywhere, we can’t say for sure this isn’t a more common story.”

NOAA is providing data on the issue to the state, and efforts to remove cesspools and change infrastructure to slow and distribute floodwater could help Hawaii’s reefs.

The state has banned cesspools in new construction and is attempting to remove the existing ones by 2050.

Although coral reefs worldwide face threats from global warming, including marine heatwaves that bleach and kill coral, storm runoff could prove a more serious and immediate threat to reefs in Hawaii.

“In Hawaii, I would rate runoff much higher than marine heatwaves in driving coral decline,” said Greg Asner, director of the Center for Global Discovery and Conservation Science at Arizona State University.

In 2019, Asner and his team used imaging technology on aircraft coupled with satellite data to create new detailed maps of all living coral in the Hawaiian Islands. The data, now being used by federal and state scientists, shows a correlation between land-based pollutants from runoff and coral health.

“More runoff impacts reefs, mostly by mobilizing more chemicals and sediment on land,” Asner said. “Increased chemical pollution and sedimentation is a major driver of coral decline.”

March’s floods were not the first of their kind.

A 2018 rainstorm on Kauai caused widespread flooding that cut off a community for weeks. The storm set a new U.S. record for rainfall in a single day with nearly 50 inches (127 centimeters).

Ku’ulei Rodgers, a coral reef ecologist at the University of Hawaii’s Institute of Marine Biology, studied that 2018 flood as well as a 2002 flood in the same area. The 2002 rains swept earth from a construction site into the sea and “killed almost an entire reef,” Rodgers said.

After the 2018 flood, a review found fish abundance on a nearby reef had been reduced by 20% and urchins, which help clean reefs and keep coral healthy, were reduced by 40%.

When making policy decisions about how to safeguard reefs, Rodgers said, it’s important to understand that land and oceans are intertwined.

″(Native) Hawaiians knew there was a connection between the two because whatever they did upland would affect their fishing downstream,” she said. “The better the watershed, the better the reef and vice versa.”

Many Indian hospitals were scrambling for beds and oxygen as COVID-19 infections surged to a new daily record on Thursday, with a second wave of infections centred on the rich western state of Maharashtra.

India's tally of total infections is second only to the United States, with experts blaming everything from official complacency to aggressive variants. The government has blamed failure to practise physical distancing.

The country has been producing oxygen at full capacity for each of the last two days but will have to turn to imports, with the health ministry saying it was planning to import 50,000 metric tons.

""The situation is horrible,"" said Avinash Gawande, an official at a government hospital in the industrial city of Nagpur that was battling a flood of patients, as were hospitals in neighbouring Gujarat state and New Delhi in the north.

""We are a 900-bed hospital, but there are about 60 patients waiting and we don't have space for them.""

Maharashtra, home to the financial capital of Mumbai, began a lockdown at midnight on Wednesday, a move that spurred a rush to stockpile essential items in advance. The state, the country's most industrial, has been the worst affected by the pandemic.

At Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan (LNJP) Hospital in New Delhi, the country's largest facility treating COVID-19 patients, two or three patients were seen sharing single beds in some wards, a Reuters witness said. read more

COVID-positive patients - from a one-and-a-half-year-old toddler to many elderly - and their relatives kept streaming in to the emergency ward at LNJP, arriving by ambulance, car or auto-rickshaw throughout the day.

""Last year also we have not seen such a bad situation. This time the number is very high and increasing very rapidly, going (at a) very fast speed, so the situation is really alarming,"" said LNJP Medical Director Suresh Kumar.

""We are definitely overburdened... Today we have 158 admissions in Lok Nayak alone. All sick patients, all severe patients,"" Kumar added.

India has added 200,739 infections over the last 24 hours, health ministry data showed, for a seventh daily record surge in the last eight days, while 1,038 deaths took its toll to 173,123.

Despite injecting the third highest number of vaccines doses worldwide, India has covered only a small part of its 1.4 billion people.

India said on Thursday regulators would decide on emergency-use applications for foreign COVID-19 vaccines within three working days. India's ambassador to Moscow said deliveries of Russia's Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine to India were expected to begin before the end of April, the TASS news agency reported.

Forty-year-old Prashant Mehra said he had to pay a broker for preferential treatment before he could get his 90-year-old grandfather admitted to an overstretched government hospital.

""He died after six or seven hours,"" he said.

Supplies of oxygen ran short in places such as Gujarat, the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

""If such conditions persist, the death toll will rise,"" the head of a medical body in the industrial city of Ahmedabad told its chief minister in a letter.

Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries (RELI.NS) will supply 100 metric tonnes of additional oxygen to Maharashtra, a state minister said.

New Delhi (AFP)

A Hindu seer has died from coronavirus and 80 other holy men have tested positive after attending a vast Indian religious festival where millions of pilgrims have been ignoring Covid-19 advice despite a national surge in infections.

The announcement from authorities in Haridwar, Uttarakhand state, came as India recorded more than 217,000 fresh cases in the past 24 hours, taking the total number of new infections to more than two million since April 1.

The festival of Kumbh Mela has long rung alarm bells among health experts who say it could turn into a ""super-spreader"" as pilgrims return home to their towns and villages all across India.

A gathering on the banks of the holy River Ganges in Haridwar happens every 12 years, and has attracted as many as 25 million people to the site since January, including some 4.6 million on two auspicious days this week alone.

The enormous crowds of pilgrims -- including cannabis-smoking holy men with dreadlocks -- taking a dip in the river have mostly ignored official advice to maintain distancing.

Earlier this week, Mahamandaleshwar Kapil Dev Das, 65, head of one of the Hindu akhadas or ascetic councils, was admitted to hospital and died from coronavirus on Thursday, officials said.

""We had around 2,000 positive cases since Monday during random testing of pilgrims at the Kumbh,"" Harbeer Singh, a top festival officer, told AFP.

""We are taking precautions and urging people to adhere to coronavirus prevention behaviours.""

The officer said they had ramped up testing at the event's 600-hectare (1,500-acre) site and insisted they were strictly enforcing government protocols, including requiring negative virus certificates.

Two of the 13 Hindu ascetic councils that are part of the major get-together have now pulled out over soaring Covid cases in the city.

Singh said more than 25,000 pilgrims were still visiting every day and they were expecting 2-3 million devotees on the last grand bathing event on April 27 before the festival concludes.

The Uttarakhand state government has exempted the event from restrictions limiting gatherings to 200 people.

State Chief Minister Tirath Singh Rawat said in early April that no devotees would be ""unnecessarily harassed in the name of Covid-19 restrictions"".

He too later tested positive for the virus, which has so far killed almost 175,000 Indians and infected 14.3 million, the second most in the world after the United States.

Meanwhile, the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, home to some 240 million people, on Friday became the latest to announce restrictions on gatherings, calling a day-long lockdown on Sunday with fines of 1,000 rupees (US $14) for failing to wear a mask.

Saint Petersburg (AFP)

Russia on Saturday said it would expel a Ukrainian diplomat, prompting an immediate pledge of retaliation from Kiev, further escalating tensions over Moscow's troop build-up on Ukraine's eastern flank.

The detention of a Ukrainian consul in the second city Saint Petersburg comes at a time of global concern of a repeat of Moscow's 2014 aggression, when Russia annexed the peninsula of Crimea and backed separatists in Ukraine's east.

Moscow claimed the Ukrainian diplomat had been caught ""red-handed"" trying to obtain sensitive information.

In response, the Ukrainian foreign ministry protested ""the illegal"" detention of its diplomat and said Kiev would expel a senior Russian diplomat.

Kiev has been battling Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine since 2014 and clashes intensified early this year, effectively shredding a ceasefire agreed last July.

Around 30 Ukrainian troops have been killed since the start of the year, compared to 50 last year. Most of them were victims of sniper fire.

Russia has detained a number of Ukrainian nationals on suspicion of spying in recent years but the arrest of a diplomat is rare.

""A Ukrainian diplomat, a consul of Ukraine's Consulate General in Saint Petersburg, Alexander Sosonyuk, has been detained by Russia's FSB,"" the security service said in a statement, using the Russian language spelling of his name.

He was held on Friday, the security service said. Kiev said the diplomat had spent several hours in detention.

The Russian foreign ministry said Saturday it had summoned Ukraine's charge d'affaires Vasyl Pokotylo and told him that the Ukrainian diplomat had 72 hours to leave the country ""beginning April 19"".

""The Russian side pointed to the inadmissibility of such kind of activity,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement.

Russia's domestic intelligence agency said Sosonyuk had been caught ""red-handed"" during a meeting with a Russian national as he sought to receive ""classified"" information.

""Such activity is not compatible with his diplomatic status and is clearly hostile in nature towards the Russian Federation,"" the FSB said.

""In conformity with international law, measures will be taken against the foreign diplomat.""

- 'Crude violations' -

In Kiev, the Ukrainian foreign ministry said it protested the diplomat's detention and rejected Russia's accusations.

Foreign ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said Russia had ""crudely"" violated diplomatic conventions and sought to escalate tensions.

""In response to the above-mentioned provocation, a senior diplomat of the Russian embassy in Kiev must leave Ukrainian territory within 72 hours beginning April 19,"" Nikolenko told AFP. He did not provide further details.

Faced with the largest deployment of Russian troops on Ukraine's borders since 2014, President Volodymyr Zelensky has requested more help from the West, and Western leaders have urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop intimidating Ukraine.

Tensions between Russia and Ukraine come against the background of a new war of words between Moscow and Washington as new US President Joe Biden seeks a tougher line against Putin.

The US on Thursday announced sanctions and the expulsion of 10 Russian diplomats in retaliation for what the White House says is the Kremlin's US election interference, a massive cyber attack and other hostile activity.

Russia said Friday it would expel US diplomats and sanction US officials in response while recommending the US envoy leave Russia ""for consultations"".

MOSCOW (AP) — Russia on Friday responded to a barrage of new U.S. sanctions by saying it would expel 10 U.S. diplomats and take other retaliatory moves in a tense showdown with Washington.

The Russian Foreign Ministry also published a list of eight current or former U.S. officials barred from entering the country, including U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, FBI Director Christopher Wray, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas.

Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also said Moscow will move to shut down those U.S. nongovernment organizations that remain in Russia to end what he described as their meddling in Russia’s politics.

The top Russian diplomat said the Kremlin suggested that U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan follow the example of his Russian counterpart and head home for consultations. Russia will also deny the U.S. Embassy the possibility of hiring personnel from Russia and third countries as support staff, limit visits by U.S. diplomats serving short-term stints at the embassy, and tighten requirements for U.S. diplomats’ travel in the country.

The others banned from entering Russia are Susan Rice, a former U.N. ambassador and now head of the Domestic Policy Council; John Bolton, who was a national security adviser under former President Donald Trump; James Woolsey, a former CIA director; and Michael Carvajal, director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

On Thursday, the Biden administration announced sanctions on Russia for interfering in the 2020 U.S. presidential election and involvement in the SolarWind hack of federal agencies — activities Moscow has denied. The U.S. ordered 10 Russian diplomats expelled, targeted dozens of companies and people, and imposed new curbs on Russia’s ability to borrow money.

While the U.S. wields the power to cripple Russia’s economy, Moscow lacks levers to respond in kind, although it could hurt American interests in other ways globally.

Lavrov called Washington’s move “absolutely unfriendly and unprovoked,” and he said that while Russia could take “painful measures” against American business interests in Russia, it wouldn’t immediately move to do that and “save them for future use.”

He warned that if Washington further raises the pressure, Russia might ask the U.S. to reduce the number of its embassy and consular staff from about 450 to 300. He said both countries host about 450 diplomats, but that includes some 150 Russians at the U.N. in New York that he argued shouldn’t be included.

Russia’s economic potential and its global reach are limited compared with the Soviet Union that competed with the U.S for international influence during the Cold War. Still, Russia’s nuclear arsenal and its leverage in many parts of the world make it a power that Washington needs to reckon with.

Aware of that, President Joe Biden called for de-escalating tensions and held the door open for cooperation with Russia in certain areas. Biden said he told Putin in Tuesday’s call that he chose not to impose tougher sanctions for now and proposed to meet in a third country in the summer.

Lavrov said Russia had a “positive attitude” to the summit offer and was analyzing it, but a statement issued by the Foreign Ministry shortly after noted that it ”was being studied in the context of the evolving situation.”

The ministry charged that Russia would like to avoid further escalation and engage in a “calm and professional dialogue,” but has other means to retaliate if Washington tries to crank up the pressure.

While the new U.S. sanctions further limited Russia’s ability to borrow money by banning U.S. financial institutions from buying Russian government bonds directly from state institutions, they didn’t target the secondary market.

“It’s very important that there’re no sanctions on secondary debt because that means that non-U.S. persons can buy the debt and sell it to the U.S. persons,” said Tom Adshead, director of research at Macro-Advisory Ltd, an analytics and advisory company.

Timothy Frye, a Columbia University political scientist, noted that Biden chose not to target the prospective Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline to Germany or go after large Russian state-controlled companies.

“That’s part of the broader strategy of using sanctions but also reaching out to the Kremlin to propose talks on strategic stability and eventually on a summit,” he said.

Tougher restrictions would also hurt Western businesses, inflict significant economic pain on ordinary Russians and allow Putin to rally anti-U.S. sentiments to shore up his rule.

Ramping up sanctions could eventually drive Russia into a corner and provoke even more reckless Kremlin action, leading to a potential escalation in Ukraine, which has seen a surge in clashes with Russia-backed separatists in the east and a massive Russian troop buildup across the border.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was in Paris on Friday to discuss the tensions with French President Emmanuel Macron. After a joint call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the three urged Russia to pull back its troops to de-escalate the situation.

Fyodor Lukyanov, a top foreign policy expert who leads the Moscow-based Council for Foreign and Defense Policies, predicted Putin would likely accept Biden’s invitation to join next week’s call on climate change but could drag his feet on the summit offer.

“There is no way to make any deals,” Lukyanov said. “There is a mutual antipathy and a total lack of trust.”

He said the only practical outcome of the summit could be an agreement to launch long and difficult talks on a replacement to the New START nuclear reduction agreement that Russia and the U.S. extended in February for another five years.

Lukyanov noted that the growing U.S. pressure will push Russia and China closer in the long run.

“Closer cooperation with China on coordinating actions to contain the United States will develop more quickly now as the Chinese are interested in that,” he said. While Russia lacks tools for a symmetrical answer to the U.S. sanctions, “it has ample capabilities to stimulate changes in the world order,” he added.

Konstantin Kosachev, the Kremlin-connected deputy speaker of the upper house of parliament, said that by imposing sanctions and proposing a summit at the same time, the U.S. sought to take a commanding stance.

“Russia’s consent would be interpreted as a reflection of its desire to soften the sanctions, allowing the U.S. to secure a dominant position at the meeting, while our refusal to meet would be a convenient pretext for more punitive measures,” Kosachev wrote on Facebook.

He argued that Russia should not rush to accept Biden’s summit offer.

“Revenge is a dish best served cold,” Kosachev wrote. “I believe the saying is quite adaptable to a situation when we talk not about revenge but a due answer to aggressive action by an opponent.”

Some predicted the U.S. sanctions could discourage Russia from cooperating with the U.S. on international crises.

“The Russian position will grow tougher on Syria, the Iranian nuclear deal and other issues,” Ivan Timofeev, program director at Russian International Affairs Council, said in a commentary. Instead of acting as a deterrent, he warned, the sanctions would “only anger Russia and make its policy even tougher.”

But despite the soaring tensions, Russia and the U.S. have shared interests in many global hot spots. For example, Moscow fears that instability could spread from Afghanistan to former Soviet republics in Central Asia, and it is interested in a political settlement there.

As for Iran, Moscow also doesn’t want to see it with nuclear weapons, despite its friendly ties with Tehran.

Lukyanov said Russia wouldn’t try to use global hot spots to hurt the U.S. and would wait patiently to see them erode U.S. domination.

“It’s not a matter of playing the spoiler here or there,” he said. “The ongoing developments will help accelerate the process of consolidation of leading powers against the U.S. domination.”

LOS ALTOS, Calif. (AP) — Charles “Chuck” Geschke — the co-founder of the major software company Adobe Inc. who helped develop Portable Document Format technology, or PDFs — died at age 81.

Geschke, who lived in the San Francisco Bay Area suburb of Los Altos, died Friday, the company said.

“This is a huge loss for the entire Adobe community and the technology industry, for whom he has been a guide and hero for decades,” Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen wrote in an email to the company’s employees.

“As co-founders of Adobe, Chuck and John Warnock developed groundbreaking software that has revolutionized how people create and communicate,” Narayen said. “Their first product was Adobe PostScript, an innovative technology that provided a radical new way to print text and images on paper and sparked the desktop publishing revolution. Chuck instilled a relentless drive for innovation in the company, resulting in some of the most transformative software inventions, including the ubiquitous PDF, Acrobat, Illustrator, Premiere Pro and Photoshop.”

His wife said Geschke was also proud of his family.

“He was a famous businessman, the founder of a major company in the U.S. and the world, and of course he was very, very proud of that and it was huge achievement in his life, but it wasn’t his focus — really, his family was,” Nancy “Nan” Geschke, 78, told the Mercury News on Saturday . “He always called himself the luckiest man in the world.”

After earning a doctorate from Carnegie Mellon University, Geschke began working at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, where he met Warnock, the Mercury News reported. The men left the company in 1982 to found Adobe, developing software together.

In 2009, President Barack Obama awarded Geschke and Warnock the National Medal of Technology.

“In his latest post, Q told us we must all come together under a Biden presidency in order to heal the nation, and while that may be a nice sentiment, I’m not sure if he wants us to just set aside all the stuff we believe about Democrats or what,” said local QAnon adherent Jeff White, who expressed the confusion plaguing many in his group when he asked how he was supposed to put his respect for the democratic process above his conviction that Biden belonged to a party of devil-worshipping, child-molesting cannibals. “Q’s saying that whether you’re a red-pilled freedom fighter who serves the Lord or a pedophile who drinks the blood of infants, we’re all Americans at the end of the day. In other words, sure, Joe Biden is enabling homicidal Satanists, but he’s still the person voters have chosen as their president, and you have to respect him.”

“That may sound a little crazy, but maybe Q’s right,” he continued. “Maybe if we want to make this country a better place, we have to find common ground with people who don’t necessarily share our views on the need to bring about ‘the Storm’ and stop global elites from consuming the flesh of children they traffic for sex. Look, I’m not a Biden fan, but I did notice Hillary never campaigned for him—that means there’s a good chance he had her executed, which would be a promising development for our cause.”

According to sources, most QAnon fellows were disappointed President Trump had lost reelection, but were holding out hope that John F. Kennedy Jr. would soon land his plane in Wilmington, DE and agree to head up Biden’s transition team.",325,1910,13,94

This week, multiple tech executives offered their own dismal estimates as part of their usual public financial disclosures, with the worst one coming in at ""a couple of years.""

That nasty estimate comes from Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, who offered that vague timeframe to The Washington Post in an interview on Tuesday. He clarified that was an estimate for how long it would take the company to ""build capacity"" to potentially address supply shortages. The conversation came as Intel offered to step up for two supply chains particularly pinched by the silicon drought: medical supplies and in-car computer systems.

In previous statements, Gelsinger pointed to Intel's current $20 billion plan to build a pair of factories in Arizona, and this week's interview added praise for President Joe Biden's proposed $50 billion chip-production infrastructure plan—though Gelsinger indicated that Biden should be ready to spend more than that.

TSMC CEO C.C. Wei offered a similarly dire estimate to investors on Thursday, saying that the Taiwan-based company hoped to ""offer more capacity"" for meeting retail and manufacturing demand ""in 2023."" TSMC, coincidentally, is moving forward with a manufacturing plant of its own in Arizona, which Bloomberg claims could cost ""up to $12 billion,"" despite the company clarifying that it intends to prioritize research, development, and production in its home nation.

Graphics card and SoC producer Nvidia joined the grim estimate club this week , though Nvidia has a more optimistic belief that it will emerge with ""sufficient supply to support sequential growth beyond [fiscal] Q1 [2022],"" according to CFO Colette Kress. Until then, ""we expect demand to continue to exceed supply for much of this year,"" she added. (Having seen the comment sections of recent GPU reviews at Ars Technica , we sure believe that.)

But as tech companies scramble to navigate natural disasters, exponential consumer demand, and the building of brand-new facilities, some questions remain unanswered. How will so much scaling up of new factories turn out? Will they meet their construction deadlines, and will they be anywhere near as efficient as promised or hoped once their lines open up?

0,Indian double mutation variant arrives in Britain and has 'hallmarks of very dangerous virus',https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-indian-double-mutation-variant-arrives-in-britain-and-has-hallmarks-of-very-dangerous-virus-12276922,"The new Indian variant of the COVID virus that's been detected in the UK has all the hallmarks of a very dangerous virus.

It has two new significant mutations in the spike protein that help it infect cells and evade the immune system.

New figures from Public Health England (PHE) show there have been 73 cases detected in England and another four in Scotland.

The variant - officially named B.1.617 - is almost certainly playing a part in the very sharp spike in the epidemic in India.

Live COVID updates from across the UK and around the world

It has been detected in at least five Indian states that are hotspots for the surge, with more than 200,000 new cases of COVID detected nationwide on Wednesday.

One of the concerning mutations, called L452R, is also found in a variant circulating in California, though there is no link between the viruses. The Indian variant has evolved independently.

The other mutation in the virus is completely new. It is at the same '484' position in the spike protein that is also mutated in the South African variant, and some others. But the actual mutation - E484Q - is slightly different.

Lab tests show both mutations help the virus to infect human cells and evade some antibodies.

Image: Millions of devotees continued to take part in Kumbh Mela, in India, this week despite the pandemic.

The combination - called a double mutant - is a particular concern.

As yet it is unknown what impact they would have on the effectiveness of the existing vaccines.

The discovery of so many cases of the Indian variant in the UK highlights the flaw in relying on a traffic light system for controlling international spread of potentially dangerous viruses.

India is not on the red list so there is no requirement for hotel quarantine. Instead returning travellers are required to take two COVID tests and quarantine at home for 10 days.

But if people don't fully quarantine there is a risk of the virus escaping.

Research shows the South African variant was brought into the country several times before travellers from some African countries were told they had to quarantine in a hotel.

And latest PHE figures show there have been 56 more cases of the South African variant detected in the UK in the last week as the virus continues to spread, with the total now 600.

0,A Small Island Suddenly Emerges In Indonesia Following Seroja Cyclone Thunderstorm,https://worldofbuzz.com/a-small-island-suddenly-emerges-in-indonesia-following-seroja-cyclone-thunderstorm/,"Share Tweet Follow us on Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, and Instagram for the latest stories and updates daily.

A new small island has suddenly emerged in the district of Loaholu in East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia last Wednesday (14 April 2021) after severe thunderstorm hit the region caused by the Seroja Tropical Cyclone. As reported by Indonesia News, local provincial authorities have begun to take note of the new island which is yet to be identified.

Previously, several videos have shown locals visiting the small island which is filled with sand that wasn’t there prior to the Seroja Cyclone. The length of the small island is approximately 500 metres. Josef Nae Soi, the governor of East Nusa Tenggara during a news conference commented,

“There was land that suddenly appeared as if on top of the ocean.”

However, the governor further clarified that more study must be made before concluding what the land actually is. According to a report by Kompas, the appearance of the new island is the subject of many speculations and a geological study must be made on the phenomenon.

A spokesman of the East Nusa Tenggara regional government, Marius Ardu Jelamu clarified that the new island is yet to be officially reported by the local authorities there and that he only knew about it through news reports. He further commented that one theory regarding the new island is that it was born as a result of huge waves and tornado when Seroja Cyclone hit.

Marius added,

“Maybe when the tornado hit, a void was created on the ocean floor leading to land residue to be brought over and filling the void.”

Hence, the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) will be conducting research on the new island to solve the mystery of its birth.

What do you guys think of this phenomenon? What do you reckon caused the creation of this new small island? Share your thoughts with us in the comments!

(AP Photo)

SEOUL--A South Korean steelmaker on Friday said it plans to end a joint venture with a military-controlled firm in Myanmar following criticism that its business has benefited military leaders who have violently suppressed pro-democracy protests there.

POSCO Coated & Color Steel said it has decided to discontinue its partnership with Myanmar Economic Holdings Public Co. Ltd, which is about 40 percent owned by Myanmar’s Defense Ministry. However, the South Korean company said it would not pull out of Myanmar.

POSCO C&C owns 70 percent of its joint venture with MEHL, Myanmar POSCO C&C. Min Ji-hyun, an official from POSCO C&C, said the company has informed MEHL it wants to buy the Myanmar firm’s 30 percent stake so that it can continue operating the venture with full ownership. MEHL has yet to respond to POSCO C&C’s offer, Min said.

Min said he couldn’t provide detailed estimates on how much the deal would cost POSCO C&C, saying that would depend on when it goes through. He said the company will look for “other ways” to continue doing business in Myanmar if MEHL refuses to sell its stake but did not elaborate on what those might be.

Human rights activists have been pressuring many companies around the globe to end any financial support for the military. The U.S. government has imposed sanctions on MEHL and a similar military-controlled conglomerate, Myanmar Economic Corp.

POSCO C&C is an affiliate of South Korean steel giant POSCO that manufactures steel sheets. The company issued a statement saying it hopes its steel business will “continue to contribute in improving living environments in Myanmar and facilitate the country’s economy.”

A military junta took over Myanmar from an elected civilian government in a Feb. 1 coup. Security forces have killed at least 700 civilian protesters and bystanders, have detained the former government’s leaders, and have charged doctors, entertainers and others with crimes over their opposition to the coup.

In a statement, the rights group Justice for Myanmar said it cautiously welcomed Posco C&C’s decision but urged it to “immediately end all other business ties with the Myanmar military junta and its conglomerates.""

That includes rent on land leased by entities associated with the military, it said.

The statement was jointly issued with the Korean Civil Society in Support of Democracy in Myanmar, a network of more than 100 rights groups. That group said that it had joined with other advocacy organizations to file a complaint with South Korea’s National Human Rights Commission and other agencies to protest business ties between Korean companies and the military. That complaint was filed in November, long before the coup.",459,2856,45,293
0,"‘Complete turnaround’: Philippines’ Duterte lifts ban on new mining permits: Duterte’s pivot in favor of mining goes back to 2019, when the government allowed the operation of suspended mining firms, particularly nickel mines, to cater to Chinese demand for nickel.",https://news.mongabay.com/2021/04/complete-turnaround-philippines-duterte-lifts-ban-on-new-mining-permits/,"President Rodrigo Duterte has lifted a ban on issuing licenses for new mining operations in the Philippines, marking an about-face from a previous anti-mining stance that saw him ban open-pit mining in 2017 and close or suspend 26 mining operations for environmental violations.

The government says the industry, which contributed 0.76% to the country’s GDP in 2020, is important in resuscitating an economy bogged down by the COVID-19 pandemic, by generating revenue and jobs and contributing to Duterte’s flagship infrastructure program.

Duterte’s pivot in favor of mining goes back to 2019, when the government allowed the operation of suspended mining firms and pushed for the rehabilitation of government-owned mines, particularly nickel mines, to cater to Chinese demand for nickel.

The mining sector was the deadliest in the world for environmental and land defenders in 2019, according to Global Witness; the Philippines has the most mining-related killings that year, and activists warn the new order could further endanger defenders as well as open key biodiversity areas to mining.

MANILA — President Rodrigo Duterte has issued an order to lift a nine-year moratorium on granting new mining permits in the Philippines. The order is expected to ease the entry of at least 291 existing mining applications, escalating threats to the environment and its defenders, anti-mining and environmental groups say.

Signed April 14 and made public April 15, Executive Order 130 highlights the contribution of the extractives sector in reviving the country’s economy amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

The sector is expected to support important projects like Duterte’s flagship “Build, Build, Build” infrastructure program, which the government says is pivotal to economic recovery. More mining would also create more jobs, the government says, in the country with one of the highest unemployment rates in Southeast Asia. Some 190,000 people were employed in mining in the Philippines before the pandemic, according to data from the Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB).

While other sectors in the country have declined due to the pandemic and the lockdowns imposed in response to it, mining actually grew by 1.13%, driven mainly by nickel demand from China and a high gold price. The precious metal peaked at $2,000 per ounce last August and is expected to average at $1,700 this year as investors seek out a safe-haven asset.

While mining industry revenue contributed just 0.76% of the Philippines’ GDP in 2020, according to the Philippine Statistics Office, the government expects an increase in earnings from excise tax collections. It attributes this to the Tax Reform for Acceleration of Inclusion (TRAIN) Act passed in 2017, which “doubled the rate of excise tax on minerals, mineral products and quarry resources from 2% to 4%.”

The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and the Department of Finance are expected to “formulate the terms and conditions in the new mineral agreements that will maximize government revenues and share from production, including the possibility of declaring these areas as mineral reservations to obtain appropriate royalties, in accordance to existing laws, rules, and regulations,” the executive order stated.

As the government anticipates a boon, anti-mining and human rights groups say lifting the moratorium on new mines will be anything but. They expressed dismay at Duterte’s executive order, which they say marks a complete pivot to a sector he condemned extensively in the early years of his presidency.

“President Duterte has completed his turnaround, from claiming to protect and stop the destruction of forests by destructive mining, to a pro-mining president,” Alyansa Tigil Mina (ATM), a coalition of anti-mining groups, said in a message to Mongabay. “Lifting the moratorium exposes this administration’s support for mining projects that will impact our water, food supply, forest, biodiversity, Indigenous communities and fragile island ecosystems.”

Rallying industry

When he assumed office in 2016, Duterte was outspoken in his opposition to mining, which he blamed for degrading the environment. He imposed a ban on open-pit mining in 2017 and appointed Gina Lopez, a staunch anti-mining advocate, as secretary of the DENR. In her one year in office, Lopez oversaw the closure and/or suspension of permits for 26 mining operations found in violation of environmental regulations.

By 2019, anti-mining groups noted that Duterte had gone quiet over mining, making no mention of the sector in his public speeches. That same year, the DENR’s MGB recommended the reopening of mines shuttered under Lopez’s watch, including the operation of the OceanaGold-operated Didipio gold mines in Nueva Vizcaya province whose permit lapsed that same year.

While Duterte’s policies on mining have caused instability in the sector, experts anticipated the domestic industry would rebound after neighboring Indonesia, the world’s biggest nickel producer, imposed an export ban on the metal in January 2020. The Philippines, the No. 2 producer, stepped in to fill nickel demand from China, exporting 333,962 tonnes last year.

Even amid strict government-imposed lockdowns that banned travel by land, air or sea, the mining industry was allowed to continue operating in the Philippines. This raised tensions with local governments, which wanted mining operations halted to curb the spread of COVID-19.

Last October, Secretary of Finance Carlos Dominguez III announced the government’s plan to revive the mining industryby privatizing government-owned mines, including two abandoned nickel mines in Surigao del Norte province and Marinduque province. That same month, Duterte lifted an oil exploration moratorium in what the Philippine government calls the West Philippine Sea, an area it claims in the South China Sea.

These government decisions boosted mining and oil stocks on the Philippine bourse. The sector closed 17.5% higher by the end of 2020, making it one of the biggest gainers amid the pandemic.

Duterte’s new order has had an immediate impact: Hours after he lifted the mining moratorium, the mining and oil index rose 5.38% by the close of trade on April 15.

Risk to environment, defenders

On the ground, various groups have warned that the executive order is poised to escalate threats to the environment and its defenders.

Mining was the deadliest sector for environmental and land defenders in the world in 2019, according to the watchdog Global Witness. That year, the Philippines topped the list of countries with the highest number of mining-linked deaths of environmental defenders.

Among the 16 fatalities that year was Datu Kaylo Bontolan, an Indigenous Manobo leader on the southern island of Mindanao, who was murdered after opposing illegal mining in his community in the Pantaron mountain range.

Displaced Indigenous groups in Mindanao have linked an ongoing government crackdown against them as cover to clear ancestral domain lands for mining companies, particularly small-scale Chinese firms with pending mining applications. Since 2000, Chinese investments in the Philippine mining sector have been channeled through “local elites in the artisanal small-scale mining (ASM) firms,” a study notes.

“This support to more mining projects will encourage more Chinese investments to extract nickel, black sand and copper minerals here in the Philippines,” anti-mining coalition Alyansa Tigil Mina said. “All these will only benefit Chinese demands and not Philippine industrialization.”

In Palawan province, one of the most biodiverse areas in the country, the order could potentially greenlight the operations of at least five mining applications, according to the Environmental Legal Assistance Center (ELAC). While the province is governed by a strategic environmental plan that bans mining, there has been an increase in mining applications, said ELAC executive director Grizelda Mayo-Anda.

“Existing mining companies which have been suspended … plan to expand their mining operations in Palawan,” she told Mongabay.

She added it’s especially alarming that these mining permits target areas of natural forest in the province, some of them within key biodiversity areas and protected areas.

“The DENR and the PCSD [Palawan Council for Sustainable Development] must be reminded that under the Strategic Environmental Plan for Palawan law (Republic Act 7611), all natural forests are areas of maximum protection or core zones,” Mayo-Anda said.

Leon Dulce, an activist with the Kalikasan People’s Network for the Environment (Kalikasan), said he was unconvinced the new order will uphold environmental protection, given that the country’s mining law gives permit holders complete access to natural resources within their concessions.

“The Mining Act provides auxiliary rights to mines that allow them to cut timber, deplete water, and ‘ease out’ communities away from their lands,” Dulce said in a message to Mongabay. “As part of its investment guarantees, the Mining Act commits government to ensuring the removal of obstacles to mining, and that includes conflicting land uses such as agricultural lands and communities.”

Dulce also noted provisions in the act that limit rehabilitation, such as token fines of just $1 per ton for companies disposing of waste in unauthorized areas, and similarly low compensation obligations for damage caused by mine waste and tailings. “That leaves all mines prone to ‘externalizing’ environmental costs,” Dulce said. “In other words, polluters will not pay.”

NEW YORK—Real estate mogul and television personality Donald Trump reportedly stood before his bedroom's full-length mirror Wednesday morning and stared forlornly at his aged, shriveled penis before getting dressed and leaving his residence in Manhattan's Trump Tower to start the day.

According to reports, the 66-year-old had laid his suit out on his bed and was preparing to step into a pair of silk boxer shorts when he glimpsed his deteriorating body in the mirror. Trump then spent approximately 15 to 20 minutes morosely reflecting on his appearance, dedicating most of that time to gazing at his desiccated sexual anatomy and contemplating its all-but-total lack of function.

""God, look at this thing,"" said a dejected Trump, hoisting up a large quantity of belly flab with his forearm to make his stunted organ visible. ""Pitiful.""

Trump, who in just over an hour would be appearing on the morning show Fox And Friends to assert that the president of the United States was not an American citizen, is said to have grasped the bulb of his penis with his thumb and forefinger and stretched the organ to its full 3-inch length before letting it go and leaving it to loll on an unruly tangle of mostly gray pubic hair. Noticing the pronounced droop of his scrotum, Trump glumly cupped his testicles in his hand and lifted them several inches until they reached the approximate height at which they had hung in his youth and even into early middle age.

Sources say Trump sat on his bed and lightly shook his head for a full five minutes.

At this point, Trump is purported to have released the heavily crinkled pouch and sighed deeply.

""What the hell happened?"" said Trump, who appeared to receive no reassurance by swiveling and viewing his shrunken penis in profile. ""It's just…dead.""

Sources confirmed Trump then received a phone call from an Associated Press reporter asking him to respond to charges that he was a ""blowhard"" and a ""bully,"" allegations Trump managed to address despite his preoccupation with the condition of his sexual organ.

""I'm rich and famous, and everyone wants to be me,"" Trump told the caller, all the while struggling to recall the last time he was able to achieve even a partial erection. ""That doesn't make me a bully. That just makes me better than most people.""

""There's never been a success story like mine in the history of America,"" continued Trump, who briefly tipped the phone away from his mouth as he licked his palm and began tugging on his penis with a loose fist. ""I'm a phenomenon, and I don't care who knows it—of course, everyone already does.""

Upon disconnecting, Trump continued to stroke vigorously for three full minutes before giving up in exhaustion.

Shortly thereafter, Trump reportedly turned his attention to the remainder of his body, miserably noting in his reflection the complete absence of muscle tone in his arms, the vast network of wrinkles on his face that showed through despite a freshly applied layer of bronzer, and the loose flesh on his neck, which he pulled taut several times with his thumbs. According to sources, Trump then attempted to shake free of his melancholy by rising to his toes in a boxing stance and pantomiming a series of punch combinations, an effort that quickly embarrassed him and intensified his gloom.

""Sixty-six years old,"" said Trump, who has an estimated fortune of $2.9 billion. ""What's 70 going to look like? And 75? What the hell am I gonna do then?""

An aide to the former Archbishop of Canterbury faces questions from the charity watchdog over allegations that proceeds from the sale of a £300,000 church property “disappeared”. The Charity Commission is assessing allegations that two leading bishops “beguiled” elderly congregants to sign over their status as trustees of church properties for “precisely nothing”. It is claimed that proceeds from the sale of property meant for the benefit of local congregations have allegedly “disappeared without an audit trail”. The commission is examining complaints from trustees over possible irregularities in charity accounts overseen by the Bishop Primus and Bishop of the Northern Diocese, the Rt Rev Dr John Fenwick – a former adviser to Lord Carey, the previous Archbishop of Canterbury – and the Bishop of the Southern Diocese, the Rt Rev Paul Hunt. West Midlands Police said it was reviewing an allegation of fraud to establish if any offences may have been committed. Bishop Fenwick leads the Free Church of England, a splinter group from the Church of England that was forged in the mid 19th century. He is supported in his role by Bishop Hunt. It is alleged that Bishop Fenwick assured congregants that £300,000 from the sale of St Stephen’s Church in Middlesbrough was being held in the FCE Central Trust. However, the complainants say the company’s records do not show any record of the money being deposited. The commission has received allegations that the transfer of property from congregants to the trust has happened because “frail, elderly” trustees are “being persuaded that it will relieve them of the stresses of trusteeship and safeguard the future of the property”. The watchdog is also assessing claims that the trust was registering local churches’ land and buildings in its name without ever paying for them, nor reflecting their value in the accounts. “Perhaps [this is] because Bishop Fenwick has been persuading befuddled, elderly and weary local church trustees to sign over their properties to Central Trust for precisely nothing,” one complainant alleged. The commission is also assessing an allegation that around £30,000 “disappeared without an audit trail” from the bank account of Emmanuel Free Church of England, Morecambe, in 2017. The FCE Central Trust responded on behalf of both bishops, saying it “vigorously refutes the allegations”. “If they are indeed the subject of Charity Commission and police investigations (though the Trust has been contacted by neither) then it would be inappropriate to comment further,” it said. Bishop Fenwick said St Stephen’s Church was sold after consultation with the congregation because it was “found to be in a dangerous state of repair”. He said a portion of the proceeds of the sale were used to hire a minister – for £24,000 per year, plus accommodation costs and expenses – in the hope of “reviving the congregation” in April 2018. After two years, “there had been no significant growth in the size of the congregation”, and the minister was made redundant in February 2021.",493,3067,10,74

What better way to bid farewell to your loved one than allowing this stately oligarch to indulge in his unique gastronomic preferences?” At press time, the service had shut down after Dieter died of kuru.

0,Chinese Militia Vessels Depart South China Sea,https://thediplomat.com/2021/04/chinese-militia-vessels-departing-contested-south-china-sea-reef/,"Advertisement

In mid-March, the Philippines discovered that a reef in its exclusive economic zone was being occupied by scores of nearly identical Chinese fishing vessels, later determined to be part of China’s shadowy, para-military maritime militia. Their presence sparked fears that China could be making a move to seize effective control over a new feature in the hotly disputed South China Sea.

According to the Philippines’ secretary of foreign affairs, only a handful of Chinese militia vessels remained at Whitsun Reef as of April 13.

Called the Julian Felipe Reef by the Philippines and Niu’e Jiao by China, Whitsun Reef is 170 nautical miles west of Palawan in the northern part of the Spratly Islands, where China has built up several large artificial islands on formerly submerged reefs and constructed major military installations.

At one point, the Philippines defense department counted 220 Chinese vessels at the reef. Many or most are believed to have been part of China’s maritime militia, lightly armed paramilitary vessels that China uses to harass and coerce other Southeast Asian countries’ fishermen in waters China claims as its own. Maritime militia vessels were also responsible for the infamous harassment of a U.S. Navy surveillance ship in 2009.

Asked whether China intended to keep a permanent presence at Whitsun Reef, a spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry said that “China has no such plan.” But he also reiterated China’s position that the reef was Chinese territory, and that a 2016 United Nations tribunal ruling in the Philippines’ favor over contested South China Sea features was “illegal, null and void.” The Philippines should “immediately stop wanton hype-up,” the spokesman added.

He also insisted that the vessels were fishing boats sheltering from a storm – “It is a customary practice running over a thousand years for Chinese fishing boats to work and shelter in relevant waters” – and that they were not part of China’s maritime militia.

Photographs of the flotilla showed little or no evidence of fishing equipment on the vessels, however. Analysts from the U.S. Naval War College were able to prove that several of the vessels were known to be part of the maritime militia, and most others matched a type that was purpose-built for the militia units for Sansha City, which China uses to administer its claimed territory and waters in the South China Sea.

The Philippines’ defense secretary demanded that China recall the vessels and the secretary of state filed a diplomatic protest to Beijing. The Philippines sent a naval task force to patrol the area and U.S. warships have been concentrating in the region over the past week, including a carrier strike group and an amphibious group.

The insistence by China’s Foreign Ministry that the vessels were taking refuge from “rough sea conditions” in the reef was belied by the succession of photographs taken over the past few weeks showing the boats floating in calm waters.

The Philippines is haunted by the effective loss of its control over the Scarborough Shoal in 2012 when China reneged on a U.S.-brokered deal for both countries to pull back their vessels from a mounting standoff. China continues to fish there and patrol the shoal with both maritime militia and coast guard vessels, denying its use to Filipino fishermen who have trawled its waters for generations. When it appeared that China was preparing to reclaim and build on Scarborough Shoal in the same way it had in the Spratly Islands, the United States reportedly intervened behind the scenes to deter Beijing. China’s long-term aims at Whitsun Reef are unclear and may still be undecided by Chinese leadership.

It is not clear why China’s militia vessels are vacating the reef now, and whether, or when, they may return. In the worst case, they could return with back up from China’s coast guard or the navy. If China moved that aggressively, it could spark a significant crisis. China’s island construction to date all occurred on features that China had previously occupied. Seizing control of a new reef and building military facilities on it would be a significant escalation of its efforts to expand control over the South China Sea.",728,4469,7,46

0,Beijing Revises 'Correct' Version of Party History Ahead of Centenary,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/history-04152021091451.html/,"People visit an exhibition to mark the 100th founding anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party at a museum in Beijing, March 12, 2021.

The ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has set up a hotline for people to report each other to the authorities for failing to toe the party's freshly revised line on matters of history.

The Cyberspace Administration said in a post to its official Weibo account on April 9 that people should use the number ""to report erroneous online remarks relating to historical nihilism.""

The move is to ""create a good public opinion environment"" regarding China's history since the CCP took power in 1949, the post said.

To help those who may be unsure of which opinions are the ""correct"" ones, the CCP has also published a handy guide in the form of a book titled A Brief History of the Communist Party of China.

Published to mark the party's centenary this year, the revised history plays down the cautious diplomatic approach of late supreme leader Deng Xiaoping in the wake of international sanctions following the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, instead highlighting his comments to former U.S. president Richard Nixon in November 2019.

Deng told Nixon that China would never ""beg"" for sanctions to be lifted, the book says.

The U.S. and Europe imposed an arms embargo on China after the People's Liberation Army (PLA) attached unarmed civilians with machine guns and tanks in an operation that ended weeks of pro-democracy protests on Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989.

The new edition deletes an 11,000-word chapter dedicated to the political turmoil of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) relegating the 10 years of mayhem to a single page in a chapter titled ""Twists and Turns on the Road to Socialist Reconstruction.""

The older edition, published under former president Hu Jintao in 2010, said late supreme leader Mao Zedong should bear responsibility for starting the Cultural Revolution, which turned out to be a ""serious disaster"" for the Chinese people.

The latest edition makes no such criticism of Mao, saying instead that the late Chairman had waged ""an incessant war on corruption, special privileges and bureaucratic mentality within party ranks.""

""Many of his correct ideas about how to build a socialist society weren't fully implemented, which led to internal turmoil,"" the new version says.

Chapters on the Great Famine during the Great Leap Forward of 1959-1961, the collectivization of farming under the People's Communes in the 1950s and on the often brutal ""anti-rightist"" political campaigns targeting intellectuals have also been deleted.

Forgetting the mistakes

CCP history expert Gao Wenqian said CCP general secretary Xi Jinping is revising the country's history under CCP rule in a bid to focus minds away from the party's mistakes, and to emphasize the positive roles played by leaders who ruled alone, wielding huge personal power.

""The 'History of the Communist Party of China' has always been an exercise in realpolitik,"" Gao said. ""Back when Mao Zedong launched the rectification campaign in the Yan’an period ... the CCP passed its first historical resolution, which was aimed at cementing Mao's status.""

""Deng Xiaoping also passed a historical resolution in 1981 that made a huge deal of Mao's mistakes in the wake of the Cultural Revolution, while letting Lin Biao and the Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary clique off the hook.""

""The aim was to win firm support for economic reform and opening up, and to ensure continued party rule,"" Gao said.

The book portrays Mao as a conscientious leader constantly aware of the danger of ""capitalist restoration,"" which echoes Xi's current campaign against ""imported"" notions of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.

It blames the ""civil unrest"" of the Cultural Revolution on the failure to implement Mao's ""correct"" ideas, while erasing pages of description of the campaigns against the ""four olds,"" mob justice and door-to-door raids, as well as armed clashes between rebel factions in the streets.

Gao said the claim that Mao's ""anti-corruption"" campaign was at the heart of the Cultural Revolution is a ridiculous one.

""Mao Zedong had more power and privilege than anyone else in the CCP, and similarly, Xi Jinping is one of the biggest shields for corrupt officials today,"" Gao said. ""One-party dictatorship is the most corrupt thing of all.""

""Xi Jinping is falling into the same trap that Mao did in his later years, holding a huge amount of power but still unable to sleep at night,"" Gao said. ""Xi Jinping has been in power for 10 years now, so this isn't about establishing or consolidating his power.""

""It looks a lot like the same tricks Mao used to engage in, to protect his personal power and authority,"" he said.

Keeping up the pressure

The final chapter of the new edition takes up around a quarter of the book, and is dedicated to Xi's personal brand of ideology, ""socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.""

""This new edition ... is to further keep up the ideological pressure on the Chinese people,"" Gao said. ""Back in 1967-1969 we had slogans on the walls ... Today, in Cultural Revolution 2.0, we have quotations from Xi Jinping in the People's Daily every day, and in the streets and alleyways.""

""Everyone in China has to study [this version of] party history now,"" Gao said. ""I feel sorry for the kids.""

The renewed emphasis on history comes after Xi told a Feb. 20 meeting that the history of the Chinese revolution was ""the best nourishment"" for its people.

""Our faith and beliefs are of the utmost importance at all times,"" Xi said. ""Our belief in communism and in socialism with Chinese characteristics are our political soul, and our spiritual rock that will enable us as communists to withstand any challenge.""

""The party's century of struggle and great achievements are the best foundation for us to build [self-confidence] as a nation,"" he said.

U.S.-based historian Liu Zhongjing said Xi wants Marxism-Leninism to become an inseparable part of Chinese tradition and Chinese culture, much as Buddhism was used to establish the Tang (618-907) and Song (960-1127) dynasties.

""In this way, the new China led by the descendants of Kubla Khan was able to inherit the Tang and Song dynasties, which became the newly anointed dynasties,"" Liu said.

According to Liu, Xi spoke of ""faith and beliefs"" because he is deliberately using political ideology as a new theology to underpin the CCP in a manner similar to an imperial dynasty.

U.S.-based commentator Hu Ping, honorary editor-in-chief of the online magazine ""Beijing Spring"", said Xi's revised version of party history, in trying to draw on Mao-era revolutionary tropes while at the same time still allowing capitalist-style economic activity, is trying to have its cake and eat it.

""These two periods of history [presided over by Mao and Deng] are mutually exclusive,"" Hu said. ""If the revolution had it right and the reform era had it wrong, then he should step down.""

""If the reform era had it right and the revolution was wrong, then he should change course.""

Hu said allowing private ownership of assets is at odds with the communist beliefs Xi draws on for his political ""faith.""

""The original intention of the CCP was to eliminate the private ownership of property,"" Hu said. ""After taking on the capitalists and winning, it has itself become a hugely capitalist enterprise.""

Israel will lift the requirement to wear masks outdoors starting on Sunday, Health Minister Yuli Edelstein announced on Thursday. The requirement will remain for indoor spaces.“The masks are intended to protect us from the coronavirus,” said Edelstein. “After our health professionals came to the conclusion that they are no longer needed outdoors, I decided to allow it according to their recommendation. The level of morbidity in Israel is very low thanks to our successful vaccination campaign, and thus we can ease up further restrictions for you, citizens of Israel. I ask you to still carry a mask in order to enter closed buildings. Together we will keep the morbidity low .”The move had been under discussion for several weeks, but authorities decided to wait until the end of Remembrance Day and Independence Day, fearing that mask-less celebrations might lead to a spike in cases.The majority of experts agree that the risk of contracting the coronavirus outdoors is very limited.“We know that wearing masks outdoors is not as effective as doing it indoors,” Dr. Eyal Leshem, the director of the Center for Travel Medicine and Tropical Diseases at Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, said last week. “Moreover, we see that many people don’t actually wear masks anymore anyway.

1,We’ve Seen Enough: OGN Is Officially Calling The State Of New Hampshire For Gamers,https://ogn.theonion.com/we-ve-seen-enough-ogn-is-officially-calling-the-state-1846280266,"All right, that’s it, folks! After extensive conversation among the experts at the Onion Gamer’s Network Decision Desk, we are officially calling New Hampshire for gamers.

We’ve seen enough: The Granite State is for gamers, by gamers, and all about gamers.



Although we only have reports from 60% of polling stations at this point, our analysts can tell us with a high degree of certainty that New Hampshire is a statistical certainty to go for gamers tonight. This is particularly clear if you look at the makeup of the remaining uncounted districts, which are all from video game–friendly areas. Most of these communities have at least one Secretlab Omega gaming chair per household and rank traditional gamer values like support for LAN Parties and subsidies for guarana-based beverages as the most important issues to them and their loved ones.

Needless to say, this is a sea change of the nationwide landscape for gamers. Yes, we saw some seeds of this in 2012 when areas around Baltimore saw higher Xbox enthusiasts in the so-called Green Tsunami, but it seemed that the promise of a fully gaming-forward New Hampshire was always going to be a pipe dream for video game fans.

Gamers, that dream has now become a reality.

Now, is this a surprise? Not necessarily. Sure, there was worry that infighting among PlayStation and Switch gamers would split the vote and serve as a spoiler for tonight’s results. But these console fanboys and fangirls were able to come together to form a multi-coalition gaming bloc, stringing together a big tent along with mobile gamers and casuals that’s allowed video gaming to take New Hampshire by storm.

Frankly, it’s a relief for us at OGN to end the long nights of pounding MTN Dew Major Melon to stay up late for result-tallying and finally say, definitively, that New Hampshire has gone for gamers. And, of course, as much as we strive to keep our process objective, it’s important to admit that many of us were actually pulling for gamers to emerge triumphant today. Certainly, this paves the way for a bold gaming agenda over the next few years.

We’ll get back to you in three weeks when these results are certified by the gaming judges. But it’s worthwhile to take a moment to truly appreciate the magnitude of what’s happened tonight. Because it’s big, gamers. Really big.

“Due to the serious threats to French interests in Pakistan, French nationals and French companies are recommended to temporarily leave the country,” read the letter from the French embassy to its citizens in Pakistan on Thursday.

The move comes after a week of intense protests against French interests in the country, with radical Islamist party Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan paralyzing the country's two largest cities, Lahore and Karachi, as well as the capital Islamabad, demanding the expulsion of the ambassador of France.

The group, which was banned on Wednesday under the Anti-Terrorism Act, has made the issue of “blasphemy” its rallying cry. Since November, it has called for the expulsion of the French ambassador and a ban on all French goods following President Emmanuel Macron’s vocal support for freedom of expression and his refusal to condemn the showing of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed.

In November, the group blocked highways and called on the government to consider its demands. The organization threatened to restart protests on April 20 if the government had not met its demands, but the arrest of its leader on Monday by Pakistani authorities triggered a new wave of demonstrations.

On Wednesday, Interior Minister Sheikh Rasheed confirmed that two police officers were killed and 340 wounded by demonstrators in the past 48 hours as mass protests hit the country, led by Tehreek-e-Labbaik.

0,Ukraine’s national airline plans a ‘joy flight’ over Chernobyl 35 years after the nuclear accident,https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/chernobyl-nuclear-disaster-ukraine-airline-b1830470.html,"In perhaps the weirdest “flight to nowhere” since the coronavirus pandemic began, the Ukrainian national airline plans an overflight of the location for the worst nuclear accident in history.

On 25 April 1986, reactor number 4 at the Chernobyl nuclear power planet exploded – killing some people instantly and many more over the following years. Radioactive material covered the surrounding area, laying waste to territory both in Ukraine and across the border in Belarus.

While desperate efforts took place to limit the destruction, the wind carried nuclear debris across Europe, reaching as far as Sweden in just 24 hours.

The site of the blast is still contaminated and cleaning up the area is expected to take decades.

Yet on the eve of the 35th anniversary, Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) will operate what it calls a “Flight over Kyiv and Chernobyl”.

The company says: “On the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, Ukraine International Airlines invites you to take the opportunity and visit the unique flight ‘Flight over Kyiv and Chernobyl’, which will take place on the eve of the anniversary – April 25!

“Passengers of the flight will be able not only to see Kyiv and Chernobyl from the most unusual angles and the minimum allowable height - 900 metres [3,000 feet] – but also to deepen their knowledge about the causes and consequences of the Chernobyl accident.”

Participants are offered the chance to “take a photo in the cockpit and take a selfie with the pilot”, presumably while the plane is on the ground rather than in the air.

One of the tour companies that normally runs terrestrial trips to the exclusion zone will be onboard.

The airline says the flight will be accompanied by “aviation stories from UIA pilots who will fly with passengers in the cabin”.

There will also be a raffle for “souvenirs and gifts from UIA” with a top prize of a day trip to the Chernobyl zone, “one of the most popular tourist locations in the world”.

The cost is 2,970 Ukrainian hryvnia (£77), much less than most “flights to nowhere”.

British tourists will be unable to take part because the UK government bans non-essential travel overseas.

Before the flight, UIA recommends: “You can plunge into the whirlpool of emotions of the flight and watch a video from UIA co-pilot Ivan Iliuchenko.”

Dr Claire Corkhill, reader in Nuclear Material Corrosion at the University of Sheffield, said the experience should not be dangerous for participants.

“Now that the new safe confinement – the large arch covering the reactor – is in place, the radioactive particles in the reactor are completely sealed in, so there should be no issues with flying over the top,” she told The Independent.

“And 35 years after the disaster is roughly the equivalent of one half life of the most radioactive elements in the reactor. So the gamma rays that are emitted from the hole in the top of the reactor building are not only shielded by the new safe confinement, but they are half as intense as they were at the time of accident.”

Dr Corkhill added: “I often watch airplane maps on long-haul flights to spot when we’re flying over nuclear reactors, but this is really something.”

Several other airlines have offered “joy flights” during the coronavirus pandemic, as international air travel remains in a deep slump.

The latest was an Emirates flight from its hub in Dubai, notable because everyone on board had been vaccinated.

0,Valencia University: Europe's Most Wanted,https://valencian.es/valencia-university/,"Spain is the number one country for Erasmus exchange students, and Valencia University is Europe’s most desired university…

Valencia has become a favourite among European students participating in the Erasmus exchange programme, according to European Commission data. The University hosted 2,401 foreign students in the 2019-2020 academic year, ranking first in Europe. Not only that, but the Polytechnic of Valencia, Valencia’s second university, was the fourth most visited university in the whole of Europe.

Valencia has clearly become a popular destination for international students.

So why do students choose Valencia?

Clearly, it is not just to learn. Valencia University does not even rank among the top 400 universities in the world, and the Polytechnic of Valencia barely ranks among the top 300. It is safe to say that the majority of European students come to our city for the unique way of life. The weather is pleasant all year, and the nightlife – outside of restrictions – is also appealing. When you factor in the low prices for not only the courses, but also for accommodation, transportation, and food, it’s easy to see why Valencia is so popular.

Since its inception in 1987, the Erasmus Exchange programme has become something of a miracle, moving around five million students each year across 4,000 universities and 31 countries.

The programme was designed to foster cultural, social, and academic exchanges among European students, as well as to serve as a unifying force in the old continent. And this concept was a complete success. The program’s total budget has grown from modest beginnings to €26bn in 2021, which is more than the total educational budget of many of its members.

Spain has become one of the most active countries in the programme, with the most students from all over Europe. Erasmus enabled 58,830 foreign students to spend a full semester in Spain in 2019. However, it is not a one-way street; Spaniards enjoy studying abroad as well, with 44,000 Spanish students travelling abroad in the same year.

A Spanish court has provoked outrage by acquitting a man of sexually abusing his 14-year-old stepdaughter despite the fact she gave birth to his child.

The Pamplona court accepted the defendant’s claim that the teenager had sat astride him while he was asleep on the sofa and engaged in penetrative sex. The man said he had no recollection of the supposed encounter as he had been very drunk that night.

Close to nine months later, in December 2018, the girl was admitted to hospital and gave birth to a child, something the accused claimed had been a complete surprise to him and the girl’s mother. Social services ordered a paternity test, which confirmed that the stepfather was the father of the baby.

The girl’s mother reported the father for alleged sexual abuse of her daughter, who initially said she had been raped in the street before changing her story to corroborate her stepfather’s claim that he had not been conscious when they had sex.

The judges, sitting in the same Pamplona court that in 2018 sparked massive feminist protests when acquitting the “wolf pack” gang rapists who were later found guilty on appeal, said that there was insufficient evidence to convict the stepfather.

However, the sentence also noted that the girl had “kept her head and eyes facing down” during the trial, “answering questions very briefly in a barely audible voice”.

Altamira Gonzalo, vice-president of the Themis women jurists’ association, said the verdict “takes us back to the kind of sentences we used to see in Spain in the 1950s or 60s, when there was complete impunity for men in the family environment”.

“The sentence beggars belief. The only thing the court valued is the accused’s right to the presumption of innocence. It has ignored its duty to protect a minor and the fact that the age of consent in Spain is 16,” Ms Gonzalo told The Telegraph.

Spain’s parliament this week passed a new child protection law backed by NGOs such as Save the Children, which estimates that only 15 per cent of family abuse cases in Spain are reported.

Cira García, a judge from one of Spain’s gender violence courts, said the sentence does not even consider the possibility that the girl may have changed her version of events in order to protect her stepfather.

“We are sick of criticising that children’s testimony is often not given credibility and they are accused of lying in court, but here the girl’s word is accepted without question to absolve the accused, even though her account of events is absolutely implausible,” Ms García told the online newspaper Público.",478,2824,14,90

The modelling also shows up to 1,800 patients in intensive care by the end of May, according to the sources.

Projections released by the province two weeks ago had forecast up to 12,000 new cases per day with around 800-1,000 people in ICU by the end of April.

Restricting curbside pick-up (only permit non-essential retail to deliver).

Shutting down non-essential construction, warehouses and manufacturing not related to health, food or automotive.

Prohibiting all outdoor gatherings for non-family members in the same household.

Tightening capacity of indoor events like places of worship, weddings and funerals.

Increasing fines, increase policing powers.

Sources say Premier Doug Ford asked Alberta Premier Jason Kenney to send health-care workers to Ontario to help. Alberta has not yet made any commitments, the sources say.

Sources with knowledge of the request tell CBC News that Ford also made a similar request to Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe.

CBC News has also learned Ontario will make a formal request to the federal government for more than 600 critical care staff to support the province's hospitals with ICU occupancy. The formal request has not happened yet.

""We have received Ontario's draft letter,"" said Mary-Liz Power, spokesperson for federal Public Safety Minister Bill Blair.

""We are currently in discussions with the province to determine how best we can support them with more resources,"" she said, adding that the federal government is working closely with all provinces and territories to help support them amid the pandemic.

According to sources, the Ministry of Health has requested access to additional provincial money to tackle the third wave of the pandemic.

In a request that has not yet been formally approved, sources say the ministry is asking for up to $346 million for more health workers to support the creation of 1,000 incremental critical care beds in Ontario hospitals with high COVID-19 in-patient and ICU numbers.

The ministry is also looking at redeploying 1,000 staff from hospitals with lower COVID-19 patients and ICU occupancy to those with the highest ICU and in-patients.

This proposal has also not yet been formally approved.

""Premier Ford has said from the very beginning of this pandemic, that all options are on the table,"" Solicitor General Sylvia Jones said Thursday. ""And that continues to be our philosophy as a cabinet and a caucus.""

Jones, however, acknowledged the challenges a curfew would present in Ontario, pointing to the anti-curfew protests in Quebec.

""I think the Montreal riots speak to the challenge of both enforcing, and people's willingness to do a curfew,"" she said.

The Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA) said a curfew would not help the public health crisis, and urged the government not to go down that road.

""Imposing a curfew is an admission that the government has run out of ideas,"" said Cara Zwibel, director of fundamental freedoms at the CCLA. ""It is an unnecessary and disproportionate measure that is likely to do more harm than good.""

On Thursday night, sources with knowledge of the discussions told CBC News the cabinet has decided against imposing a curfew.

The cabinet is expected to resume meeting Friday to discuss imposing further measures.

All-time high

Ford's cabinet met Thursday as the province reported a record 4,736 new cases of COVID-19 and 29 more related deaths.

Meanwhile, the coronavirus has sent 1,932 people to the province's hospitals despite a stay-at-home order. There are 659 patients in intensive care and 419 on ventilators.

Hospitals have been ramping down non-essential and non-urgent medical procedures this week to ensure they have the capacity to care for COVID-19 patients.

The government said a COVID-19 field hospital could be opened in Toronto later this month.

The Ministry of Health said a mobile health unit at Sunnybrook Hospital, set up in the facility's parking lot, is expected to take patients in the coming weeks.

It is one of two field hospitals in the province designed to help address growing capacity challenges.

The province said the temporary beds will provide increased capacity to the health system as a whole by freeing up acute and critical care capacity within hospitals.

Variants surge in Grey-Bruce

The government said it will also help expand capacity by allowing the hospitals to transfer non-critical care patients to these general medicine beds.

Meanwhile, the Grey Bruce Health Unit told residents to stay home for the next two days as COVID-19 variants of concern surge in the region.

Public health authorities said all residents should consider themselves a COVID-19 carrier for the next 48 hours.

Authorities said the steps are necessary after 70 new cases were confirmed in the region in the past 36 hours.

The public health unit said it needs to slow the spread of the virus in order to do contact tracing.

It is also shutting down the Grey Bruce Health Unit info-line and cancelling a mass vaccination clinic on Saturday to redeploy staff to case management and contact tracing.

The province says 105,430 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine were administered since Wednesday's update, bringing the total number of vaccinations to 3,528,404.",929,5868,15,78

The facility was hit by an “act of sabotage” that Tehran blamed on Israel just a few days ago.

The news was broken by the speaker of the Iranian parliament, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, on Friday.

“I am proud to announce that at 00:40 … Iranian scientists were able to produce 60%-enriched uranium,” the speaker said on Twitter.

The achievement was confirmed by the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Ali Akbar Salehi. The official said the 60% uranium enrichment process was “underway at the Martyr Ahmadi Roshan nuclear facility,” referring to the Natanz plant.

“We are producing about nine grams of 60% enriched uranium an hour,” Salehi said. “But we have to work on arrangements to drop it to five grams per hour.”

“60% enrichment is an answer to your evilness,” Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani has said, as he promised to “cut both hands” of Iran’s enemies with the sharp enrichment hike.

The Natanz facility suffered a major power outage last Sunday, which resulted in damage to a number of uranium-enriching centrifuges. Tehran has promised to replace the damaged equipment, as well as to install additional devices at the facility in the aftermath of the suspected attack, which it blamed squarely on Israel. While Israeli involvement in the incident was reported by multiple US and Israeli outlets, Tel Aviv has remained silent on the matter.

The incident came amid talks in Vienna that had been attempting to revive the long-comatose 2015 nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The deal effectively fell apart after then-US President Donald Trump pulled out in early 2018, accusing Tehran of violating its “spirit.” Since then, Washington has imposed numerous sanctions on Tehran, and Iran has gradually expanded its nuclear activities.

While Tehran accused its alleged attackers of trying to undermine its negotiating position via the sabotage at Natanz, European signatories to the JCPOA were more alarmed at the 60% enrichment move.

“This is a serious development, since the production of highly enriched uranium constitutes an important step in the production of a nuclear weapon. Iran has no credible civilian need for enrichment at this level,” the UK, Germany, and France said in a joint statement on Wednesday.

Tehran dismissed such concerns, reiterating that its nuclear program pursues only civilian and peaceful goals. “We could have done 60% [enrichment] before. Today, we can do 90% enrichment if we want to, but we are not seeking a nuclear bomb,” Rouhani said on Thursday.

India reported a record 200,739 Covid-19 cases over the last 24 hours, according to the country’s Ministry of Health earlier today.

Deaths climbed to 1,038, taking the total to 173,123, while total infections have hit just over 14.1m cases, according to the latest official data.

The coronavirus is spreading much faster in India than anywhere else in the world. On Monday, the government revealed nearly 162,000 new infections had been recorded, followed by another 150,000 on Tuesday.

Despite the surge in new cases, mass gatherings and large events are still permitted and taking place all across the country.

Millions celebrate in Haridwar

This week, around three million Hindus have started to come together in the north Indian city of Haridwar, celebrating an auspicious bathing day in the Ganges river.

There are no restrictions at the week-long event, which started on Monday and takes place every 12 years, and officials acknowledged to local media it was impossible for attendees to maintain social distancing.

A senior police official told ANI news agency that it was very difficult to ensure social distancing on the river banks.

“Due to the huge crowd, it is practically not possible to issue challans [fines],” a police officer told ANI news agency. In fact, he warned that a “stampede-like situation” could arise if the police tried to intervene.

As a result, hundreds of attendees tested positive on Tuesday and yesterday. Officials said around one million people were bathing together yesterday afternoon, while another million are expected to repeat the ritual in the Ganges today.

Local police confirmed that nine religious leaders also tested positive yesterday, including Narendra Giri, the president of 14 Hindu groups. He has been admitted to a local hospital in Haridwar.

In addition, a former chief minister of the state of Uttar Pradesh, who attended the gathering earlier in the week, has repotedly tested positive, as well as the statre’s current chief minister.

Akhilesh Yadav, former chief minister of neighbouring Uttar Pradesh state, has also tested positive. He visited Haridwar on Sunday and met some top saints, including Mr Giri.

Yogi Adityanath, the current chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, has also tested positive although he did not visit the festival.

Covid across India

Mumbai, the beating heart of India’s economy, is currently the epicentre of the Covid-19 outbreak and the health minister of the local state, Maharashtra, warned yesterday new restrictions and a possible state-wide lockdown may be coming.

However, so far the populist government of prime minister Narendra Modi has failed to act and has given no indication it plans to take any new measures that may curb new infections.

1,Ornithologists Discover Owls Just Bounce Off Your Windshield On The Highway Sometimes,https://www.theonion.com/ornithologists-discover-owls-just-bounce-off-your-winds-1844845440,"ANN ARBOR, MI—In a report issued Thursday from a stretch of U.S. 23 South, Wilson Ornithological Society researchers shared new data that suggests owls just bounce off your windshield right there on the highway sometimes. “According to our research, it is possible for an owl to come out of nowhere, slam face-first into your car, and then ricochet back off into the night before you even realize what has occurred,” said Professor Jarrett Miller, a member of the four-person team of ornithologists who collected the data, which indicates the nocturnal bird of prey makes a surprisingly loud twhapping sound as it strikes the glass of an automobile traveling 70 mph. “Our group of avian experts discovered that it’s pretty nuts when it happens, with at least 75% of vehicle occupants turning to each other and saying, ‘Whoa!’ or ‘What the hell?’ While we’ve previously recorded instances of these majestic creatures hunting and roosting, we now know they’re also capable of getting smacked pretty hard by a Honda Accord and then spinning away in a tangled blur of feathers. They don’t squawk or anything; they just kind of go ‘thunk.’” Because the researchers were reportedly late for a conference and did not stop to look for the owl, they were unable to confirm their hypothesis that the bird’s hollow bones had probably fractured into thousands of really tiny shards.",228,1370,12,85

It would be the first time that Lai, one of Hong Kong’s most prominent democratic activists, who has been in jail since December after being denied bail in a separate national security trial, will receive a sentence.

ADVERTISEMENT

About 100 people, including foreign diplomats, queued outside the court early on Friday to get a seat for the hearing.

Lai was found guilty in two separate trials earlier in April for illegal assemblies on August 18 and August 31, 2019, respectively. The maximum possible punishment is five years in prison.

His repeated arrests have drawn criticism from Western governments and international rights groups, who raised concerns over waning freedoms in the global financial hub, including freedom of speech and assembly.

In the Aug. 18 case, District Court Judge Amanda Woodcock found him guilty together with Martin Lee, who helped launch the city’s largest opposition Democratic Party in the 1990s and is often called the former British colony’s “father of democracy.”

As he entered the court on Friday, Lee said: “I feel completely relaxed, I’m ready to face my sentence.”

The other defendants, also found guilty, included prominent barrister Margaret Ng and veteran democrats Lee Cheuk-yan, Albert Ho, Leung Kwok-hung, Cyd Ho, Au Nok-hin, and Leung Yiu-chung. The latter two had pleaded guilty.

In her mitigation speech, Ng said the law must not only be defended in courts or the legislature, but also in the streets.

“When the people, in the last resort, had to give collective expression to their anguish and urge the government to respond, protected only by their expectation that the government will respect their rights, I must be prepared to stand with them, stand by them and stand up for them,” she said.

In the second trial, the same judge found Lai and Lee Cheuk-yan guilty together with Yeung Sum. The Aug. 31 clashes were some of Hong Kong’s worst, with police firing tear gas and water cannons at pro-democracy protesters who threw petrol bombs.

All three had pleaded guilty.

Lee Cheuk-yan posted on Facebook late on Thursday that he expected to go to jail but that his mind was “free as the ocean and the sky.”

The 2019 pro-democracy protests were spurred by Beijing’s tightening squeeze on wide-ranging freedoms promised to Hong Kong upon its return to Chinese rule in 1997, and plunged the semi-autonomous city into its biggest crisis since the handover.

Beijing has since consolidated its authoritarian grip on Hong Kong by imposing a sweeping national security law, punishing anything it deems as secession, subversion, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.

Supporters of the law say it has restored stability.

Lai, founder of the Apple Daily tabloid, has been a frequent visitor to Washington, meeting officials such as former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to rally support for Hong Kong democracy, prompting Beijing to label him a “traitor”.

Lai is scheduled for two more court mentions on Friday, in the ongoing trial where he is charged with collusion with a foreign country and a fraud case related to the lease of the building which houses Apple Daily.

Earlier this week, the tabloid published a hand-written letter Lai sent to his colleagues from prison, saying: “It is our responsibility as journalists to seek justice. As long as we are not blinded by unjust temptations, as long as we do not let evil get its way through us, we are fulfilling our responsibility.”

It is “time for us to stand tall,” he wrote.

Bush administration reunited on Zoom Monday for a table read of the National Intelligence Assessment used to justify the invasion of Iraq. “The country’s going through some difficult times right now, and we just thought it would be fun to get the old gang back together to read the document that kicked off Operation Iraqi Freedom all those years ago,” said former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld of the reunion special that was broadcast live on YouTube and included key players Paul Wolfowitz, Dick Cheney, and even longtime holdout Colin Powell reprising their classic roles from the original military intervention. “I have to admit, I was shocked when I first sat down to re-read it, because so much of what was originally on the page never even ended up getting broadcast to America—some of the most memorable lines, like the ones about Saddam’s nuclear capabilities or the links to al Qaeda, were just riffs that we made up on the fly. So, it was a bit of a challenge to recreate that energy 17 years later and over the internet, but pretty soon we got back in the swing of things and started having as much fun as ever—honestly, it’s wild, some of the stuff they let us get away with back then. And sure, not all of it holds up, but I think people will get a real nostalgia boost out of reliving one of the undisputed highlights of the early 2000s.” Rumsfeld added that thanks to a generous outpouring of support by viewers, the table read had successfully raised over $20 million for The Heritage Foundation.",289,1640,17,107

The other week, I read that the founder of the National Vanguard is in the clink for having child pornography in his computer. What is going on with today's white nationalists? Here it is, 2007, and global Aryan supremacy is no closer to becoming a reality than it was 60 years ago. I lay the blame squarely on the shoulders of this new generation. These kids today are making a disgrace of neo-Nazism.

In my day, it wasn't just about mindless hate—we hated because we stood for something. Namely, tradition, discipline, and self-respect: values that these low-life punks have no comprehension of whatsoever. We exalted our glorious forebears, in Germany as well as the United States. But who today remembers the great American neo-Nazi leaders like George Lincoln Rockwell or Matt Koehl? Who honors the great heroes and martyrs of the National Socialist White People's Party?

It's enough to make me ashamed to be a neo-Nazi.

You can't just call yourself the Master Race—you have to act like it, and hold yourself to a higher standard than those you despise and wish to exterminate. Have you seen the way these kids dress? Their idea of a ""uniform"" is a T-shirt and combat boots. The rural militias are even worse, with their filthy fatigues and long hair and beer guts. Excuse me, but I hardly think hillbilly rejects are what our great Führer had in mind when he dreamed of a world filled with Aryan supermen. I wouldn't even let them in my front door, let alone conspire with them to blow up a synagogue.

Don't these people have any white pride?

And don't get me started on the whole ""skinhead"" thing. What idiot came up with that idea? When everybody's bald, you can't even tell who's blond. Back in the '70s, we combed our hair neatly, wore starched, pressed brown shirts, and polished our jackboots until you could use them as mirrors. We always looked presentable, even when beating up Mexican migrant workers or sending hate mail to Jewish leaders. And if there was an organizational meeting, by golly, you showed up for it. If you were given a task, you did it: Those leaflets didn't pass themselves out.

Of course, that was back when being a neo-Nazi still meant something. Evidently, the neo-Nazis of today think that all you need to do to keep the fires of white nationalism burning is to carve a swastika on your chest or strap an armband around the sleeve of a dingy plaid-flannel shirt.

Breaking bottles, overturning garbage cans, spray-painting racial slurs, cranking out hour after mind-numbing hour of that ridiculous punk-rock music—you call that neo-Nazism? When we wanted to relax after a long day of marching in downtown Skokie, we sang good patriotic German anthems like the ""Horst Wessel Song.""

Advertisement

And the way these kids fight! Where's the skill? Sure, in the glory days of the 1930s, the Nazis doled out their fair share of beatings against the defenseless. But they did it with a little thing called ""class."" Watching these kids throw drunken punches and thrash around like netted trout in their mosh pits, I'd be shocked if more than three of them could even goose-step in a straight line. They couldn't make a train run on time if their lives depended on it, let alone conceive the V-2 rocket or Zyklon B.

I'll tell you one other thing—we weren't parked on our butts typing away on the Internet all day in some dank room surrounded by empty beer cans. We were at our remote Montana compounds, enjoying the rugged outdoors. We went on nature hikes, built huge bonfires, and held daily target practice so we'd be ready for the coming race war. All these nerds today want to do is make Web videos decrying the Zionist agenda. That reminds me—if you're going to appear online, the least you can do is shave. And if you must tattoo an eagle with an iron cross in its talons across your back, put on a shirt, for crying out loud. Tattoos aren't anything to brag about. Tattoos are for inking numbers on the forearms of Jews.

I also hear that when these kids are in prison, they spend their time sodomizing each other. Why, when we were in prison, we took advantage of our extra time to write manifestos and memorize The Turner Diaries. Buggery was the furthest thing from our mind—we saved our essence for propagating the white race when we got out.

I suppose this new generation will probably call me an old geezer, just because I still believe in putting on a tie before giving the Hitler salute. But damn it, if we can't live up to the values that made Nazism great, we might as well just not have any neo-Nazi movement at all.",811,4635,7,47
0,Russia Will Expel Diplomats in Retaliation for U.S. Sanctions,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/world/europe/russia-expels-diplomats-sanctions.html,"MOSCOW — The Russian government will expel 10 American diplomats and threatened to crack down on U.S.-funded nongovernmental organizations in retaliation for sanctions announced this week by the Biden administration, Russia’s foreign minister said Friday.

The foreign ministry also offered what it called a suggestion that the American ambassador temporarily return to Washington and it banned entry into Russia by eight current and former United States officials, Sergey V. Lavrov, the foreign minister, said.

The response, mostly mirroring the diplomatic rebuke by the United States from the day before, suggested the Russian government did not intend an escalation that could worsen already dismal relations between the countries. Those relations have frayed in good part over Russian cyberattacks and interference in American elections.

President Biden had indicated that the new American sanctions would signal a harder line toward Moscow, though he left a door open for dialogue, after years of deferential treatment under the Trump administration. Mr. Lavrov called the sanctions an “absolutely unfriendly and unprovoked action.”",166,1139,9,61

Iran’s nuclear chief Ali Akbar Salehi says Tehran has started 60 percent uranium enrichment at Natanz nuclear facility, days after an explosion at the site that Tehran blamed on Israel.

“We are now getting nine grams [almost a third of an ounce] per hour,” Ali Akbar Salehi of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran said on state television, after Tasnim news agency reported that production was under way at the Natanz nuclear facility.

Earlier, the speaker of Iran’s parliament said Iranian scientists had successfully started enriching 60 percent uranium at 12.40am (20:10 GMT on Thursday).

The comment by Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, quoted by state television, did not elaborate on the amount Iran planned to enrich.

However, it is likely to raise tensions even as Iran negotiates with world powers in Vienna over a way to allow the US back into the agreement and lift the crushing economic sanctions it faces.

The announcement also marks a significant escalation after the sabotage that damaged centrifuges in an attack this past weekend.

While Israel has yet to claim it, the country is widely suspected of having carried out the still-unexplained sabotage at Natanz, Iran’s main enrichment site.

“The will of the Iranian nation is a miracle-maker and it will defuse any conspiracy,” state television quoted Qalibaf as saying.

While 60 percent is higher than any level Iran previously enriched uranium, it is still lower than weapons-grade levels of 90 percent.

Iran had been enriching up to 20 percent – even that was a short technical step to weapons-grade. The deal limited Iran’s enrichment to 3.67 percent.

Reporting from Tehran, Al Jazeera’s Assed Baig said, “It is important to note that this is the highest level of enrichment that Iran has ever done.

“It seems to be in response to the incident at the main nuclear facility in Natanz.

“If we look at the 20 percent enrichment, that was in response to the assassination of the Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsin Fakhrizadeh in November,” explained Baig.

“Iran’s line is that it [the enrichment of uranium at 60 percent] is for medical use, but the EU has said there is no need for Iran to enrich to 60 percent. In reality, it could be as leverage in the nuclear talks in Vienna,” he added.

The move could inspire a further response from Israel amid a long-running shadow war between the nations.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged never to allow Tehran to obtain a nuclear weapon and his country has twice pre-emptively bombed Middle East nations to stop their atomic programmes.

Tehran has maintained that its nuclear programme is peaceful and it does not aim to build an atomic bomb.",464,2800,14,79
0,Jaffa: Arabs clash with Jewish protesters after attack on rabbi,https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/304584,"Members of the local Religious Zionist community in Jaffa gathered Sunday evening to protest the attack on two yeshiva officials earlier today.

Protesters denounced the violent assault on Rabbi Eliyahu Mali and Moshe Schendowich, and called on authorities to take a firm hand against lawlessness in Jaffa.

Some protesters struck a defiant tone, saying that the local religious community would not be bullied or driven out by Arab attacks. “You won’t defeat us that easily,” protesters said.

A group of Arab counter-protesters also gathered, chanting ""Settlers, go home,"" and ""Allahu Akbar"".

The Arab counter-demonstration turned violent at one point, with some rioters hurling stones and shooting fireworks at the Jewish demonstrators and at police.

Officers kept the two groups separated from each other during the demonstration.

Rabbi Mali, the dean of the local Hesder yeshiva, and Schendowich, the yeshiva’s director, were attacked Sunday afternoon on a Jaffa Street by a group of local Arab men.

The assailants beat and kicked the two yeshiva officials while the two were en route to inspect a local property the yeshiva is purchasing from a Jewish seller.

The attackers surrounded the two and proceeded to harass and mock Rabbi Mali and Schendowich.

When Rabbi Mali and Schendowich took out their cellular phones to call for help, several of the Arabs assaulted them, punching and kicking the two victims.

Schendowich was injured in the attack, and was hospitalized afterwards.

Rabbi Mali filed a police complaint shortly after the assault.

Roughly one hour after the complaint was filed, police managed to locate and apprehend two Arab suspects.

The suspects have been identified as residents of Jaffa in their 30s.

“They punched and kicked me,” said Schendowich in an interview with Channel 13, emphasizing that the attack was nationalistically-motivated. “When people scream at you because you’re wearing a kippah, that you’re a ‘settler’ and that you should get out of there, that doesn’t seem like a ‘criminal’ incident.”

Diaspora Minister Omer Yankelevich (Blue and White) warned of a “quiet Intifada” targeting religious Jews.

“Under our noses there has been a quiet Intifada against visibly religious or haredi Jews. I call on the police to crush this violence with an iron fist. Jews shouldn’t have to be afraid to go in the street. We’re finished with the exile.”",380,2395,10,63

The central European country expelled 18 Russian embassy staff on Saturday over the issue and said investigations had linked Russian intelligence to the explosion, which killed two people.

Russia's Interfax news agency cited Vladimir Dzhabarov, first deputy head of the Russian upper house's international affairs committee, on Saturday as saying Prague's assertions were absurd and Russia's response should be proportionate.

Meanwhile, another high-profile official, Leonid Slutsky, chairman of the State Duma's international affairs committee, said Saturday the grounds for the Czech move “do not stand up to criticism,” adding that the Czech Republic follows “the Russophobic course of the United States” by expelling Russian diplomats, Russian state news agency Tass reported.

The expulsions and allegations come at a time of heightened Russian-Western tensions and have triggered the biggest dispute between the Czechs and Russia since the 1989 end of Communist rule, when Prague was under Moscow's domination for decades.

On Sunday, the E.U.'s executive commission confirmed remarks by acting Czech Foreign Minister Jan Hamacek on Twitter that the dispute would be addressed during a previously schedule E.U. foreign ministers' video conference on Monday.

Separately, Czech police said they were searching for two men in connection with serious criminal activity who were carrying Russian passports in the names of Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, and that the men were in the country in the days leading up to the 2014 explosion.

Those were the aliases used by two Russian military intelligence (GRU) officers who British prosecutors charged with the attempted poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia with the nerve agent Novichok in the English city of Salisbury in 2018.

Moscow has denied involvement in that incident.

The United States and Britain said they stood in full solidarity with the Czech Republic in the dispute with Russia.

A statement by the U.S. Embassy in Prague said on Saturday Washington ""stands with its steadfast ally, the Czech Republic. We appreciate their significant action to impose costs on Russia for its dangerous actions on Czech soil.""

Meanwhile, British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Twitter: ""The U.K. stands in full support of our Czech allies, who have exposed the lengths that the GRU will go to in their attempts to conduct dangerous and malign operations – and highlights a disturbing pattern of behaviour following the attack in Salisbury.""

The Kremlin’s relations with many NATO members, most of whom are in the E.U., as well as the United States are more strained that at any time since the Cold War.

The West has voiced alarm over a large Russian military build-up on Russia's Western borders and in Crimea, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014, following a spike in fighting in eastern Ukraine between Russian-backed separatists and government forces.

The United States imposed sanctions against Russia this week for interfering in last year's U.S. election, cyber hacking, bullying Ukraine and other alleged malign actions, prompting Moscow to retaliate.

Last month U.S. President Joe Biden said he thought his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin was a ""killer"" and Moscow recalled its ambassador to Washington for consultations.",564,3648,32,201
1,Study Finds It Would Be Extremely Satisfying To Have Intercourse With An A-List Celebrity,https://www.theonion.com/study-finds-it-would-be-extremely-satisfying-to-have-in-1844244391,"BOULDER, CO—Providing groundbreaking new insight into human sexuality, a study published Thursday by researchers at the University of Colorado found that if a person were to engage in intercourse with an A-list celebrity, the experience would be extremely satisfying. “Over the course of our inquiry, we concluded that having intimate sexual relations with, for example, Rihanna, would result in a marked improvement in one’s general mood and overall sense of well-being,” said Professor Liza Mulbin, explaining that the euphoric effect that comes from sex with a top-tier celebrity one has seen on television or in films can likely be attributed to the fact that such individuals are very attractive, very famous, and very rich. “It would, in all likelihood, be the best feeling ever. Our analysis also shows that, given how often celebrities like Ryan Gosling, Selena Gomez, and the Hemsworth brothers have sex, they are probably incredible at it. In addition, a degree of status is conferred upon anyone who has sex with a major star, as they are forever known within their social group as the one who had sex with Drake or Kristen Stewart.” Mulbin added that even in the worst-case scenario, in which a person contracts an incurable STI from an A-list celebrity, the accompanying sexual gratification would still “totally be worth it.”

US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday that he would withdraw all remaining US troops – about 2,500 – from Afghanistan by September 11, the 20th anniversary of the terrorist attack in New York.

The withdrawal may pose a threat to Afghanistan’s security and stability, which could spill over into Xinjiang and disrupt China’s counterterrorism efforts.

In 2018, China trained Afghan troops and helped set up a mountain brigade. The training took place in China and the aim of the brigade was to counter possible attacks by al-Qaeda and Islamic State.

“The security forces of the Afghan government are not capable of ensuring Afghan security,” said Sun Qi, an international relations specialist at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences.

“The situation in Afghanistan might go further into chaos in the future. Cross-border crime, drug trafficking and smuggling of firearms may proliferate,” he said.

While Beijing would not station troops in Afghanistan, it might work with other countries in the region to promote political stability and reduce the security risk to China, Sun said.

“If the security situation poses a significant threat, China may send peacekeeping troops along with humanitarian assistance to the region under the terms of the Charter of the United Nations to ensure the safety and interests of Chinese people and companies there,” he said.

Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Thursday that foreign troops stationed in Afghanistan should withdraw in a “responsible and orderly manner” to prevent terrorist forces from taking advantage of the chaos.

“The United States is the biggest external factor affecting the Afghan issue. The relevant decisions and actions of the United States should fully respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Afghanistan, earnestly take responsibility for maintaining the results of peace and reconstruction in Afghanistan,” he said.

Soon after Biden’s announcement, Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance planned to withdraw its troops – about 7,000 – from Afghanistan by next month. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Thursday that Australia would also complete its military withdrawal from Afghanistan in September.

Other experts said China was unlikely to push too hard to gain influence in Afghanistan as there was already fierce competition in the region.

“A number of countries, including Pakistan, India and Russia, want to exert their influence in the region, so China really needs to be careful of getting involved in the chaos,” said Wang Jin, a research fellow at the Charhar Institute think tank in northern China.

China and the US were unlikely to engage in any significant cooperation in Afghanistan after the US troop withdrawal, given the tensions between the two countries, he said.

“We can see from the withdrawal of US troops that the willingness of the US to intervene in Afghanistan’s affairs is declining,” he said.

“Primarily because the idea of solving local conflicts by establishing a Western-style democracy in Afghanistan has failed.”

Sun said the US was likely to withdraw its military deployments from Central Asia and redeploy them to the Asia-Pacific.

“The withdrawal from Afghanistan allows the US to boost its military presence in Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean regions, with the aim of containing China,” he said.

“The US is highly likely to increase its military activity in the South China Sea and China-Indochina peninsula.”

(Planet Labs via AP)

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran began enriching uranium Friday to its highest-ever purity, edging close to weapons-grade levels, as it attempts to pressure negotiators in Vienna during talks on restoring its nuclear deal with world powers after an attack on its main enrichment site.

A top official said only a few grams an hour of uranium gas would be enriched up to 60% purity — triple its previous level but at a quantity far lower than what the Islamic Republic had been able to produce. Iran also is enriching at an above-ground facility at its Natanz nuclear site already visited by international inspectors, not deep within underground halls hardened to withstand airstrikes.

The narrow scope of the new enrichment provides Iran with a way to quickly de-escalate if it chooses, experts say, but time is narrowing. An Iranian presidential election looms on the horizon as Tehran already threatens to limit international inspections. Israel, suspected of carrying out Sunday’s sabotage at Natanz, also could act again amid a long-running shadow war between the two Middle East rivals.

Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, Iran’s parliament speaker, announced the higher enrichment on Twitter.

“The young and God-believing Iranian scientists managed to achieve a 60% enriched uranium product,” Qalibaf said. “I congratulate the brave nation of Islamic Iran on this success. The Iranian nation’s willpower is miraculous and can defuse any conspiracy.”

The head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, the country’s civilian nuclear arm, later acknowledged the move to 60%. Ali Akbar Salehi told Iranian state television the centrifuges now produce 9 grams an hour, but that would drop to 5 grams an hour in the coming days.

“Any enrichment level that we desire is in our reach at the moment and we can do it at any time we want,” Salehi said.

It wasn’t clear why the first announcement came from Qalibaf, a hard-line former leader in the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard already named as a potential presidential candidate in Iran’s upcoming June election .

While 60% is higher than any level Iran previously enriched uranium, it is still lower than weapons-grade levels of 90%. Iran had been enriching up to 20% — and even that was a short technical step to weapons-grade. The deal limited Iran’s enrichment to 3.67%.

The International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors Iran’s nuclear program, did not respond to a request for comment. Earlier this week, it sent its inspectors to Natanz and confirmed Iran was preparing to begin 60% enrichment at an above-ground facility at the site.

ADVERTISEMENT

Israel, which has twice bombed Mideast countries to stop their nuclear programs, plans to hold a meeting of its top security officials Sunday over the Iranian announcement.

“Israel is determined to defend itself against any attempt to harm its sovereignty or citizens, and will do whatever it takes to prevent this radical and anti-Semitic regime from acquiring nuclear weapons,” Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi said in Cyprus.

Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful, though the West and the IAEA say Tehran had an organized military nuclear program up until the end of 2003. An annual U.S. intelligence report released Tuesday maintained the longtime American assessment that Iran isn’t currently trying to build a nuclear bomb.

Iran previously had said it could use uranium enriched up to 60% for nuclear-powered ships. However, the Islamic Republic currently has no such ships in its navy.

The threat of higher enrichment by Iran already had drawn criticism from the U.S. and three European nations in the deal — France, Germany and the United Kingdom. On Friday, European Union spokesman Peter Stano called Iran’s decision “a very worrisome development.”

Full Coverage: Iran

“There is no credible explanation or civilian justification for such an action on the side of Iran,” Stano said. The Vienna talks aim to “make sure that we go back from such steps that bring Iran further away from delivering on its commitments and obligations.”

Diplomats reconvened Friday in Vienna, with more talks planned Saturday, Russian representative Mikhail Ulyanov said. Chinese negotiator Wang Qun earlier called for doing “away with all disruptive factors by moving forward as swiftly as we can on the work of negotiations, especially by zeroing in on sanction lifting.”

The 2015 nuclear deal, which former President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from in 2018, prevented Iran from stockpiling enough high-enriched uranium to be able to pursue a nuclear weapon if it chose in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.

In Washington, President Joe Biden said Tehran’s latest step was contrary to the deal. “We do not support and do not think it’s at all helpful,” he said. But he added that the Vienna talks had not been sidetracked.

“We are nonetheless pleased that Iran has agreed to continue to engage in indirect discussions with us on how we move forward and what is needed to get back” into the nuclear deal, he said. “It’s premature to make a judgment as to what the outcome will be, but we’re still talking.”

The weekend attack at Natanz was initially described only as a blackout in its electrical grid — but later Iranian officials began calling it an attack.

One Iranian official referred to “several thousand centrifuges damaged and destroyed” in a state TV interview. However, no other official has offered that figure and no images of the aftermath have been released.

In the coming weeks, Iran has threatened to further impede IAEA inspections and potentially destroy video recordings it now holds of its facilities . Meanwhile, it continues to use advanced centrifuges and gain know-how in high enrichment, something that worries nonproliferation experts.

“Because the deal has started to unravel, Iran has begun to acquire more knowledge about how to operate more advanced machines,” said Daryl G. Kimball, the executive director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association. “This particular operation, enriching to 60%, is going to give it even more information.”

Borrowing a term used to describe diluting high-enriched uranium, Kimball added: “That knowledge cannot be down-blended. It cannot be reversed.”

0,How the Kremlin provides a safe harbor for ransomware,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/kremlin-provides-safe-harbor-ransomware-rcna699,"A global epidemic of digital extortion known as ransomware is crippling local governments, hospitals, school districts and businesses by scrambling their data files until they pay up. Law enforcement has been largely powerless to stop it.

One big reason: Ransomware rackets are dominated by Russian-speaking cybercriminals who are shielded — and sometimes employed — by Russian intelligence agencies, according to security researchers, U.S. law enforcement, and now the Biden administration.

On Thursday, as the U.S. slapped sanctions on Russia for malign activities including state-backed hacking, the Treasury Department said Russian intelligence has enabled ransomware attacks by cultivating and co-opting criminal hackers and giving them safe harbor. With ransomware damages now well into the tens of billions of dollars, former British intelligence cyber chief Marcus Willett recently deemed the scourge “arguably more strategically damaging than state cyber-spying.”

The value of Kremlin protection isn’t lost on the cybercriminals themselves. Earlier this year, a Russian-language dark-web forum lit up with criticism of a ransomware purveyor known only as “Bugatti,” whose gang had been caught in a rare U.S.-Europol sting. The assembled posters accused him of inviting the crackdown with technical sloppiness and by recruiting non-Russian affiliates who might be snitches or undercover cops.

Worst of all, in the view of one long-active forum member, Bugatti had allowed Western authorities to seize ransomware servers that could have been sheltered in Russia instead. “Mother Russia will help,” that individual wrote. “Love your country and nothing will happen to you.” The conversation was captured by the security firm Advanced Intelligence, which shared it with the Associated Press.

“Like almost any major industry in Russia, (cybercriminals) work kind of with the tacit consent and sometimes explicit consent of the security services,” said Michael van Landingham, a former CIA analyst who runs the consultancy Active Measures LLC.

Russian authorities have a simple rule, said Karen Kazaryan, CEO of the software industry-supported Internet Research Institute in Moscow: “Just don’t ever work against your country and businesses in this country. If you steal something from Americans, that’s fine.”

Unlike North Korea, there is no indication Russia’s government benefits directly from ransomware crime, although Russian President Vladimir Putin may consider the resulting havoc a strategic bonus.

In the U.S. alone last year, ransomware struck more than a hundred federal, state and municipal agencies, upward of 500 hospitals and other health care centers, some 1,680 schools, colleges and universities and hundreds of businesses, according to t he cybersecurity firm Emsisoft.

Damage in the public sector alone is measured in rerouted ambulances, postponed cancer treatments, interrupted municipal bill collection, canceled classes and rising insurance costs – all during the worst public health crisis in more than a century.

The idea behind these attacks is simple: Criminals infiltrate malicious data-scrambling software into computer networks, use it to “kidnap” an organization’s data files, then demand huge payments, now as high as $50 million, to restore them. The latest twist: if victims fail to pay up, the criminals may publish their unscrambled data on the open internet.

In recent months, U.S. law enforcement has worked with partners including Ukraine and Bulgaria to bust up these networks. But with the criminal masterminds out of reach, such operations are generally little more than whac-a-mole.

Collusion between criminals and the government is nothing new in Russia, said Adam Hickey, a U.S. deputy assistant attorney general, who noted that cybercrime can provide good cover for espionage.

Back in the 1990s, Russian intelligence frequently recruited hackers for that purpose, said Kazaryan. Now, he said, ransomware criminals are just as likely to be moonlighting state-employed hackers.

The Kremlin sometimes enlists arrested criminal hackers by offering them a choice between prison and working for the state, said Dmitri Alperovitch, former chief technical officer of the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike. Sometimes the hackers use the same computer systems for state-sanctioned hacking and off-the-clock cybercrime for personal enrichment, he said. They may even mix state with personal business.

That’s what happened in a 2014 hack of Yahoo that compromised more than 500 million user accounts, allegedly including those of Russian journalists and U.S. and Russian government officials. A U.S. investigation led to the 2017 indictment of four men, including two officers of Russia’s FSB security service – a successor to the KGB. One of them, Dmitry Dokuchaev, worked in the same FSB office that cooperates with the FBI on computer crime. Another defendant, Alexsey Belan, allegedly used the hack for personal gain.

A Russian Embassy spokesman declined to address questions about his government’s alleged ties to ransomware criminals and state employees’ alleged involvement in cybercrime. “We do not comment on any indictments or rumors,” said Anton Azizov, the deputy press attache in Washington.

Proving links between the Russian state and ransomware gangs is not easy. The criminals hide behind pseudonyms and periodically change the names of their malware strains to confuse Western law enforcement.

But at least one ransomware purveyor has been linked to the Kremlin. Maksim Yakubets, 33, is best known as co-leader of a cybergang that cockily calls itself Evil Corp. The Ukraine-born Yakubets lives a flashy lifestyle, He drives a customized Lamborghini supercar with a personalized number plate that translates to ‘Thief,’ according to Britain’s National Crime Agency.

Yakubets started working for the FSB in 2017, tasked with projects including “acquiring confidential documents through cyber-enabled means and conducting cyber-enabled operations on its behalf,” according to a December 2019 U.S. indictment. At the same time, the U.S. Treasury Department slapped sanctions on Yakubets and offered a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture. It said he was known to have been “in the process of obtaining a license to work with Russian classified information from the FSB.”

The indictment charged Evil Corp. with developing and distributing ransomware used to steal at least $100 million in more than 40 countries over the previous decade, including payrolls pilfered from towns in the American heartland.

By the time Yakubets was indicted, Evil Corp. had become a major ransomware player, security researchers say. By May 2020, the gang was distributing a ransomware strain that was used to attack eight Fortune 500 companies, including the GPS device maker Garmin, whose network was offline for days after an attack, according to Advanced Intelligence.

Yakubets remains at large. Another Russian currently imprisoned in France, however, might offer more insight into the dealings of cybercriminals and the Russian state. Alexander Vinnik was convicted of laundering $160 million in criminal proceeds through a cryptocurrency exchange called BTC-e. A 2017 U.S. indictment charged that “some of the largest known purveyors of ransomware” actually used it to launder $4 billion. But Vinnik can’t be extradited until he completes his 5-year French prison sentence in 2024.

Still, a 2018 study by the nonpartisan think tank Third Way found the odds of successfully prosecuting authors of cyberattacks against U.S. targets — ransomware and online bank theft are the costliest — are no better than three in a thousand. Experts say that those odds have gotten longer.

This week’s sanctions send a strong message, but aren’t likely to deter Putin unless the financial sting hits closer to home, many analysts believe.

That might require the kind of massive multinational coordination that followed the 9/11 terror attacks. For instance, allied countries could identify banking institutions known to launder ransomware proceeds and cut them off from the global financial community.

“If you’re able to follow the money and disrupt the money and take the economic incentive out, that’ll go a long way in stopping ransomware attacks,” said John Riggi, cybersecurity advisor for the American Hospital Association and a former FBI official.",1263,8421,9,53

1,Bush Calls For Panic,https://politics.theonion.com/bush-calls-for-panic-1819570290,"WASHINGTON—In a nationally televised address to the American people Wednesday night, President Bush called upon every man, woman, and child to spiral uncontrollably downward into complete and utter panic.

President Bush addresses the nation shortly before shaving his head and soaking the Oval Office in his own urine.

Speaking from the Oval Office, Bush assured citizens that in these times of great uncertainty, the best and only course of action is to come under the throes of a sudden, overwhelming fear marked by hysterical or irrational behavior.

""My fellow Americans, the time for running aimlessly through streets while shrieking and waving our arms above our heads is now,"" Bush said. ""I understand that many of you are worried about your economic future and our situation overseas, and you have every right to be. Yet there is only one thing we as a nation can do in times like these: give up all hope and devolve into a lawless, post-apocalyptic, every-man-for-himself society.""

""For those of you who have remained resolute in your belief that things will turn around eventually, I urge you to close your eyes, take shallow rapid breaths, and begin freaking out immediately,"" Bush added. ""At this point, anyone who isn't scared to death needs to wake the fuck up—because we're screwed here.""

The president then picked up the telephone from his desk and hurled it through the Oval Office window.

During the address, Bush laid out a historic five-point plan for panic that he hopes will help the American people fall apart as quickly as possible. The plan—which many are calling Bush's most well-thought-out proposal to date—calls for citizens to abandon their daily routines entirely, and engage in a weeklong period of bloodcurdling screaming, arm flailing, dry heaving, and gnawing on one's fingers while rocking back and forth in alternating bouts of maniacal laughter and gentle sobbing.

Under the new bill, Americans are also advised to withdraw all their money from U.S. banks and the stock market, place it in a Maxwell House coffee tin, and bury it in a safe place in their backyard. In addition, Bush has urged the legalization of Americans trampling one another in a mad rush to compete for the nation's dwindling resources, and proposed allocating $3 billion toward a program that would give every citizen a gun and a bottle of 140-proof whiskey.

The final part of the plan calls for the immediate release of all convicted felons and death-row inmates from the nation's prisons.

Immediately after Congress approves his plan, the president said he will order multiple B-2 stealth bombers to fly over America's cities at low altitude. The resulting sonic boom, Bush said, will set off all car alarms and cause all babies to cry uncontrollably, which he believes will promote a real sense of chaos throughout the nation. In addition, Bush intends to release 50 live cobras into the Senate chamber.

""I realize this is a difficult vote for members of Congress, but at this critical time in our nation's history, it is imperative that we not sit back and pretend like everything is fine, because everything's not fine, it's just not,"" Bush said. ""Even if Congress fails to act, I still intend to do what is right and lead this country into mass hysteria by acting outside the framework of the U.S. Constitution, overriding the entire democratic process, and setting the Lincoln Memorial on fire.""

Early reactions on Capitol Hill to Bush's call for panic have thus far been positive. Leading House Republicans and Democrats said they appreciate the president's candor, and will encourage their constituents to comply with Bush's request to ""find something and smash it with all of their strength.""

""For most of the day tomorrow, I intend to do my part by remaining in my boarded-up home and getting worked up about our standing in the world,"" Pacoima, CA resident Harold Miller said. ""And then at night, I plan to lie awake in my bed and be scared to death about the loss of my job, pension, and retirement fund. Then I plan to run out into the streets in my bathrobe and shout that the End of Days is coming.""

CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — A woman who served a 10-year sentence in U.S. prison for lying about her role in the 1994 Rwandan genocide to obtain American citizenship, and then lost her bid for a new trial, has been deported to the East African nation and is likely to face prosecution there.

Beatrice Munyenyezi, who a U.S. judge said “was actively involved” in the killing of Tutsis in Rwanda, was convicted and sentenced in 2013 in New Hampshire. It was her second trial; the first jury could not reach a verdict. Munyenyezi served a 10-year sentence in Alabama and had faced deportation.

She lost her latest court battle in March, when the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a federal district judge’s rejection of her petition challenging how the jury was instructed during her trial in federal court in New Hampshire.

Her lawyer, Richard Guerriero, confirmed in an email Saturday that Munyenyezi had been deported to Rwanda. She arrived Friday and was handed over to Rwandan authorities, according to state-run media there.

“Her deportation means a lot in terms of justice delivery to genocide victims,” said Thierry Murangira, spokesperson for the Rwanda Investigation Bureau, according to The New Times.

Munyenyezi is accused of seven crimes connected to the genocide, including murder and complicity in rape, according to Rwandan investigators. She will be detained as investigations continue and her case sent to prosecutors, the newspaper reported.

In the United States, Munyenyezi was convicted of lying about her role as a commander of one of the notorious roadblocks where Tutsis were singled out for slaughter. She denied affiliation with any political party, despite the leadership role of her husband, Arsene Shalom Ntahobali, in the extremist Hutu militia party.

She requested a new trial based on a U.S. Supreme Court decision that came in 2017, well after her sentencing, and limited the government’s ability to strip citizenship from immigrants who lied during the naturalization process.

Munyenyezi alleged that the jury was given inaccurate instructions on her criminal liability. A judge denied her request, saying that even if the instruction fell short, the error was harmless.

As part of her appeal, Munyenyezi’s trial lawyers, who are now New Hampshire superior court judges, said in court documents that they would have presented Munyenyezi’s case differently if the U.S. Supreme Court decision had been law during her trial.

They added that they believe if the jury had been instructed based on the court decision, “the verdict may have been different.”

“Having served her sentence and lost her appeal, she was removed from the country,” Guerriero said in a statement. “It is possible a further challenge to her conviction may be filed despite her removal.”

Munyenyezi fled to Nairobi, Kenya, with a young daughter in July 1994 in the waning days of the genocide. She gave birth to twin girls there four months later. She entered the United States as a refugee and settled in Manchester, New Hampshire’s largest city.

She got a $13-an-hour job working for the city housing authority and earned an associate’s degree in college. She financed a comfortable lifestyle through mortgages, loans and credit cards, but filed for bankruptcy in 2008 and had about $400,000 in debt discharged.

Ntahobali and his mother were convicted of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes of violence and are serving life sentences. Both were deemed to be high-ranking members of the Hutu militia party, which orchestrated the attacks on Tutsis.

1,Nation Demands More Mind-Blowing Guitar Solos,https://entertainment.theonion.com/nation-demands-more-mind-blowing-guitar-solos-1819576265,"American citizens said they wanted a solo like Slash does on “Sweet Child O’ Mine,” but even faster.

WASHINGTON—Voicing their calls for heavy distortion and completely badass riffs, millions of Americans across the country fervently demanded a significant increase in the number of mind-blowing guitar solos Monday, sources nationwide confirmed.

Highlighting an unmistakable dearth of epic, amazing solos in recent years, Americans of all ages have reportedly called on the nation’s musicians to play technically difficult licks on their electric guitars, preferably at lightning-fast speeds, stressing the importance that the solos be both “loud as hell” and “totally insane.”

“When I turn on the radio, I want to hear a killer solo where the guy just totally shreds it hard,” said 36-year-old Kent, WA resident Michael Pellone, echoing the sentiments of the vast majority of citizens from coast to coast. “I want a solo so fast you can barely see the guy’s fingers moving—where the guy’s up on stage, one foot on top of a speaker, and just going nuts all over the guitar. That’s what I want.”

“And not one of those short solos either,” Pellone continued enthusiastically. “It’s gotta be, like, three minutes. Three minutes of this guy fucking wailing up there and making his guitar do those cool squealing sounds you hear a lot. Yeah, it has to have a lot of that.”

According to thousands of amped-up sources nationwide, a guitar solo in which the guy bends the strings really far while leaning his head back and grimacing is currently a top national priority. Additionally, citizens from all 50 states emphasized the importance of the guitarist running all over the stage, jumping off an amplifier, and then sliding on his knees through the lead singer’s legs while rocking out hard the entire time.

The U.S. populace also insisted that the solos contain several sections in which the guitarist uses his right hand to tap notes on the neck of the instrument just like Eddie Van Halen does in “Eruption.”

“I like when they’re just tearing it up on the low part of the guitar, but then they suddenly go up and play on the high part—they should do that lots of times,” said 31-year-old Mark Kessek of West Orange, NJ, adding that he really likes how it sounds when guitarists do long slides up and down the strings, so the solo should include a few of those. “I also like when they do that wah-wah effect thing—that has to be in there too. But the main thing is that it has to be really fast. So fast you’re just like, ‘Whoa, fuck yeah!’”

“Yeah!” added Kessek, excitedly making devil horns with his hands. “Pantera!”

According to a recent poll, 59 percent of Americans vehemently demanded that guitarists rip it up on a sweet double-neck guitar, frequently switching between the two fretboards like it’s nothing, while 84 percent called for an interlude midway through the solos during which another guitarist walks over and plays a cool harmony part alongside the lead. A further 73 percent said guitarists must at some point strum a really high note and simply let it ring while holding the guitar up with one hand, preferably while looking up and nodding at the crowd.

Moreover, 100 percent of respondents said that the guitarist should hit the whammy bar at the end of a particularly sick riff, with all respondents agreeing that such a maneuver would “kick ass.”

“What they should do is make the whole stage dark and then there’s a big spotlight on the guitarist guy, and there’s all this fog and smoke coming up around him too,” said 42-year-old Houston resident Samantha Pragle, noting that, ideally, the guitar should have some cool flames painted on it. “And it doesn’t just have to be one solo per song. A song could have a whole bunch of solos in it. Maybe the entire song could be a solo! Man, can you imagine how insane that would be? That would fucking rule!”

While unanimous in their demands for more unbelievable, earsplitting solos, the American public is reportedly divided over how the solos should end. According to sources, some have pressed for several amplifiers to be wildly kicked over after the last note, though others are staunchly in favor of seeing the soloist use his guitar strap to throw his instrument around his body, catch it, and then seamlessly transition into playing the song’s final chorus.

“I love guitar solos! I like when they play the guitar behind their head, just like this!” said Philadelphia accountant Alan Hurley, 57, closing his eyes and rapidly moving his fingers across an imaginary fretboard while making guitar sounds with his mouth. “Wa-na-na, neeow, wa-na, wa-now!”

“Wa-na-na-na,” Hurley added. “Na-na-neeow, wah-a-wow!”

At press time, tens of millions of enthusiastic Americans had reportedly cued up a YouTube video of Steve Vai’s “For The Love Of God” and cranked it all the way up.",828,4933,6,45

But Putin is racing to catch up.,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/russia-e2-80-99s-surveillance-state-still-doesn-e2-80-99t-match-china-but-putin-is-racing-to-catch-up/ar-BB1fKvTz,"© Natalia Kolesnikova/AFP/Getty Images A woman walks past a surveillance camera and a mosaic depicting the Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin at a Metro station in Moscow on March 10.

MOSCOW —Russian authorities are ramping up the use of facial recognition technology to track opposition protesters to their homes and arrest them — a powerful new Kremlin tool to crush opposition.

But when state security agents are suspected of murders or attacks on journalists and opposition activists, surveillance cameras have at times been switched off or “malfunction.”

And the system is so leaky that surveillance data on individuals can be bought for a small sum on Russia’s notorious black market in data, along with all kinds of other personal information. There is even a name for the clandestine cyber bazaar: probiv.

China leads the world in rolling out a vast network of facial recognition technology, including a system to track and repress its Uyghur minority. But Putin’s Russia is racing to catch up.

Russian firms such as NtechLab produce some of the world’s most sophisticated facial recognition software as authorities grapple with counterpunches by the opposition, including using social media to expose Russia’s kleptocracy, such as extravagances by Russian President Vladimir Putin’s political allies.

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said the facial recognition system — rolled out in Moscow en masse in January 2020 and expanded to at least 10 other Russian cities — is now used in 70 percent of crime investigations. Moscow has more than 189,000 cameras with facial recognition capabilities, as well as more than 12,300 on subway cars in Moscow’s Metro.

© KIRILL KUDRYAVTSEV/AFP via Getty Images Nikolai Grunin, an employee at NtechLab, the company that won Moscow’s tender to supply facial recognition technology, demonstrates the technology during an interview with AFP on Feb. 5, 2020.

“It is being used more and more against protesters and activists,” said Sarkis Darbinyan, a lawyer with Roskomsvoboda, a Moscow-based digital rights organization. “All these cameras scoop up the faces of people who go to a protest and then the information stays in the system.”

During protests in January and February over the jailing of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, Roskomsvoboda received more than a dozen reports of protesters arrested at home or in the subway, suggesting tracking by surveillance systems, Darbinyan said.

'Digital concentration camp'

Surveillance and facial recognition is increasingly used globally for law enforcement, raising alarm among civil liberties groups about privacy rights.

The FBI used facial recognition, surveillance video and other means to investigate the Jan. 6 attacks on the U.S. Capitol. In Britain, South Wales police lost a landmark case last year when an appeals court ruled that the technology violated a right to privacy and laws on equality.

But it’s a very different story in authoritarian states.

“Instead of the system being used for the benefit of the city, it is being used as a tool of total surveillance and total control of citizens,” said Sergei Abanichev, a protester who was jailed after being arrested using facial recognition.

He threw an empty paper cup in the direction of police at a protest in the summer of 2019, although he says he had no intention of causing harm. A week later, nine special forces police banged on the door of his apartment. He was charged with rioting and mass disorder. He served a month before the charges were dropped.

The ordeal was enough to deter him from taking part in this year’s protests, he said. Yet on Jan. 31, when more than 4,500 people were arrested during protests, police pounced on him in the Metro. They told him the Metro facial recognition system had activated a “high alert,” he said. He was interrogated for hours but eventually freed.

Spreading fear and deterring activism may be just the point for authorities, Darbinyan said.

“If somebody knows that he or she can be tracked down, they may change their behavior,” he said. “They may decide not to go to a rally, not to participate in a protest or maybe even not to go to the mosque for prayer, because they know that they can be tracked down.”

On Jan. 31, activist Kamil Galeyev was detained at his home three hours before a major protest started. The detention, he said, was based on photos of him through facial recognition from a Jan. 23 demonstration. He was jailed for 10 days.

Another activist, Mikhail Shulman, was picked up inside the Metro on Jan. 31 through facial recognition. It made him feel as if he lived in a “digital concentration camp,” he wrote in an article on Roskomsvoboda’s website.

Black market data

The facial recognition surveillance data goes into a central database, the Integrated Center for Data Processing and Storage, accessible by law enforcement and some bureaucrats. But corrupt officials sell data on Russia’s thriving “probiv” black market: flight records, cellphone records and other data.

It is used by Russian investigative journalists researching alleged abuses by officials, as well as criminals tracking potential targets and snoops checking up on rivals, spouses, employees or business partners.

“Often, it’s not the government or the authorities who have the access to the data, but criminals,” said Mikhail Klimarev, executive director of the Internet Protection Society, a nongovernmental organization exposing abuses of the Internet by Russian authorities.

© Mikhail Shulman Mikhail Shulman, a Moscow activist, in the city’s Metro. He was arrested in the subway system Jan. 31 through facial recognition, which is being increasingly used to track protesters to their homes and arrest them.

Authorities have begun to crack down on the probiv market, arresting a police officer for trading in data and investigating another.

Anna Kuznetsova, of Roskomsvoboda, saw several ads for facial recognition data on Telegram last year and paid $200 for access to data from 79 Moscow cameras, providing information on her daily routine, work and home addresses and her routes.

Journalist Andrei Kaganskih, of MBKh Media, bought five days’ access to data about himself from a number of cameras and an 80-page report tracking his face over one month. He reported that 30,000 rubles (about $400) could buy sweeping live access to all system cameras.

But the cameras are not pointed at everyone.

Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation analyzed an online Moscow city map of facial recognition cameras on buildings and found none on blocks where senior officials lived. The U.S. State Department sanctioned Russian officials and organizations last month over Russia’s near-fatal poisoning of Navalny last August.

The poisoning exposed how the state security services constantly surveil journalists and opposition figures — but switch off CCTV cameras when moving in for the attack.

Konstantin Kudryavtsev, a member of a clandestine biological and chemical weapons unit in Russia’s FSB security agency, confirmed the poisoning in a December phone call to Navalny, who posed as a senior security aide. When Navalny asked whether there was any chance someone on the poisoning team could have been caught on video, Kudryavtsev told him surveillance cameras were switched off in such operations.

He said: “Now cameras are everywhere, but even so when there are cameras we turn them off, you understand, right?” He added that “we always cut off any possibility of being captured. Maximum conspiracy — this is of utmost importance. No one should be seen.”

In another case, the Britain-based investigative online media outlet Bellingcat used flight and phone records from Russia’s data black market to find that Kudryavtsev and two members of the same FSB unit were in southern Russia around the time of the suspicious death of Timur Kuashev, a 26-year-old journalist and anti-torture activist in Nalchik in July 2014. Bellingcat published a letter from local traffic police to investigators stating that all the video cameras near the theater malfunctioned that night.

Kuashev’s body, with bruises on his face and the marks of an injection in his armpit, was found on a road to a forest nine miles from his home. The death was ruled to be heart failure.

The Internet Protection Society reported “a worrying new trend” after public access to real-time CCTV footage was switched off in six major Russian cities during the January protests. Klimarev said it seemed police wanted to prevent oversight of their actions to control the protests.

Human rights lawyer Kirill Koroteyev said there were no effective checks on how law enforcement used facial recognition and surveillance cameras.

“The system,” he said, “is designed so that there is no way to question how the system operates.”

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. humanitarian chief warned Thursday that the grave humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia’s embattled Tigray region is deteriorating, with no sign of Eritrean troops withdrawing and alarmingly widespread reports of systematic rape and other sexual violence mainly by men in uniform.

Mark Lowcock told a closed Security Council meeting that the U.N. knows that 4.5 million of Tigray’s nearly 6 million people need humanitarian aid and the government estimates 91% of the population needs emergency food.

He said his office received the first report earlier this week of four displaced people dying from hunger, and Thursday morning he received reports of 150 people in the Ofla district just south of Tigray’s capital Mekelle dying from hunger.

“This should alarm us all,” Lowcock said in his briefing, obtained by The Associated Press. “It is a sign of what lies ahead if more action is not taken. Starvation as a weapon of war is a violation.”

No one knows how many thousands of civilians or combatants have been killed since months of political tensions between Ethiopian President Abiy Ahmed’s government and the Tigray leaders who once dominated Ethiopia’s government exploded in November into war. Eritrea, a longtime Tigray enemy, teamed up with neighboring Ethiopia in the conflict.

Lowcock said humanitarian organizations had hoped things would improve after Abiy announced in late March that Eritrean troops would leave Tigray, but he said neither the U.N. nor the aid groups it works with have seen any proof of withdrawal.

“We have, however, heard some reports of Eritrean soldiers now wearing Ethiopian Defense Force uniforms,” he said. “And regardless of uniform or insignia, humanitarian staff continue to report new atrocities which they say are being committed by Eritrean Defense Forces.”

As an example, Lowcock cited an Amnesty International report that Eritrean troops killed three people and wounded 19 Monday “in an unprovoked, indiscriminate shooting attack on civilians in Adwa town.”

There are also reports of militias from neighboring Amhara attacking civilians in western Tigray and driving them from their home while Amhara authorities restrict access to those who fled, he said.

As for reports of sexual violence, Lowcock said one unnamed agency reported that 30% of all incidents against civilians involved some sort of sexual violence and nearly 25% of reports received by another involved gang rape, “with multiple men assaulting the victim,” sometimes repeatedly over a period of days, and with girls as young as 8 years old being targeted.

“Cases reported have involved Ethiopian National Defense Forces, Eritrean Defense Forces, Amhara Special Forces and other irregular armed groups or aligned militia,” he said.

Lowcock said he is left to conclude “that there is no doubt that sexual violence is being used in this conflict as a weapon of war, as a means to humiliate, terrorize and traumatize an entire population today and into the next generation.”

He said humanitarian needs are still growing because “since the conflict began, civilians have endured indiscriminate shelling of towns, targeted violence, mass killings and executions and systematic sexual violence as a weapon of war.”

“Improvements in access and a reduction in conflict and atrocities have often proved temporary and sporadic,” Lowcock said. “So they are getting hungrier and sicker.”

“To be very clear: The conflict is not over and things are not improving,” he said.

Without a cease-fire, Lowcock said, the humanitarian crisis “is only going to get a lot worse.”

Despite these difficulties, humanitarian organizations have reached more than 1.7 million people with some form of aid, but he said more funding is needed.

Lowcock said agencies have allocated about $280 million of what the U.N. thinks will be more than $400 million needed to respond to Tigray’s humanitarian crisis, and he thanked the United States for announcing about $300 million for the region.

For instance, I just found out that he is a father and husband—family is very important to me. Hopefully, his campaign plans to spend some money on television advertisements so I can hear about his vision for America in the coming days and months. Or maybe the newspaper will print some articles that get into his policy proposals. That would definitely help me get to know him better so that I can make an informed decision come November.

BHANNINE, Lebanon (AP) — It was messy and hectic in Aisha al-Abed’s kitchen, as the first day of Ramadan often is. Food had to be on the table at precisely 7:07 p.m. when the sun sets and the daylong fast ends.

What is traditionally a jovial celebration of the start of the Muslim holy month around a hearty meal was muted and dispirited for her small Syrian refugee family.

As the 21-year-old mother of two worked, with her toddler daughter in tow, reminders of life’s hardships were everywhere: In the makeshift kitchen, where she crouched on the ground to chop cucumbers next to a single-burner gas stove. In their home: a tent with a concrete floor and wooden walls covered in a tarp. And, definitely, in their iftar meal -- rice, lentil soup, french fries and a yogurt-cucumber dip; her sister sent over a little chicken and fish.

“This is going to be a very difficult Ramadan,” al-Abed said. “This should be a better meal ... After a day’s fast, one needs more nutrition for the body. Of course, I feel defeated.”

Ramadan, which began Tuesday, comes as Syrian refugees’ life of displacement has gotten even harder amid their host country Lebanon’s economic woes. The struggle can be more pronounced during the holy month, when fasting is typically followed by festive feasting to fill empty stomachs.

“High prices are killing people,” said Raed Mattar, al-Abed’s 24-year-old husband. “We may fast all day and then break our fast on only an onion,” he said, using an Arabic proverb usually meant to convey disappointment after long patience.

Lebanon, home to more than 1 million Syrian refugees, is reeling from an economic crisis exacerbated by the pandemic and a massive explosion that destroyed parts of the capital last August.

Citing the impact of the compounded crises, a U.N. study said the proportion of Syrian refugee families living under the extreme poverty line — the equivalent of roughly $25 a month per person by current black market rates — swelled to 89% in 2020, compared to 55% the previous year.

More people resorted to reducing the size or number of meals, it said. Half the Syrian refugee families surveyed suffer from food insecurity, up from 28% at the same time in 2019, it said.

Refugees are not alone in their pain. The economic turmoil, which is the culmination of years of corruption and mismanagement, has squeezed the Lebanese, plunging 55% of the country’s 5 million people into poverty and shuttering businesses.

As jobs became scarce, Mattar said more Lebanese competed for the low-paying construction and plumbing jobs previously left largely for foreign workers like himself. Wages lost their value as the local currency, fixed to the dollar for decades, collapsed. Mattar went from making the equivalent of more than $13 a day to less than $2, roughly the price of a kilo and a half (about 3 pounds) of non-subsidized sugar.

“People are kind and are helping, but the situation has become disastrous,” he said. “The Lebanese themselves can’t live. Imagine how we are managing.”

Nerves are fraying. Mattar was among hundreds displaced from an informal camp last year after a group of Lebanese set it on fire following a fight between a Syrian and a Lebanese.

It was the fifth displacement for al-Abed’s young family, bouncing mainly between informal settlements in northern Lebanon. They had to move twice after that, once when a Lebanese landowner doubled the rent, telling Mattar he can afford it since he gets aid as a refugee. Their current tent is in Bhannine.

This year, Syrians marked the 10th anniversary of the start of the uprising-turned-civil war in their country. Many refugees say they cannot return because their homes were destroyed or they fear retribution, either for being considered opposition or for evading military conscription, like Mattar. He and al-Abed each fled Syria in 2011 and met in Lebanon.

Even before Ramadan started, Rahaf al-Saghir, another Syrian in Lebanon, fretted over what her family’s iftar would look like.

“I don’t know what to do,” said the recently widowed mother of three daughters. “The girls keep saying they crave meat, they crave chicken, biscuits and fruit.”

As the family’s options dwindled, her daughters’ questions became more heart wrenching. Why can’t we have chips like the neighbors’ kids? Why don’t we drink milk to grow up like they say on television? Al-Saghir recalled breaking into tears when her youngest asked her what the strawberry she was seeing on television tasted like. She later bought her some, using U.N. assistance money, she said.

For Ramadan, al-Saghir was determined to stop her daughters from seeing photos of other people’s iftar meals. “I don’t want them to compare themselves to others,” she said. “When you are fasting in Ramadan, you crave a lot of things.”

The start of Ramadan, the first since al-Saghir’s husband died, brought tears. Her oldest daughters were used to their father waking them for suhoor, the pre-dawn meal before the day’s fast, which he’d prepare.

A few months before he died — of cardiac arrest — the family moved into a one-bedroom apartment shared with a relative’s family.

This year, their first iftar was simple — french fries, soup and fattoush salad. Al-Saghir wanted chicken but decided it was too expensive.

Before violence uprooted them from Syria, Ramadan felt festive. Al-Saghir would cook and exchange visits with family and neighbors, gathering around scrumptious savory and sweet dishes.

“Now, there’s no family, no neighbors and no sweets,” she said. “Ramadan feels like any other day. We may even feel more sorrow.”

Amid her struggles, she turns to her faith.

“I keep praying to God,” she said. “May our prayers in Ramadan be answered and may our situation change. ... May a new path open for us.”

Saturday is the first day of the traditional New Year in Myanmar and the last day of a five-day holiday that is usually celebrated with visits to Buddhist temples and rowdy water throwing and partying in the streets.

Pro-democracy activists called for the cancellation of the festivities this year and instead for people to focus on a campaign to restore democracy after the military's ouster of the elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.

Suu Kyi is among 3,141 people arrested in connection with the coup, according to a tally by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) activist group.

""These detainees are mostly from before Feb. 1 but there are also some who were imprisoned after,"" Prisons Department spokesman Kyaw Tun Oo told Reuters by telephone.

Asked if any of those being freed might have been detained in connection with the protests against military rule, he said he did not have details of the amnesties.

While the military was freeing the thousands of prisoners, it was also seeking 832 people on warrants in connection with the protests, the AAPP said.

Among them are 200 people, including several internet celebrities, actors and singers who have spoken out against the coup, wanted on a charge of encouraging dissent in the armed forces, which can carry a three-year jail term.

Two of them, the married couple of film director Christina Kyi and actor Zenn Kyi, were detained at the airport in the main city of Yangon on Saturday as they were trying to leave on a flight to Bangkok, the Irrawaddy news site reported.

A spokesman for the junta did not answer calls seeking comment.

ROUGH ROAD

Myanmar has been in upheaval since the coup, which the military defended with accusations of fraud in a November election won by Suu Kyi's party, though the election commission dismissed the objections.

The ousted government had held power for the first five years of civilian rule since nearly half a century of army control ended.

People infuriated by the return of military rule have taken to the streets day after day to demand the restoration of democracy, defying crackdowns by the security forces in which 728 people have been killed, according to the AAPP's latest figures.

Political leaders, including ousted members of parliament, announced the formation of a National Unity Government (NUG) on Friday including Suu Kyi and leaders of the anti-coup protests and ethnic minorities.

The NUG says it is the legitimate political authority and has called for international recognition.

The junta has yet to comment on the unity government but has said it will hold a new election within two years and hand power to the winner.

The NUG's vice president, Duwal Sheila, an ethnic Kachin lawyer, said in a New Year message the road to replacing military rule with democracy would be rough.

""We pledge to continue working with all ethnic peoples to overthrow the military dictatorship and establish a new federal democracy,"" he said.

Protesters took to the streets in the second city of Mandalay in support of the NUG, media reported.

The coup has also triggered clashes between the army and ethnic minority insurgent groups in the north and east.

On Saturday, fighters from the Kachin Independence Army attacked an air base in the north with rockets or shells, one of which hit a nearby village house, injuring one person, the Mizzima news agency reported.

Suu Kyi faces various charges including violating an official secrets act that could see her jailed for 14 years. Her lawyers dismiss the charges.

1,McDonald's Drops 'Hammurderer' Character From Advertising,https://www.theonion.com/mcdonalds-drops-hammurderer-character-from-advertising-1819566355,"OAK BROOK, IL—Bowing to outcry from consumers and parents groups, the McDonald’s Corporation announced Monday that it is discontinuing its new advertising mascot, “The Hammurderer,” a mischievous, homicidal imp who kills McDonaldland characters and takes their sandwiches.

The discontinued character.

Developed by Chicago advertising agency DDB Needham, the Hammurderer made his debut two months ago and has since appeared in a series of Saturday-morning television commercials, as well as on Happy Meal bags and activity placemats. All appearances by and references to the violent, ill-tempered prison escapee will be dropped.

“Over the years, McDonald’s has successfully introduced a number of new characters whose defining characteristic is a certain measure of comical, criminal intent,” said Andrew Perlich, McDonald’s vice-president of promotions. “Such shady characters as The Hamburglar, The Goblins, and the bloodthirsty pirate Captain Crook have all fit nicely into the McDonald’s advertising universe. We had every reason to believe that the Hammurderer, with his long rap sheet of burger-related crimes and his signature cry of ‘Stabble Stabble Stabble,’ would take his place in this proud lineage of McDonaldland mischief-makers.”

The Hammurderer’s Jan. 11 debut ad—in which he seizes and devours the McDonald’s Happy Meal Guys, oblivious to their frantic screams—earned poor marks from parents and child-development experts, who feared the spot might send the message to children that killing is acceptable. Several weeks later, more controversy erupted over the promotional coloring book “Shivved In The McRibs,” in which the Hammurderer decapitates Mayor McCheese and eats his head. Responding to widespread public outrage, McDonald’s executives defended the coloring book as “not nearly as violent or socially irresponsible as it has been made out to be, given that the Mayor’s head is, in fact, a giant and conceivably edible cheeseburger.”

But the uproar over the latest commercial, in which Birdie The Early Bird is garroted by the Hammurderer and her body tossed in a Dumpster, was vociferous enough to prompt the fast-food giant to pull the plug.

“We are sensitive to the concerns of parents and will immediately begin phasing out this character,” Perlich said. “Whether we will remove him from commercials without explanation or write him out of the spots with a bloody police standoff, we have yet to decide. But we’re confident the Hammurderer will be off the national radar by April.”

Hammurderer toys and promotional items, which include dolls, T-shirts, ski masks, and spiked bats, have been recalled and are expected to become prized collectibles.

This is not the first time a McDonald’s character has stirred controversy for its violent nature. In 1982, the company introduced “Shakes McJunkie,” an emaciated addict who robbed characters of their possessions, which he then sold to buy McDonald’s shakes. He was later reworked as “The Machead,” a homeless, wild-eyed Big Mac addict who turned to panhandling and gay prostitution as a means of supporting his severe burger habit.

The Hammurderer is quickly becoming regarded as the worst-received advertising mascot since Kool-Aid’s 1989 discontinuation of “The Grapist,” a huge purple monster who sodomizes thirsty children.",503,3343,6,57

April 15 (UPI) -- India reported 200,000 new COVID-19 cases and more than 1,000 deaths Thursday amid a second surge in the virus.

The nation has reported more than 1.9 million new cases and 10,600 deaths since the beginning of this month, including 652,000 infections between April 1 and April 7, according to tallies by CNBC.

Thursday's increase was the highest daily number of new cases since the start of the pandemic and more than double the previous record in 2020.

Earlier this week, India surpassed Brazil in total infections since the start of the pandemic with 14.07 million cases, trailing only the United States, which has 31.48 million, according to data gathered by Johns Hopkins University.

There is no national stay-at-home order in India, but the western state of Maharashtra, which is home to India's financial capital Mumbai, instituted a lockdown on Wednesday that will last through May 1.

The state's chief minister ordered that only essential services such as public transport and grocery stores will be operational between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m., and people will not be permitted in public spaces without a valid reason.

Epidemiologist Giridhara Babu of the Public Health Foundation of India told NPR that newer variants of the virus are likely the cause for the surge in cases, adding that many of those infected in this second wave are asymptomatic.

""But when the surge occurs, even 5% to 10% will be a large number requiring hospitalizations,"" Babu said.

The surge in cases has placed a strain on India's hospital system, with a line of more than 100 ambulances seen waiting to transfer patients to a hospital in the city of Ahmedabad.

India's health ministry showed it has administered more than 110 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines since it began its inoculation push in January.

Israelis went about barefaced on Sunday after the order to wear masks outdoors was rescinded in another step towards relative normality thanks to the country’s mass-vaccination against COVID-19.

With about 81% of citizens or residents over 16 - the age group eligible for the Pfizer/BioNTech (PFE.N), (22UAy.DE) vaccine in Israel - having received both doses, contagions and hospitalisations are down sharply.

But entry by foreigners is still limited and non-immune Israelis who return from abroad must self-isolate, due to concern virus variants could challenge the vaccine. read more The Health Ministry said it had detected seven cases of a new Indian variant in Israel, whose potency was being assessed.

""We are leading the world right now when it comes to emerging from the coronavirus,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters. ""(But) we have still not finished with the coronavirus. It can return.""

The police-enforced wearing of protective masks outdoors, ordered a year ago for non-exercise activities, was scrapped. But the Health Ministry said the requirement still applied for indoor public spaces and urged citizens to keep masks to hand.

""Breathing Freely,"" read the cover headline of the mass-circulation daily Israel Hayom.

Teachers were instructed to continue ventilating classrooms and to maintain social distancing in lessons and breaks. Extra-curricular activities such as children's theatres remain off-limits.

Syrians abroad will be “able to vote at embassies” on May 20, Hamouda Sabbagh said in a statement, adding that prospective candidates could hand in their applications from Monday.

Assad, who took power following the death of his father Hafez in 2000, has not yet officially announced that he will stand for re-election.

He won a previous election three years into Syria’s devastating civil war in 2014, with 88 percent of the vote.

Under Syria’s 2012 constitution, a president may only serve two seven-year terms — except for the president elected in the 2014 poll.

Candidates must have lived continuously in Syria for at least 10 years, meaning that opposition figures in exile are barred from standing.

Candidates must also have the backing of at least 35 members of the parliament, which is dominated by Assad’s Baath party.

The Czech officials were given just a day to leave in a harsher than tit-for-tat response to a decision by the Czech government a day earlier to kick 18 Russian diplomats out of their country within 72 hours.

Prague imposed the punishment after accusing Moscow's intelligence services of the attack on the Vrbetice facility in October 2014, which left two workers dead.

The Kremlin has denied involvement in the blast - calling the allegation unfounded, far-fetched and absurd.

The hostilities are the gravest between Prague and Moscow since the end of decades of Soviet domination of eastern Europe in 1989.

They come as a recent build-up of Russian forces on Russia's border with Ukraine ratchet up tensions between Moscow and the West.

Tom Tugendhat, chair of the foreign affairs select committee, told Sky News the 2014 explosion in the Czech Republic was a ""war-like act"" and a ""direct attack on a NATO country"".

""I think we need to be dealing with Russia in the way that it deals with the rest of the world - which is harshly,"" he said, suggesting expelling ambassadors as well as diplomats.

The UK fully supports the Czech Republic, Dominic Raab said.

The UK stands in full support of our Czech allies, who have exposed the lengths that the GRU will go to in their attempts to conduct dangerous and malign operations – and highlights a disturbing pattern of behaviour following the attack in Salisbury. https://t.co/dv4rWDl91I — Dominic Raab (@DominicRaab) April 18, 2021

The foreign secretary said the Czech authorities ""have exposed the lengths that the Russian intelligence services will go to in their attempts to conduct dangerous and malign operations in Europe"".

He added: ""Russia must desist from these actions, which violate the most basic international norms.""

Czech police said they are hunting two alleged Russian military intelligence officers in connection with the 16 October 2014 blast.

The suspects are believed to have travelled into the Czech Republic on passports with the aliases Ruslan Boshirov and Alexander Petrov.

The UK said they are the same GRU officers - whose true identities are thought to be Anatoly Chepiga and Alexander Mishkin - accused of trying to kill former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia with a novichok nerve agent. That attack took place in the Wiltshire city of Salisbury three-and-a-half years later, in March 2018.

Russia has always denied involvement in the spy poisonings.

Image: Sergei and Yulia Skripal were attacked with a nerve agent in 2018

Chepiga and Mishkin even appeared on Russian television, using their aliases, to claim they were sports nutritionists, not spies, who happened to be in Salisbury as tourists on the day of the poisonings as they wanted to see its world-famous cathedral, in particular the spire.

But western security officials believe the pair are part of a GRU Russian military intelligence unit called 29155 that has been linked to a series of other attacks.

This includes a failed coup in Montenegro in 2016, the poisoning of a Bulgarian arms dealer called Emilian Gebrev in Bulgaria in 2015 and possible bounty payments to Afghan militants for killing NATO troops.

Christo Grozev, lead Russia investigator at the investigative website Bellingcat, said an order of weapons that was due to be sent from the Czech arms depot to Mr Gebrev in Bulgaria could have been the reason why the site was hit.

""On exactly the date that the explosion took place, there was a transaction closing, the loading of weapons or munition to Bulgaria being acquired by Gebrev. It seems that that particular transaction or inventory was being targeted,"" he said in an interview.

It is not clear who the planned end-customer was for the weapons or why that had allegedly attracted the displeasure of Russia. One theory is that they could have been bound for Ukraine, which at the time was locked in conflict with Russia, or headed for a NATO member state.

Mr Grozev said that the discovery of an email chain in recent months had alerted the Czech authorities to the link between the Skripal suspects and the arms depot.

The two men had allegedly travelled into the Czech Republic on 11 October under their Boshirov and Petrov fake identities.

They then adopted other fake personas in communication with the arms depot, with one pretending to be Nicolai Popa travelling on a Moldovan passport, and the other using a Tajik passport in the name of Ruslan Tabarov. They pretended to be representing the national guard of Tajikistan.

""These emails containing scans of their fake passports… were just discovered about three months ago by the Czech authorities who started looking into the reason for the Skripal poisoners to be in the Czech Republic,"" Mr Grozev said.

Bellingcat already had data showing that the two men had been in the country at that time. They just did not know for sure why.

Czech police have revealed that they arrived in Prague on 11 October before travelling to the region where the arms depot is located.

They left the Czech Republic on 16 October, the same day as the attack.

Six months after the depot bombing, Mr Gebrev, the arms dealer, was admitted into hospital after collapsing in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia. His son and one of this company's executives also fell sick.

Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said there was ""well-grounded suspicion"" about the involvement of officers of the Russian intelligence service GRU in the ammunitions depot explosion.

A diplomatic source cited by Russian news agency Interfax suggested the expulsions could prompt Russia to shut the Czech Republic's embassy in Moscow.

The steps highlight rising fears of an implosion of the Lebanese state, in which authorities can no longer import food or fuel to keep the lights on. They underline Hezbollah 's growing role in tackling the emergency with services that the government would otherwise provide.

The plan chimes with worries in Lebanon that people will have to rely on political factions for food and security, in the way many did in the militia days of the 1975-1990 civil war.

In response to a question about Hezbollah's plans, Leila Hatoum, an adviser to the caretaker prime minister, said the country was ""in no condition to refuse aid"" regardless of politics.

The sources from the pro-Hezbollah camp, who declined to be named, said the plan for a potential worst-case scenario has gathered pace as an end to subsidies looms in the coming months, raising the specter of hunger and unrest.

Lebanon's currency has crashed as the country runs out of dollars, with no state rescue in sight. Food prices have shot up 400%.

Fights in supermarkets are now commonplace, as are people rummaging through trash. A brawl over food packages this week killed one person and injured two others.

Hezbollah's plan would help shield its communities - not only members but also mainly Shi'ite residents of districts it dominates - from the worst of the crisis, the sources said. It could also contain any restlessness among core supporters, analysts say.

Hezbollah, which with its allies has a majority in parliament and government, did not respond to a request for comment.

""The preparations have begun for the next stage...It is indeed an economic battle plan,"" said one of the sources, a senior official.

OUTSIZED NETWORK

Already, the new ration card, seen by Reuters, helps hundreds of people buy basic goods in the local currency - largely Iranian, Lebanese and Syrian cheaper items at a discount up to 40%, subsidized by the party, the sources said.

The card - named after a Shi'ite Imam - can be used at co-ops, some of them newly opened, in the southern Beirut suburbs and parts of southern Lebanon where Hezbollah holds sway. The sources did not elaborate on the budget or recipients.

An Iran-funded paramilitary force which critics once called ""a state within a state,"" Hezbollah has grown more entangled in Lebanese state affairs in recent years.

Washington, which deems Hezbollah a terrorist group, has ramped up sanctions to choke off its sources of funding, including what it estimates as hundreds of millions of dollars from Tehran every year.

Iranian funding keeps Hezbollah better off than many in the country's mosaic of parties, including those opposed to its arsenal. Some factions have issued aid baskets to their patronage communities, but the Iran-backed network remains outsized in comparison.

""They're all doing it...But Hezbollah's scope is much bigger and more powerful, with more resources to deal with the crisis,"" said Joseph Daher, a researcher who wrote a book on Hezbollah's political economy. ""This is more about limiting the catastrophe for its popular base. It means the dependency on Hezbollah particularly will increase.""

And while Hezbollah gives ration cards, the state, hollowed out by decades of graft and debt, has talked up the idea of such a card for poor Lebanese for nearly a year without acting.

Ministers have said the need for parliamentary approval has stalled the cabinet's plan for cards.

DARKNESS AND HUNGER

Photos on social media of shelves stacked with canned goods, reportedly from one of Hezbollah's co-ops, spread across Lebanon last week.

Fatima Hamoud, in her 50s, said the ration card allows her once a month to buy grains, oil and cleaning products for a household of eight. ""They know we're in bad shape,"" she said. ""Without them, what would we have done in these tough times.""

A second Shi'ite source said Hezbollah had filled up warehouses and launched the cards to extend services outside the party and plug gaps in the Lebanese market, where cheap alternatives are more common than pre-crisis.

He said the card offers a quota, based on the family size, for needs like sugar and flour.

The goods are backed by Hezbollah, imported by allied companies or brought in without customs fees through the border with Syria, where Hezbollah forces have a footing since joining the war to back Damascus alongside Iran.

The source added that Hezbollah had similar plans for medicine imports. Some pharmacists in the southern suburbs of Beirut said they had received training on new Iranian and Syrian brands that popped up on the shelves in recent months.

Two of the sources said the plan included stockpiling fuel from Iran, as Lebanon's energy ministry warns of a possible total blackout. The senior official said Hezbollah was clearing storage space for fuel in next-door Syria.",847,5363,12,70
0,Iran nuclear talks to continue amid ‘new understanding’,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/17/iran-nuclear-talks-to-continue-amid-signs-of-progress,"Iran’s top negotiator says ‘new understanding’ emerging after round of talks in Vienna to restore 2015 nuclear deal.

Tehran, Iran – Another round of talks in Vienna to restore Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers has concluded on a hopeful note as different sides said progress is being made.

The Joint Commission of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) convened on Saturday in the Austrian capital with top negotiators from Iran, China, Russia, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom.

Representatives from the United States, which left the accord in 2018 and unilaterally imposed sanctions on Iran, were again in a different hotel with Europeans shuttling back and forth between them and other representatives.

After the talks, Iran’s top negotiator said a “new understanding” appears to be forming between all sides as the results of the job done by two working groups – one to determine what sanctions the US needs to lift, and one to determine what nuclear measures Iran needs to take – were reviewed.

“There is now a shared view of the end goal between all sides and the path that needs to be taken is a bit better known,” said Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s deputy foreign minister and a veteran negotiator.

“Although it won’t be an easy path. There are some serious differences that will need to be resolved,” he added.

Araghchi said the talks have now reached a stage where all sides can work on a joint text. He said Iran has drafted a text, both on sanction-lifting and on nuclear measures, that will act as the basis for a final agreement.

Enrique Mora, the European Union’s deputy foreign policy chief, said in a tweet following the Joint Commission meeting that “progress has been made” in what is a difficult task and more work is needed, but “everyone is committed to the same objective” of the US rejoining the deal.

Key that everyone is committed to the same objectives: US rejoining the #JCPOA and its full implementation. pic.twitter.com/84CDnzC4nf — Enrique Mora (@enriquemora_) April 17, 2021

Russian representative Mikhail Ulyanov also tweeted that progress has been made, and that participants had “expressed determination to continue negotiations with a view to complete the process successfully as soon as possible”.

According to Ulyanov, the expert working groups will continue their work through next week, after which the Joint Commission may reconvene if necessary.

The latest round of talks, which began on Thursday, continued even as Araghchi announced on Wednesday that Iran will soon commence enriching uranium to a purity of 60 percent.

The announcement came days after Iran’s main nuclear facilities at Natanz were targeted in an attack – which Tehran alleges was orchestrated by Israel – that led to a large blackout and damaged an unknown number of centrifuges.

Iran had previously boosted its uranium enrichment to 20 percent following the assassination of a top nuclear and military scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, in November. The JCPOA caps the country’s enrichment at 3.67 percent. Enrichment of 90 percent is required for weapons-grade use.

Iran’s state television on Saturday aired footage from inside the Natanz complex, where centrifuges were shown to be enriching uranium.

Iran’s nuclear chief Ali Akbar Salehi said the country began production of 60 percent enriched uranium on Friday. Iran has said it wants to use it to produce molybdenum to ultimately manufacture radiopharmaceuticals.

Iranian state television also reported that a 43-year-old man named Reza Karimi was responsible for the Natanz attack but has since left the country. The report also aired what appeared to be an Interpol red notice seeking his arrest.",670,4143,8,55

0,Israeli spies impersonated journalists to gather info from Emirati dissidents: Report,https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2021/04/17/649661/Israel-spies-Bluehawk-UAE-,"A private Israeli spy company has reportedly impersonated journalists in order to elicit information from opponents of the leadership of Ras Al Khaimah, one of the seven emirates of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

The Daily Beast reported last week that individuals pretending to be a Fox News researcher and a reporter for Italy’s La Stampa newspaper approached two men, who have fallen afoul of the Ras Al Khaimah regime, in early 2020.

The journalist impersonators, it added, tried to trick the two men into divulging information about their legal disputes with the Emirati authorities.

Facebook revealed that the accounts used by the two supposed journalists were associated with the private Israeli intelligence firm Bluehawk CI.

In one of the cases, a woman claiming to be named “Samantha,” a FOX News journalist, contacted Oussama el-Omari by email, trying to obtain information about his legal rifts with the Ras Al Khaimah regime.

Omari, former chief executive and director general of the Ras Al Khaimah Free Trade Zone Authority, was convicted in absentia in the UAE for “embezzlement and abuse of position” following a succession battle in the emirate.

Similarly, another Facebook user pretending to be a La Stampa reporter contacted Khater Massaad, another foe of the current Ras Al Khaimah leadership.

Massaad was convicted by an Emirati court in 2015 of embezzlement from Ras Al Khaimah’s sovereign wealth fund, RAKIA.

Both Omari and Massaad say the charges against them are politically motivated.

Meanwhile, a Times of Israel investigation found that Guy Klisman, a former major in the Israel Army who owns Bluehawk CI, has a history of prior fraud prosecutions in the occupied territories.

Established in June 2018, the company claims on its website that it offers cyber technologies and intelligence solutions, including “social engineering & PR campaign management” and “complex intelligence investigations.”

Last year’s normalization of ties between Israel and the UAE paved the way for lucrative deals by Israeli intelligence and cybersecurity firms in the Persian Gulf country.

Some experts worry they could be worse

With Covid-19 vaccines, the world hopes to beat back the virus that causes the disease. But some scientists are increasingly concerned that, because of a quirk of our own biology, future iterations of the vaccines might not always be quite as effective as they are today.

The concerns stem from a phenomenon that is known as imprinting, sometimes called original antigenic sin, which is believed to affect how we respond to some pathogens.

In short, when your body is introduced to a particular threat for the first time — either through infection or a vaccine — that encounter sets your immune system’s definition of that virus and what immune weapons it needs to detect and protect against it in the future.

That imprint can be helpful. In the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, elderly adults were protected by immune responses they’d generated more than half a century earlier, in childhood, through encounters with a related virus. But it can also interfere with your body’s ability to mount responses against strains that have evolved from the one you were first exposed to.

In the case of Covid, some scientists are concerned that the immune system’s reaction to the vaccines being deployed now could leave an indelible imprint, and that next-generation products, updated in response to emerging variants of the SARS-CoV-2, won’t confer as much protection.

Michael Worobey, who was been involved in groundbreaking research on imprinting with influenza, said he worries the responses to first-generation Covid-19 vaccines will prove to be “a high-water mark” for people’s immune responses to these inoculations.

“I do think it’s something that we need to be thinking about,” Worobey, a professor of evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona, told STAT. “We might actually see lower efficacy five years from now, if people are still locked into recalling the response to the first [SARS-2] antigen that they saw.”

Sarah Cobey, an associate professor of computational biology at the University of Chicago, shares his worry. “As long as we have competition between old antibody responses and new antibody responses … then it seems like exactly the right sort of environment to see these phenomena,” Cobey said.

“I can’t think of a reason that should be restricted to influenza,” she added.

Not everyone in the conversation is convinced there will be a problem, though.

Vineet Menachery is a coronavirus expert at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, one of the smallish community of researchers who were studying coronaviruses before the Covid-19 pandemic hit. He noted that the SARS-2 spike protein — the protein that projects from the virus’ surface, giving it the appearance of wearing a crown — doesn’t have as much wiggle room to change as the hemagglutinin proteins that sit atop of flu viruses.

Both the spike and the hemagglutinin proteins are the means by which their respective viruses attach to the cells they are trying to infect; in the case of SARS-2 viruses, attachment occurs via a receptor known as ACE2. But influenza viruses mutate at a far faster rate than coronaviruses and they have much more leeway to change — mutational space, Menachery called it — without impeding its functionality.

“The changes that we see in the [SARS-2] variants aren’t whole-hog changes,” he said.

Imprinting is one of the reasons why flu vaccines aren’t as protective as we’d like them to be. Flu is a notorious shape-shifter and its constant alterations allow influenza viruses to evade immune system protections generated by either vaccination or previous infections. People who first encountered H1N1 viruses, for instance, never get as much protection from the H3N2 component of a flu shot as they do from the H1N1 part.

“Basically, I think of original antigenic sin as some sort of hierarchy in immune memory, meaning you preferentially boost what you’ve seen before, at the expense of developing responses to the new stuff,” Cobey said. “It could impact the effectiveness of [Covid] vaccine going forward.”

Scott Hensley, a sometimes collaborator of Cobey’s, has actually seen some evidence of coronavirus imprinting in his research. An associate professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania, Hensley and colleagues were working to develop Covid-19 antibody tests in the early days of the pandemic. The work involved studying using blood samples from people who contracted Covid. They compared the post-infection samples to blood drawn from the same individuals prior to the pandemic.

In comparing the before and after blood samples, they saw in the post-infection sample a “dramatic” rise in antibodies to one of the humans coronaviruses that is among the causes of the common cold. It was a virus called OC43, which is in the same coronavirus family as SARS-2, as well as the viruses that cause SARS and MERS.

In other words, Covid infection actually boosted the immune system’s protection against a different virus, one that the immune system already knew.

Still, Hensley isn’t worried about imprinting — or at least not among people who have been vaccinated with mRNA vaccines. The very strong immune response generated by the Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines should override any imprinting impacts as SARS-2 mutates, he said. Hensley worries, though, that people whose immunity to the virus comes from infection, not vaccination, might have more difficulty handling variant viruses because of imprinting effects.

David Topham, an immunologist at the University of Rochester Medical Center and director of the New York Influenza Center of Excellence, also envisages that possibility.

He noted that, in the earliest stages of SARS-2 infection, the immune system mounts a response to a portion of the spike protein called S2. Later, the immune system focuses its attention on other parts of the spike, notably the part of the protein that attaches the virus to cells it invades, known as the receptor binding domain.

It’s not yet known if the early focus on S2 — which doesn’t change much from virus to virus — will blind the immune system to the changes elsewhere in the spike protein, the changes updated vaccines would be trying to teach the immune system to respond to, Topham said.

Topham doesn’t think this will be a problem in vaccinated people, because of the way the vaccines in use have been designed. The spike proteins they trigger production of appear to hide the S2 region, he said. The immune system can’t fixate on something it doesn’t see.

For people whose immunity comes from infection, Topham sees three possible scenarios. “It can be a problem, because the immune cells specific for S2 outcompete immune cells against other components of the spike protein that you really need in order to get protection. It can be inconsequential in that eventually the responses to the other parts of the protein catch up and it doesn’t matter. Or it could actually be a benefit because it gets the immune system revved up more quickly.”

Topham is not alone in speculating that an original Covid vaccine with a booster targeting variant viruses could, in fact, lead to a stronger immune response.

“You might actually end up with an immune response that is broader,” said Florian Krammer, a professor of vaccinology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.

Krammer used as an example research done by scientists at the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare and University of Turku on vaccination against H5N1 bird flu. H5N1 vaccine that don’t contain adjuvants — boosting compounds — appear to generate poor immune responses. But in a paper published in the journal Vaccine, the researchers reported that a priming and boosting regimen that used two different H5N1 vaccines, made with different strains of the virus, induced a strong and long-lasting response.

We may find out whether this is going to be a problem sooner than you’d think. Moderna is working with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases — which helped it design its original Covid vaccine — to test an updated version of its vaccine that targets the variant first spotted in South Africa, B.1.351. That variant appears to be able to evade immune responses triggered by earlier versions of the virus.

“The Phase 1 studies conducted by Moderna and NIAID … will produce immunogenicity data that will address this question,” John Mascola, director of NIAID’s Vaccine Research Center, told STAT in an email. “So data directly bearing on the question will be forthcoming over the next weeks and months.”",1447,8894,9,61

On the fifth anniversary of declaring B.C.’s public health emergency for overdose deaths, B.C. will officially request a federal exemption from Health Canada to decriminalize personal possession of drugs.

Since April 14, 2016, the BC Coroners Service reports illicit drugs have claimed the lives of at least 7,072 British Columbians.

“Stigma drives people to hide their drug use, avoid health care and use alone,” Mental Health and Addictions Minister Sheila Malcolmson said.

“Through province-wide decriminalization, we can reduce the fear and shame that keep people silent about their drug use, and support people to reach out for help, life-saving supports and treatment.”

Officials with the B.C. Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions and Health Canada have been working on an agreement that outlines how the Province of B.C. will work with Health Canada to apply for a province-wide exemption to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, which governs simple drug possession.

Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, Chief Coroner Lisa Lapointe, Premier John Horgan and police chiefs across B.C. have been calling on the federal government to decriminalize simple possession of illicit drugs.

A new record high was set in 2020, with 1,724 lives lost in B.C. An additional 329 deaths took place in the first two months of 2021.

“Today, we remember and grieve the thousands of people who have lost their lives in B.C. due to a toxic illicit drug supply,” Lapointe said.

“I extend my heartfelt condolences to all of those who have lost a beloved family member or friend as a result of the unscrupulous and profit-driven illicit drug market. The tragic loss of these thousands of individuals underlines the urgent need for a substantial shift in our provincial and national response to problematic substance use.”

Lapointe and Henry have been pushing for access to a safer drug supply. This would also include additional addiction support for those seeking safe supply.

The province has put in temporary measures during the COVID-19 pandemic to allow better access to opioids through prescription. British Columbia has seen a spike in illicit drug deaths during the pandemic due to an increase in people using alone and disruption to the international supply of illicit drugs.

“The opposite of addiction is connection. More than ever before we need to connect with those using drugs with compassion and love. We need to be bold with addressing these complex issues” Henry said.

“We need to put the same resources in dealing with this crisis as we have with the pandemic.”

The province says since 2018, more than 6,000 deaths have been averted because of expanded access to overdose prevention services including wide availability and naloxone.

Currently, more than 23,000 people are receiving some form of opioid agonist treatment in B.C. – more than at any other time.

First Nations communities have been particularly impacted by the overdose crisis. The First Nations Health Authority (FNHA) reports between January and May 2020, 89 First Nations individuals died in B.C. due to illicit drug toxicity – a 93 per cent increase compared to the same period in 2019.

During that period, 16 per cent of all drug toxicity deaths in B.C. were Indigenous people, who account for just 3.3 per cent of the province’s population.

“The data underscores the immense toll that illicit drug toxicity is having on the lives of Indigenous people and their communities in B.C.,” acting FNHA chief medical officer Dr. Shannon McDonald said.

“That the opioid crisis continues to wreak havoc on Indigenous people five years after the B.C. government’s declaration of a public health emergency on opioid use is a clear indication that there is still much more to be done to resolve this tragic public health issue.”",712,4433,11,86

The Office of the National Security Council (ONSC) said that Afghanistan is battling on the frontline of a war against terrorism, and stated that international cooperation to Afghan security forces will continue even after the end of the mission of foreign forces.

Meanwhile, members of ANDSF have said that the Taliban shouldn’t ""miscalculate"" that the withdrawal of foreign forces will help them win the war in Afghanistan.

They said that the all Afghan soldiers serving in the ranks of the ANDSF are ready to defend their country against any hostile move.

A TOLOnews’ reporter on Thursday visited a unit of the Afghan Special Operation Forces in Chahar Asiab district near Kabul where members of the Special Operations Forces reiterated their commitment to defend Afghanistan.

“The Afghan security and defense forces are ready to maintain the security of Afghanistan, we are thankful to the international community,” said Hayatullah Hayat, the acting Minister of Interior.

“We are not less than the neighboring countries, we are ready to serve voluntarily, we will not let anyone cast an evil eye toward our land,” said Sayed Agha Pacha, a member of the Special Operation Forces.

NATO has committed to continue supporting ANDSF until 2024. However it is not clear whether the alliance will continue its cooperation to ANDSF in the wake of President Joe Biden’s decision to withdraw American troops by September.

“We will defend our soil till the lost drop of our blood,” said Shafiullah Hamdard, a member of the Special Operations Forces.

“They have 20 years of war and combat in the battlefields, the majority of them came to get ready for that day when the Americans will leave,” said Shafiullah Hamdard, a commander of the Special Operations Forces.

Currently there are about 300,000 soldiers serving in the ranks of the ANDSF. The expense of these soldiers is estimated at $4 billion annually.

Meanwhile, US Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin said that US troops have accomplished the mission that they were sent to Afghanistan to accomplish.

“And they have much for which to be proud. Their services and their sacrifices, alongside those of our Resolute Support and Afghan partners, make possible the greatly diminished threat to all of our homelands from Al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups,” he said.

US President Joe Biden on Wednesday announced the full withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan, who have stayed in the country for nearly 20 years, an announcement that was accompanied by concerns of plunging the war-ravaged country into a new civil war.

Biden said that it has been 10 years since Osama Bin Laden's death, and it is time to end America's war in the country and to bring US troops home.

“We will begin our withdrawal on May 1,” Biden said, adding that it will not be a “hasty rush to the exit,” and if the Taliban attacks, the US will defend itself and partners with “all the tools at our disposal.”

Announcing a full withdrawal from the country, Biden said, ""We went to Afghanistan because of a horrific attack that happened 20 years ago.""

""That cannot explain why we should remain there in 2021,"" he added.

“Today, the Afghan people police their own streets, they defend their own interest. They elect their own leaders, many of whom are women. They send their children to school. And they own and operate more private enterprises than ever before. There is still too much violence, to be sure. And we know the Taliban still will seek to reverse some of this progress,” said US Defense Secretary Austin.

Russia's media watchdog Roskomnadzor has filed at least 390 violation cases against RFE/RL since October and is expected to announce more on Friday.

The broadcaster is asking the ECHR to order Russia to refrain from enforcing the fines until the court can make a full ruling on Roskomnadzor's moves.

""We are hopeful that the European Court of Human Rights will view these actions by the government of Russia for what they are: an attempt to suppress free speech and the human rights of the Russian people,"" RFE/RL president Jamie Fly said in a statement.

RFE/RL said the fines could reach millions of dollars.

Why is Russia imposing fines on media outlets?

Last year, Roskomnadzor ordered broadcasters and non-governmental organizations that receive foreign funding to add a lengthy disclaimer to their content specifying that it was created by an outlet ""performing the functions of a foreign agent.""

The decision has been widely criticized as a tool to discredit critical reporting, with the term ""foreign agent"" carrying Soviet-era connotations in Russia.

RFE/RL's said Russia’s moves violate the European Convention on Human Rights.

Last week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken raised concerns over Russia's ""efforts to close Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and silence this valued source of independent reporting.""

The standoff comes as Washington's ties with Moscow are strained by several issues. On Thursday, the US expelled Russian officials and sanctioned Russian individuals and entities for election interference.

The US and the European Union have also slammed the Kremlin over the conflict in eastern Ukraine and for jailing Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny.

0,Hamas willing to accept less prisoner releases in exchange deal - report,https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/hamas-willing-to-accept-less-prisoner-releases-in-exchange-deal-report-665500,"Hamas may be willing to compromise on the number of prisoners released in a future exchange deal with Israel, but Israeli officials aren’t keeping their hopes up, security sources told Walla News on Sunday.

The news comes as security officials reportedly held talks with Hamas through Egyptian mediation about a week and a half ago on a possible prisoner swap, according to the report.

The talks reportedly took place while Ghassan Alian, head of the IDF unit Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, began his new job about two weeks ago. According to the report, Egyptian intelligence officers met with Israeli security officials at the Erez Crossing, and then continued into the Hamas-controlled area to speak with officials from the terrorist group.

The discussions took place over several hours, mostly concerning reaching an exchange agreement.

Security officials made it clear to Hamas that the terrorist group would need to compromise on the issue if they wanted economic progress, although representatives sent by Yahya Sinwar, leader of Hamas in Gaza, insisted on the release of hundreds of terrorists. The officials stated that “slow progress” had been made at the end of the talks, according to Walla.

Israeli officials do not have high expectations. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and National Security Council head Meir Ben Shabbat were informed about the details of the talks.

The news comes after two rockets were fired toward Israel from the Gaza Strip on Thursday night and Friday night, with the IDF responding by striking a number of targets belonging to Hamas throughout the coastal enclave.

0,France cuts two submarines in half to make one new one,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/14/europe/france-submarines-cut-in-half-intl-hnk-scli-ml/index.html,"(CNN) A French nuclear-powered submarine severely damaged by fire last year has been saved from the scrapyard -- by cutting it in two and welding the salvageable half to part of another decommissioned sub.

An intense 14-hour-long accidental fire on the attack submarine Perle while it was in dry dock for repairs last June left the front section of the boat unusable, according to the French Defense Ministry. It suffered structural damage to steel components that could not be repaired.

But the rear half of the 241-foot-long (73 meters) submarine, which has a displacement of 2,600 tons, was not damaged during the fire at a shipyard in Toulon, southern France.

The French submarine Perle is seen in Portsmouth, UK, in 2004.

Luckily for the French navy, one of the Perle's sister boats, the Saphir, which was retired from service in 2019, was awaiting dismantling at a shipyard in the northwestern port of Cherbourg.

The Saphir's front section was structurally sound, and French officials determined it could be mated with the rear of the Perle to make one serviceable attack submarine.

The damaged Perle was moved from Toulon to Cherbourg on a semi-submersibile ship in December.

Workers cut the Perle in half in February and did the same to the Saphir in March, according to a news release from French shipbuilder Naval Group.

Firefighters spray water on the submarine Perle (right) after a fire broke out on board while it underwent repairs in Toulon, France on June 12, 2020.

At the beginning of this month, the back half of the Perle and the front half of the Saphir were put on ""walkers"" at the Cherbourg shipyard so they could be carefully aligned and then welded together, the Naval Group release said.

Naval Group spokesperson Klara Nadaradjane said the joining work would be completed in the coming months.

The resulting submarine, which will still be called the Perle, will be about four-and-a-half feet (1.4 meters) longer than either of its predecessors to accommodate a ""junction area"" while the miles of cables and pipes that run through the sub will be spliced together, the release said.

The junction area will also provide room for new living quarters, adding a bit of space for the crew of 70 submariners.

Digital modeling

All that work will be rehearsed using a three-dimensional digital model before being attempted aboard the submarine, Naval Group said.

The task involves 100,000 hours of engineering studies and 250,000 hours of industrial work by 300 people, it said.

Nadaradjane said industry regulations did not allow the company to give a cost for the operation.

The Perle, commissioned in 1993, was the newest of what once were six Rubis-class nuclear submarines in the French fleet. The Saphir, the second boat in the class, was commissioned in 1984, serving 35 years before its decommissioning.

The French submarine Saphir is seen in this August 15, 2004, file photo.

The Rubis-class subs are scheduled to be replaced in coming years by the new Barracuda nuclear-powered submarines, the first of which, the Suffren, was delivered to the French navy in November. But the sixth Barracuda sub isn't expected to join the fleet until 2030, so the half-and-half Perle will be needed to keep French attack sub numbers at the required six, according to Naval Group.

Franck Ferrer, programs director for the Services Division of Naval Group, said in January that the new Perle was expected to be moved back to Toulon late this year for more technical work and upgrades to its combat systems before entering the French fleet in early 2023.

""Carrying out this type of project in these circumstances, i.e. repair work that involves joining the fore and aft ends of two sister ships, is of course a first in the modern history of Naval Group,"" Ferrer said.

Modern submarine construction

But it's not the first of its kind.

""The United States Navy did something similar to that when it replaced the bow of the damaged USS San Francisco, which ran aground on a seamount near Guam in 2005, with the bow of USS Honolulu, which was slated to be retired,"" said Thomas Shugart, a retired US Navy attack submarine commander.

And these kind of repairs beat starting from scratch, he said.

""For sure it would be a lot of work, but probably a lot less than building a whole new submarine,"" said Shugart, now a fellow at the Center for a New American Security.

Shugart said current submarine construction essentially does what the French are doing now in the Cherbourg shipyard.

""All new-construction US submarines are now built using modular construction, which is essentially putting pieces of submarine together, though clearly in a more planned-for fashion than in the case of this repaired French submarine,"" he said.

The rebirth of the Perle is certainly a better outcome than that experienced by another fire-damaged submarine, the USS Miami

0,$25 Million Worth Of Giant Clam Shells Seized In The Philippines : NPR,https://www.npr.org/2021/04/17/988432212/-25-million-worth-of-giant-clam-shells-seized-in-the-philippines,"$25 Million Worth Of Giant Clam Shells Seized In The Philippines

More than 200 tons of fossilized giant clam shells, worth nearly $25 million, were seized in a joint law enforcement raid in the Philippines' province of Palawan Friday. The Philippine Coast Guard said the haul was the largest to date in the province.

The Tridacna gigas, better known as a giant clam, or taklobo in the Philippines, is the largest living bivalve mollusk. They can grow larger than 4 feet across and weigh more than 400 lbs. It's also considered an endangered species by the Philippines' Department of Agriculture.

Four suspects, ranging in age from 40 to 54, have been taken into custody for violating the Wildlife Resources Conservation and Protection Act. They face up to eight years in prison and a fine equivalent to more than $62,000.

This was the third clam bust for the coast guard in just over a month. Another 18 tons was seized earlier in the week. The sum of that raid was just under $1.2 million. And in early March, another bust amounting to $3.3 million in value.

It is illegal to catch, gather, sell, purchase, possess or transport taklobo or any other protected species, the Philippines state news agency said.

It takes giant clams many years to reach full size, but they can live 100 years. Their shells provide a home to billions of algae, which give the clams' mantle such brilliant colors. They also filter out excess nutrients and pollutants while filter-feeding on plankton.

The Nanyang Technological University says poachers harvest the clams by dredging along the ocean floor and destroying coral reef systems with boat propellers. The shells are seen as a status symbol and can be used as ornaments, jewelry, tableware and even floor tiling.",296,1755,13,70
0,"China’s Dystopian “New IP"" Plan Shows Need for Renewed US Commitment to Internet Governance",https://www.justsecurity.org/75741/chinas-dystopian-new-ip-plan-shows-need-for-renewed-us-commitment-to-internet-governance/,"China released its 14th Five-Year plan for economic development last month, including its intended next steps in technology. The blueprint makes clear that, even before the ink is dry on many 5G contracts for broadband telecommunications, China and its networking giant Huawei are gearing up to ensure their vision of the internet goes global.

But Huawei’s plans for 6G and beyond make U.S. concerns over 5G look paltry: Huawei is proposing a fundamental internet redesign, which it calls “New IP,” designed to build “intrinsic security” into the web. Intrinsic security means that individuals must register to use the internet, and authorities can shut off an individual user’s internet access at any time. In short, Huawei is looking to integrate China’s “social credit,” surveillance, and censorship regimes into the internet’s architecture.

The New IP proposal itself rests on a flawed technical foundation that threatens to fragment the internet into a mess of less interoperable, less stable, and even less secure networks. To avoid scrutiny of New IP’s shortcomings, Huawei has circumvented international standards bodies where experts might challenge the technical shortcomings of the proposal. Instead, Huawei has worked through the United Nations’ International Telecommunications Union (ITU), where Beijing holds more political sway.

The appropriate place for a review of the New IP concept would be the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The IETF and other standards bodies are examining most of the technical changes to internet infrastructure that make up the New IP proposal, and these bodies have said it is premature to make a dramatic change without more information and consensus. Huawei’s plan to rebuild the internet from the top-down based on speculative-use cases – uses of the internet that might one day exist as opposed to an established use that current users or businesses are already clamoring for – bucks the logic of internet governance, which postulates that change should be incremental and based on established needs.

Authoritarian Blocs

Huawei’s and the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP’s) turn to the ITU is no surprise, even though the ITU’s jurisdiction does not include internet architecture. When it comes to internet governance, the CCP and other authoritarian regimes have long favored multilateral international institutions like the ITU over multistakeholder international institutions such as the IETF or the International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). Multistakeholder institutions are governed by a diverse array of representatives from industry, civil society, and government; multilateral institutions only provide voting power to national governments. In multistakeholder fora, civil society and industry representatives tend to favor a free and open internet, which dilutes the influence of national governments, many of whom are likely to favor a tightly regulated, censorable internet.

Authoritarian governments can marginalize private industry and citizens’ groups by working through multilateral fora such as the ITU, meaning the U.N. and the ITU will naturally be more receptive to proposals like New IP that grant national governments more control over the internet. In 2019, China and Russia leveraged a similar authoritarian bloc within the U.N. to pass a censorship-friendly cybercrime resolution. A comparable coalition of likeminded countries could help China push through the New IP proposal, shortcomings and all. Circumventing conventional internet-governance institutions in favor of the ITU also sets a precedent for future internet governance-related proposals to go through the ITU instead of more-balanced multistakeholder institutions.

What’s more, China has held the top position in the ITU for the last seven years. During his tenure as secretary-general of the ITU, Houlin Zhao of China has encouraged the expansion of the ITU’s mandate from just a telecommunications agency to a “technology agency” by working on technology unrelated to telecommunications such as internet architecture, the internet of things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI).

Organizing the U.S. Government for Success

Because of limitations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ITU’s World Telecommunication Standardization Assembly (WTSA-20), where New IP will be formally debated, has been delayed until February 2022. Therefore, Washington has time to prepare for, and confront, the first major referendum on New IP, even if it is in a less-desirable standards forum.

In its March 2020 report, the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission (CSC) highlighted another issue, the disparity between how the U.S. government engages at international fora like the ITU and the effort China is willing to make. In fact, New IP resulted in part from a previous U.S. abdication of presence and leadership, as the initial inquiry into the need for this new technology emerged out of a Huawei-dominated ITU focus group that lacked American input. This asymmetry in representation extends beyond that particular focus group. In the runup to the WTSA-20, China nominated representatives for management positions in virtually every ITU study group. Even when Chinese firms do not win leadership positions, China sends droves of meticulously prepared, synchronized delegations to push standards beneficial to Beijing and its national champions. By contrast, U.S. representatives appear to be prepared in an ad-hoc manner. The United States is officially competing for one-fourth the number of chairmanships or vice chairmanships as China at WTSA-20.

In past meetings, the United States has endeavored to keep the ITU focused on its appropriate areas of expertise (telecommunications) and stay away from intervening on other issues (the internet, artificial intelligence, blockchain, etc.) better suited to other standards bodies. The United States is correct to oppose ITU mission creep on principle. However, simply voicing principled opposition by itself is not enough to contain Chinese efforts to push ITU mission creep.

The CSC recommended that the United States make a concerted effort to compete with China on internet governance, and articulated that this effort will require (1) getting the U.S. government organized for success, (2) building effective public and private buy-in, and (3) working with like-minded international allies and partners.

Organized to Compete in International Fora

The first step is to get the U.S. government organized and resourced to compete with China in these fora. This requires the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) at the Department of Commerce, as well as the State Department and sector-specific agencies to work together to develop a strategic approach to dealing with issues like New IP at international fora. This will require increased funding for NIST. The establishment of a State Department Bureau for Cyberspace Policy, as laid out in the Cyber Diplomacy Act of 2021, would provide much of the organizational reform required. However, the State Department will require increased funding and focus to coordinate action and address the challenge of declining U.S. influence in internet governance and international digital standards.

A good first objective should be electing an ITU secretary-general who will respect the limitations of the ITU’s mandate and who is less amenable to government control over the internet. A U.S. representative, Doreen Bogdan-Martin, is running for the position in 2022. Even if Bogdan-Martin does not win the election, the United States should work to ensure the eventual winner will discontinue Zhao’s policy of ITU mission creep into areas such as New IP.

The worst-case scenario would be for Russia’s candidate, Rashid Ismailov, to win the secretary-generalship. Ismailov leads a delegation that routinely attempts to enhance the ITU’s power over internet governance at the expense of multistakeholder institutions. Ismailov is personally on record advocating for “providing governments and non-profit organizations with an opportunity to control activities” of ICANN, one of the most important multistakeholder bodies in internet governance. Ensuring Ismailov or a like-minded candidate does not win should be a top priority for the United States.

The second step toward ensuring the United States can compete effectively with China on internet governance is determining the optimal mix of incentives and prodding to get American firms to more actively represent U.S. interests. Historically, when the United States leaves engagement in international fora up to its private enterprises alone, American firms’ main incentive for participating becomes direct self-interest.

U.S. firms see limited incentives to make long-term commitments to slower-moving international fora such as the ITU’s standardization arm, the ITU-T. To put it another way, no firm wants to waste its resources playing defense against abstract, long-term threats such as Huawei’s plan to reinvent the internet. By contrast, Chinese firms receive financial incentives from the government to craft international standards and are publicly pressured into acting as a united front in these bodies.

This hands-off approach to public-private collaboration on the part of the United States is insufficient when it comes to international standard setting and is in part what allowed Huawei to assert influence in the standards bodies such as the ITU-T and 3GPP in recent years. U.S. government and industry must work together on the vast majority of issues where the two can agree and thus counter Chinese efforts.

Third, the United States needs to build coalitions of likeminded countries in internet-governance institutions. Strengthening ties and coordinating action with traditional allies is critical but insufficient. The United States also needs to find common ground with non-traditional partners that may not share U.S. values of an open internet but are also skeptical of a Chinese-led order. The 2019 Sino-Russian cybercrime resolution, which initiated the drafting process for a treaty that would enable governments to clamp down on free speech on the internet, passed in part because 34 countries abstained. Convincing countries like Mexico, Brazil, and the Philippines to oppose China’s power plays will be key to preventing initiatives like New IP from taking hold.

The United States cannot afford a similar failure to compete, as was the case in international fora associated with 5G development and international cybercrime. Chinese dominance in standardization will cost American firms market share and can open the door for more Chinese backdoors around the globe. Huawei dominance on New IP and 6G would not only create a less free, less interoperable internet, it would pave the way for authoritarian governments to gain expanded say over future changes to the internet for years to come.

The Chinese New IP proposal can be successfully contested, but only if the United States rallies its private-industry partners and like-minded international democratic governments to the cause. They must all work together to collectively rein in the threat of authoritarian governments using multilateral institutions such as the ITU to export their vision of the internet worldwide before it is too late.

Picture taken May 13, 2020. REUTERS/Flavio Lo Scalzo/File Photo

An Italian prosecutor has accused the World Health Organization (WHO) of hindering efforts to investigate allegations that Italy failed to prepare adequately for the coronavirus pandemic.

Prosecutors in the northern city of Bergamo, the epicentre of the deadly outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020, are also looking into accusations that WHO officials helped the Italian health ministry cover up its alleged shortcomings.

""Up until now we have just been met with a rubber wall,"" prosecutor Maria Cristina Rota told Reuters.

WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier denied that the United Nations agency was obstructing justice.

""It is WHO practice to always assist local authorities in such matters if requested and as appropriate. WHO is currently reviewing a request for international judiciary assistance from the office of the public prosecutor in Bergamo,"" he said.

The case has underscored concern about health management in Italy and raised questions over whether the WHO might be susceptible to pressure from member states to suppress potentially damaging information.

Almost 116,000 people have died of COVID-19 in Italy, the second highest tally in Europe after Britain, with the country still registering hundreds of deaths each day.

Rota said the Geneva-based WHO had rebuffed an initial request for help and demanded that any queries pass through formal diplomatic channels. This was done on March 8, but prosecutors have yet to hear back, she said.

Rota said the WHO had also failed to forward summonses to its staff to give witness statements to the prosecutors. ""Indeed, it encouraged everyone not to appear,"" she said.

As an international organisation, the WHO said its staff had diplomatic immunity. Spokesman Lindmeier said prosecutors had not sent a request to waiver immunity and did not provide the context in which the summons were being issued.

DAMNING REPORT PULLED

Bergamo prosecutors last year opened an investigation into the government's handling of the crisis and are reviewing allegations that the WHO conspired with Rome to suppress a damning report by its own researchers into the alleged failings of the Italian health system.

The report was posted on the WHO website on May 13, 2020, but was withdrawn the following day. Seen by Reuters, it said Italy's pandemic plan had not been updated since 2006 and said the response of local hospitals had been ""improvised, chaotic and creative"".

Italy repeatedly reassured the WHO that it had updated the plan in the years following 2006 but did not appear to have done so, a legal source said. The Italian health ministry did not respond to a request for a comment.

Francesco Zambon, who was lead writer on the WHO report, resigned from the agency last month, telling RAI TV his position had become unsustainable after he alleged that senior officials had pressured him to water down criticism of Italy.

The WHO's Lindmeier said the report was published prematurely and that the clearance process for releasing the report was not fully followed.

""The data and information contained in the report had not received final clearance and contained inaccuracies and inconsistencies,"" he told Reuters.

""If the requested actions had been completed the report could have been published normally, or re-published respectively,"" Lindmeier said.

Prosecutors say they are investigating whether the WHO pulled the report at the request of Ranieri Guerra, a special adviser at the agency. Guerra was director general for preventive health at Italy's health ministry between 2014 and 2017 and as such was responsible for the pandemic plan.

Guerra has denied being responsible for the removal of the report. He met Bergamo prosecutors in November and legal sources said last week that he was placed under investigation for allegedly lying during questioning.

He has denied that accusation, saying in a statement to the media that he was ""astonished and embittered by this situation. I do not know what they are talking about"".

It declared victory to the world after the first wave passed, and let its guard – and mask – down. The numbers are leaping from day to day at a speed that far outstrips last year’s. The huge election rallies, especially in Bengal, and the Maha Kumbh are almost certain to accelerate the spread of the infection. While it may be more localised in poll-bound states – that, at least, is the hope – there’s a deepening fear among public health officials that the dispersal of the millions who have congregated in Haridwar might act as a national super-spreader. The Prime Minister is to be commended for emphasising – during his recent interaction with chief ministers – the need to intensify testing, even if it results in a spike in caseload.Nowhere is that need for testing on a war-footing greater than in Haridwar today. And that must be followed – without an hour’s delay – by a massive tracing and containment exercise. It’s too late to argue over whether such a massive gathering should have been allowed in the first place. What the Uttarakhand government and the Centre need to do now is act with the greatest urgency in checking the spread of the virus.

The administration doesn’t have any record of the total number of Covid deaths among those attending the religious fair. Of the 13,415 tested on Wednesday, 119 were positive; 79,301 people were tested since April 12 and 745 found positive.Secretary of the Niranjani Akhada Mahant Ravindra Puri said that “most of the saints and their followers” in the camps at Haridwar have Covid-19 like symptoms due to which saints of the akhada have decided to end the mela from April 17.Director-general of health Dr Tripati Bahuguna said, “The private hospital where Mahamandaleshwar Kapil Dev Das was admitted has shared information with the health department that the seer was admitted to their facility on April 12 and he breathed his last on April 13. He had kidney ailments before Covid-19 struck him. He was undergoing dialysis too.”The place in Kankhal where the seer had been camping houses 10,000 more saints and followers. Haridwar CMO Dr SK Jha said a health department team would visit the area on Friday, sanitise it and collect samples of all those staying there.Meanwhile, 33 policemen on their way back from Kumbh (between January and April 15) also tested positive.Many of them had reportedly taken both doses of the coronavirus vaccine.This came even as Mahant Hari Giri, general secretary of Akhada Parishad , apex body of all 13 akhadas, said, “It is right that (Covid) cases are increasing and we are discussing with the representatives of all 13 akhadas about the situation.

The cross on top of Hungary's largest church, the magnificent Esztergom Cathedral, has been hiding a 176-year-old time capsule that was only recovered during renovation work this year.

The sealed copper canister was inside the cross on the 100-metre dome, the highest in Hungary, which survived being bombed during World War Two.

The container was also badly damaged by shrapnel but when they opened it, historians discovered documents in near-perfect condition relating to the cathedral's construction.

Csaba Torok, director of the Cathedral's Treasury, said the papers gave a rare glimpse of the time when the church was built from 1822 onwards.

The cylindrical capsule was placed in the cross in 1845 by Archbishop Jozsef Kopacsy and chief architect Jozsef Hild, who took over after his predecessor was murdered.

""Archbishop Kopacsy knew he would not be able to complete the construction in his lifetime, so when the cross was finished he wanted to leave inside an imprint of the memory of the builders and of that era,"" Torok said.

The best moment was when they found the documents: one depicting milestones in the construction and a book containing names of clergymen and parishes.

""These were last touched by human hands when they were placed there 176 years ago, so somehow we felt a sudden connection in time,"" he said.

The Catholic cathedral was built on Castle Hill, where a church was first founded over a 1,000 years ago. Its iron dome was built in Vienna and carried in sections down the Danube on barges.

For its consecration in 1856, Hungarian composer and pianist Franz Liszt composed a mass. But the cathedral was still not finished, with the main portico and interior only completed later in the 19th century.

0,Whitest paint ever created could have air-con like cooling effects,https://newatlas.com/materials/whitest-paint-ever-air-con-cooling-effects/,"The materials we coat our buildings with can have a big influence on their ability to reflect heat from the Sun and overall energy efficiency. Engineers at Purdue University have been at the cutting edge of this field of research for some time, and have just produced the whitest paint ever created, which they say reflects 98.1 percent of sunlight and can produce cooling effects that are on par with common air conditioners.

Upping the performance of white paints so that they reflect higher amounts of solar radiation is a common goal among researchers looking to keep living spaces cooler and lessen our reliance on air conditioners and other energy-intensive cooling systems. One NASA study from 2021 found that white coatings on New York City rooftops could reduce their peak temperatures by an average of 43 °F (24 °C), for example. We've also seen scientists cook up highly reflective paints made from glass, and others that incorporate Teflon to reflect up to 98 percent of incoming radiation.

The Purdue University scientists had recently shown off an ultra-white paint capable of reflecting 95.5 percent of sunlight. This material already far exceeds commercially available heat-reflecting paints that bounce away 80 to 90 percent of sunlight, but now the researchers are upping their game even further.

Their new ultra-white paint owes its excellent performance to a careful mix of particles made from barium sulfate, which is a chemical compound used in white photographic paper and cosmetics. These particles can make the paint very white and very reflective, but there is a line to be drawn in terms of compromising its performance, with too high a concentration causing the paint to peel off or break apart.

But by varying the size of the particles, the scientists can alter each one's ability to scatter light, with a wider range of particle sizes resulting in a paint that can scatter more of the light spectrum coming from the Sun. The team has now landed on just right recipe to produce the whitest paint ever made, and therefore the coolest paint on record.

“A high concentration of particles that are also different sizes gives the paint the broadest spectral scattering, which contributes to the highest reflectance,” says Joseph Peoples, a Purdue Ph.D. student in mechanical engineering.

An infrared camera image demonstrates how a sample of the whitest white paint can cool a board or surface below ambient temperature Purdue University/Joseph Peoples

The paint was put to the test outdoors where it was found to keep surfaces 19 °F (10.5 °C) cooler than their ambient surroundings at night time, and 8 °F (4.5 °C) cooler under strong sunlight during the middle of the day. In one outdoor test during the middle of winter in ambient temperatures of 43 °F (6.1 °C), the paint lowered the temperature of a surface by 18 °F (10 °C).

“If you were to use this paint to cover a roof area of about 1,000 square feet (93 sq m), we estimate that you could get a cooling power of 10 kilowatts,"" says Xiulin Ruan, a Purdue professor of mechanical engineering. ""That’s more powerful than the central air conditioners used by most houses.""

The research was published in the journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.

While states are announcing strict restrictions to curb the spread of the virus, cases are spiralling in Haridwar as lakhs take a dip in the holy water completely disregarding safety protocols. The Maha Kumbh Mela is witnessing a footfall of lakhs of pilgrims every day amid the second wave of coronavirus in the country.

#WATCH Devotees in large numbers gathered at Har ki Pauri today ahead of Ganga aarti, in Haridwar



'Shahi Snan' scheduled to be held on 12th and 14th April during Haridwar Kumbh#Uttarakhand pic.twitter.com/wYcSgh4Nhu — ANI (@ANI) April 11, 2021

Defending the crowd and the massive religious congregation, UP BJP leader Sunil Bharala, in an interview with NDTV, said, ""Kumbh ki aastha coronavirus see bhaut badi hai (faith of Kumbh is above Coronavirus).""

The BJP leader said that he had attended the Kumbh Mela and tested positive for COVID on April 13.

The leader brazenly said that faith and religious beliefs are above all COVID norms and guidelines.

""I went to Kumbh myself. I am COVID-19 positive.""

""Dharma is above any corona guidelines"".

When asked about the massive crowds gathered for the religious congregation, the BJP leader said that the massive celebration is to ward off COVID and that ""Ganga ma"" will fight the virus. He also said that the Maha Kumbh cannot be compared to the Markaz as all protocols are being followed in Haridwar.

So Sunil Bharala, UP Minister (Labour Welfare Council) in his interview with NDTV, in relation to the Kumbh Mela, said that religion is above covid norms and guidelines. Let that sink in. — Nupur Thapliyal (@nupur_0111) April 14, 2021

Any virus loves crowds, but it adores crowds that violate all safety protocols.



The grand celebration in the name of ""faith"" in Haridwar has worsened the ongoing health crisis in the country. The careless message sent by the state government of Uttarakhand which refuses to curtail the event has added to the collective irresponsibility of the public amid a pandemic.

0,Speculation tips Australian buyout of Toll business unit,https://www.trailermag.com.au/speculation-tips-australian-buyout-of-toll-business-unit/,"A power player in rebuilding businesses and developing talent through transformational capital is touted by mainstream media as a potential purchaser of Toll Global Express.

Speculation via several media outlets – including Australian Financial Review – suggests private equity business, Allegro Funds, could snap up Toll’s business unit which is up for sale.

Allegro, a Sydney-based enterprise founded by Chester Moynihan and Adrian Loader in 2004, recently partnered with Euro Garages Australia and opened its second Pizza Hut kiosk in a New South Wales service station. The move was reportedly part of an initial transformation strategy to boost Pizza Hut Australia’s market share back to the top.

The firm, since investing institutional capital, has managed more than $1 billion of total enterprise value in turnaround and special situation investments.

Allegro currently has investments spanning healthcare, retail, industrial, education, food manufacturing, oil and gas, quick service restaurant, mining, flooring and tourism.

This optimistic acquisition would see Australian ownership rather than an alternative deal with US-based private equity company, Platinum Equity.

If such a deal was to proceed the Australian freight forwarding business, comprising 8,000-plus employees, worth an estimated worth of $3.2 billion would be on the table.

November last year, Toll said in a statement it was exploring the potential sale of Toll Global Express.

The Global Logistics and Global Forwarding businesses, Toll clarified at the time, would not be impacted.

Toll also explained there would be no certainty that such a transaction would occur and will make further announcements on the subject as it deems appropriate.

In other news, Toll partnered with Soldier On, a charity focused on supporting the needs of the Australian veteran community.

In March, Toll New Zealand reported three-fold productivity gains following the opening of a new site.",292,1960,8,56
0,"For the first time, scientists have created embryos that are part human and part monkey",http://www.thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/medical-advances/548535-for-the-first-time-scientists-have-created,"Scientists have created embryos for the first time that are part human and part monkey, according to a new study released in the journal Cell on Thursday.

The team of scientists who collaborated on the study stated the embryos were created as research for new ways to produce organs for organ transplants. However, the research has been controversial within the science community, with some bioethicists debating the ethics behind the creation.

""My first question is: Why?” Kirstin Matthews, a fellow for science and technology at Rice University's Baker Institute, told NPR. ""I think the public is going to be concerned, and I am as well, that we're just kind of pushing forward with science without having a proper conversation about what we should or should not do.""

The ethical concerns vary. One is that the research could go further and result in someone trying to create a fetus, in which the brain that develops would also be part human, part animal. Such entities are known as chimeras, stemming from Greek mythology.

America is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.

""Should it be regulated as human because it has a significant proportion of human cells in it? Or should it be regulated just as an animal? Or something else?"" Matthews said. ""At what point are you taking something and using it for organs when it actually is starting to think and have logic?""

Another leading worry is the possibility it produces animals that then carry human sperm or eggs.

""Nobody really wants monkeys walking around with human eggs and human sperm inside them. Because if a monkey with human sperm meets a monkey with human eggs, nobody wants a human embryo inside a monkey's uterus,"" said Hank Greely, a Stanford University bioethicist. Greely co-wrote an article in the same issue of Cell critiquing this line of research, though he noted that the specific study in question was carried out ethically.

However, the scientists involved in the study stand behind their research and say it could be instrumental in solving one of medicine’s biggest issues.

""This is one of the major problems in medicine — organ transplantation,"" Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, a professor in the Gene Expression Laboratory of the Salk Institute for Biological Sciences and a co-author of the study, told NPR. ""The demand for that is much higher than the supply.""

In the research, Belmonte and a team of scientists injected 25 human induced pluripotent stem cells into the embryos of macaque monkeys, which share close genetic similarities to humans.

On the first day, researchers detected human cells growing within 132 of the embryos. The team studied the embryos for 19 days to gain insight into how human and animal cells communicate, with the aim of one day discovering how to grow organs in animals that can be used for human transplantation.

""This knowledge will allow us to go back now and try to re-engineer these pathways that are successful for allowing appropriate development of human cells in these other animals,"" Belmonte said. ""We are very, very excited.""

Organ transplantation is a cause for concern in the United States, with the need consistently outpacing the availability. According to the U.S. Government Information on Organ Donation and Transplantation, 39,000 organ transplants were conducted in 2020. As of February 2021, more than 107,000 were on the waiting list for an organ transplant, and 17 people die every day while waiting for one.

The coronavirus pandemic has caused heightened concern about the availability of organs for transplantation. The damage COVID-19 does on the organs, especially the lungs, combined with that of the long-term use of a ventilator in some patients has sparked a new wave of transplant patients.

New data released by the United Network for Organ Sharing found that 59 transplants due to COVID-19-related organ disease occurred in the United States through March 31. Of these transplants, 54 were lung transplants, four were heart transplants, and one was a combination lung-heart transplant.

“I think this is just the beginning,” said Tae Song, surgical director of the lung transplant program at the University of Chicago Medical Center. “I expect this to be a completely new category of transplant patients.”

Even if he appears to be focused on driving the car or reading peacefully next to you in bed, his thoughts are almost certainly racing with multiple ways he could end things right then and there.” Hagerty added that on the majority of occasions when a boyfriend says “I love you,” he’s actually preparing to segue into a rehearsed breakup speech.",226,1369,13,88

1,Small Kindnesses: Gamer Shields Ailing Grandmother From News So She Can Die Believing ‘Cyberpunk 2077’ Patch Largely Fixes It,https://ogn.theonion.com/small-kindnesses-gamer-shields-ailing-grandmother-from-1846694967,"While gamers have a reputation for being mostly focused on fandom and fun, some members of this community really demonstrate why having a good heart is the number-one asset for a gamer. Enter Jason Langley, a 25-year-old Sony diehard who has shielded his ailing grandmother Dorothy from gaming news so she can die believing that the Cyberpunk 2077 1.2 patch largely fixes the glitch-ridden dystopian epic.

Dorothy may have congestive heart failure and mere weeks to live, but thanks to her loving son, she’ll pass away peacefully still thinking that CD Projekt Red’s open-world RPG is everything the developer promised in their E3 2018 demo and more!

“At 93 years of age, my grandma only has one thing that’s keeping her going, and that’s seeing Cyberpunk run on PS4 Pro at a rock-solid 30 frames per second or higher, which unfortunately seems like it’s never going to happen,” Langley told us in an interview from his grandmother’s hospital room, downplaying his efforts as simply what any loving grandson would do. “In some ways, it’s heartbreaking to feel her tug on my sleeve and hear her say, ‘Jason, what about the cop spawning? Did they fix that? Does V at least sleep in her bed vertically like a normal person? Christ, they had years to get this right. How did they fuck this up so badly?’ But I just want to make sure my grandma is as comfortable as she can be, and there’s no way I can do that if she’s obsessing about whether Cyberpunk’s chase sequences are even playable on base consoles.”

“God, this thing is a piece of shit,” he added.



What makes this a truly heartwarming story is how hard Jason has worked: Whenever his grandmother asked about how Cyberpunk’s minimap zoom problem was doing, he was there to distract her with a hug or a blanket to keep her warm. Any time he saw her scrolling through a Digital Foundry impression video to check out if there are still T-posed NPCs floating off into the sky above Night City, he was there to bring up her relatives on a Zoom call to wish her all their love or ask how her medication was working that day. Gamers, it’s enough to bring a tear to your eye!

Some late-breaking news ties a bow on this inspiring story. After Jason brought his grandma a doctored-up article confirming that the game is now essentially bug-free—and that a hotfix even removed the nightmarish repeated character model glitch–Dorothy agreed to enter hospice care, where she passed away with a smile on her face last night, secure in her knowledge that CD Projekt Red had produced a worthy sci-fi successor to The Witcher 3.

Really, the bulging vein on his forehead is what gives him away, along with the few million other Americans who look just like him.” At press time, Bowdich had confirmed that the plethora of written and video evidence of the man posted on social media also meant the FBI believed they could start questioning suspects by mid-2022.

Are we all out of money now that you’re not president no more?” asked Eric, 36, wiping away tears and snot from his face as he struggled to shatter his Minecraft piggy bank. “I have six paper money and a whole handful of these metal circles, hopefully that can help.

Please note that with tougher pieces of gristle or a stale bread heel this whole process may take several tries.” HHS officials went on to announce they had updated the universal sign for choking to include a motion in which one pantomimes eating a hoagie.",189,1165,16,107
0,Iran has named a suspect it alleges is responsible for the attack on the country’s vital nuclear site in Natanz.,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/iran-nuclear-natanz-attack-suspect-b1833238.html,"Iran has named a suspect it alleges is responsible for the attack on the country’s nuclear facility in Natanz.

The incident at the country’s main uranium enrichment facility last week – which Tehran quickly blamed on Israel – cast a shadow over vital ongoing talks in Vienna aimed at salvaging the international deal intended to block Iran’s route to creating a nuclear arsenal.

Iranian state TV said on Saturday that intelligence officials had named Reza Karimi, a 43-year-old born in the city Kashan, as the “perpetrator of this sabotage”.

The report accused Mr Karimi of fleeing the country “hours before” the attack at the Ahmadi Roshan facility, which Iranian president Hassan Rouhani gave as justification for Tehran’s decision to start enriching uranium to a purity of up to 60 per cent – levels well above the 3.67 per cent limit enshrined in the nuclear deal currently under discussion and strong enough to be used in a so-called “dirty bomb”.

“Necessary steps are under way for his arrest and return to the country through legal channels,” the report said, also broadcasting an image which appeared to show an Interpol Red Notice seeking Mr Karimi’s arrest.

The arrest notice was not available on Interpol’s public-facing database at the time of publication, and the international agency did not respond to a request by The Independent for clarification on whether one had been issued.

The apparent Interpol Red Notice listed his travel history as including Ethiopia, Kenya, the Netherlands, Qatar, Romania, Turkey, Uganda and the United Arab Emirates. The state TV report did not elaborate how Mr Karimi would have gained access to one of the most secure facilities in the Islamic Republic.

Alireza Zakani, an MP who heads up the Iranian parliament’s research centre, was quoted widely this week as saying the attack had damaged and destroyed thousands of centrifuges – machines used to refine uranium. However, no other official has offered such an estimate, and no photos of the aftermath have been released.

Israel has not officially confirmed or denied involvement, but media outlets in the country initially reported that the damage was the result of a cyberattack, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying hours after the attack that “the struggle against Iran and its proxies and the Iranian armament efforts is a huge mission”. A previous Mossad-CIA operation in 2010 targeted the facility with a computer virus, reportedly setting Iran’s nuclear ambitions back several years.

But the TV report by Islamic Republic Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) on Saturday spoke of a “limited explosion of a small part of the electricity-feeding path to the centrifuges' hall”, adding: “The explosion happened because of the function of explosive materials and there was no cyberattack.”

The report also showed centrifuges in a hall, as well as what appeared to be caution tape at the Natanz facility. In one shot, a reporter interviewed an unnamed technician, who said: “The sound that you are hearing is the sound of operating machines that are fortunately undamaged.”

The man – filmed from behind to hide his identity – claimed that “many of the centrifuge chains that faced defects are now under control, adding: “Part of the work that had been disrupted will be back on track with the round-the-clock efforts of my colleagues.”

Meanwhile, in Vienna, negotiations seeking to rescue the nuclear deal, called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), continued on Saturday, with diplomats on both sides suggesting difficult progress had been made.

“We think that the talks have reached a stage where parties are able to begin to work on a joint draft,” said Iranian negotiator Abbas Araghchi. “It seems that a new understanding is taking shape, and now there is agreement over final goals.”

And Enrique Mora, the European Union official who chaired the talks, tweeted that “progress has been made in a far from easy task”, adding: “We need now more detailed work.”

Saturday’s meeting saw diplomats from the five powers remaining in the deal – the UK, France, Russia, China and Germany – reconvene for talks, with expert-level working groups on sanctions lifting and nuclear activities set to continue in the coming week.

Despite several failed attempts to resume negotiations, it is the first time such a meeting has been held since former US president Donald Trump announced in 2018 that he was pulling out of the deal struck by his predecessor Barack Obama three years prior, and was reimposing punishing economic sanctions on Iran, which has since been wracked by recession.

While the White House’s new occupant Joe Biden is keen to rejoin the nuclear deal, Tehran’s interest lies – ahead of looming elections – in seeing the lifting of sanctions, the impacts of which have been felt harshly by Iranian residents.

While one EU diplomat told Agence France-Presse earlier this week that Sunday’s attack and Iran’s nuclear response had “complicated” discussions in Vienna, Ali Vaez of the International Crisis Group think tank was quoted as saying that the events had added “urgency” to the talks by reminding “both parties that the status quo is a lose-lose situation”.

“It is clear that the more the diplomatic process drags on, the higher the risk that it gets derailed by saboteurs and those acting in bad faith,” Mr Vaez said.

Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful, and an annual US intelligence report released on Tuesday maintained the longtime American assessment that Iran isn’t currently trying to build a nuclear bomb.

The country’s newly announced intention to enrich uranium up to 60 per cent purity would still fall significantly below the 90 per cent purity required for a modern nuclear weapon – but it is three times higher than its previous efforts.

Iran previously had said it could use uranium enriched up to 60 per cent for nuclear-powered ships, however it currently has no such ships in its navy.

After a long day at work, I just want to come home and be cheered up, whether it’s with him pretending to have Tourette’s, calling Kyle a ‘Jew,’ or infecting his friend with HIV. The thing about attraction is that looks may fade, but being my ‘fatty doo doo’ is forever.” At press time, Burton emphasized that while Cartman was fun, for the long term, it might be wiser to date someone sensitive like Butters or a great listener like Mr. Mackey.

1,Nation's Experts Give Up,https://politics.theonion.com/nations-experts-give-up-1819565216,"WASHINGTON, DC—Citing years of frustration over their advice being misunderstood, misrepresented or simply ignored, America's foremost experts in every field collectively tendered their resignation Monday.

Left: Child-rearing expert Dr. Patrick Coughlin and Korean War expert Dr. Laurence Block field reporters' questions following the mass resignation of America's 243,839 experts.

""Despite all our efforts to advise this nation, America still throws out its recyclables, keeps its guns in unlocked cabinets where children have easy access, eats three times as much red meat as is recommended, watches seven hours of TV per day, swims less than 10 minutes after eating, and leaves halogen lights on while unattended,"" said Dr. Simon Peavy, vice-president of the National Association of Experts. ""Since you don't seem to care about things you don't understand, screw you. We quit.""

""My final piece of expert advice,"" Peavy added, ""is that all of you people should just go fuck yourselves.""

Michael Leland, until recently a Department of Energy advisor specializing in planetary energy-use infrastructures and a leading expert in petrochemical and fossil-fuel depletion, maintained that the experts' mass resignation is justified.

""Last year, I testified before Congress that at the current rate of consumption, the planet's supply of coal, natural gas and oil would be gone within 40 years, and they looked at me as if I was some sort of crackpot,"" Leland said. ""What's the point?""

""We'll say it one last time before we pack up and go: In 20 years, you'll be up to your asses in old folks,"" a written statement from the National Advisory Council On Aging read in part. ""Since America has not yet begun making preparations for the explosion in its senior population, we recommend that you begin research on federally funded, hydroelectrically powered 'eldercution camps,' where the teeming hordes of the aged can be disposed of quickly and painlessly.""

According to Peavy, despite the vast amounts of scientifically proven and historically sound advice provided by the nation's experts, the National Association of Experts could cite no instances of advice being followed in the manner they had intended.

""Public reaction was favorable to the news that a glass of wine a day can help prevent heart attacks,"" Peavy said. ""Of course, most people figured that eight glasses of wine a day must be better than one. And many Americans reacted well to the news that eggs probably wouldn't kill them outright. Aside from that, they've pretty much ignored every word we've ever said concerning just about everything.""

Because the experts' advice was barely followed, the mass resignation is expected to have little impact on the lives of most Americans.

""Go ahead, America,"" Peavy said. ""You don't need us. Watch all the topsoil go down the Mississippi. Transport your children in baskets on top of your SUV deathmobiles. Keep playing with your cute and cuddly pal, the atom. Press your nose against the TV screen for even more educational 3rd Rock From The Sun enjoyment. Use plentiful gasoline to burn book- readers at the stake. Don't eat anything but sugared pork lard. Do whatever you want.""

Despite its negligible impact on the population at large, the sudden dearth of experts is expected to be devastating for the American media, particularly TV newsmagazines, which have come to heavily rely on experts for their incisive, time-filling punditry.

""How in the world are we supposed to do a story on how the Internet is changing the face of Christianity without Internet and Christianity experts?"" said Dateline NBC executive producer Russell Ross. ""How can we report on the stress-relieving impact of whale songs without top psychotherapists and marine biologists to offer their perspective? Without the insight of professors and best-selling authors, a TV special report has no credibility. It may well mean the end of American telejournalism as we know it.""

According to FDA spokesperson Jonathan Landau, the exiting advisors will be missed, but the nation must move forward.

""We, of course, are deeply saddened to lose America's most knowledgeable individuals in every field,"" Landau said. ""But at the same time, it's important to recognize that their advice, however well-informed or well-intentioned, was almost always impractical.""

Landau said he plans to fill his own vacant advisory positions with ""positive-minded, people-friendly sexperts, advice columnists and astrologers"" as soon as funding can be arranged.",718,4607,4,24

Witnesses told Amnesty International that Eritrean troops were passing through the town located in the Tigray region, when they suddenly opened fire at people on the main street close to the bus station.

“Three people lost their lives and at least 19 others are in hospital from yet another unlawful attack by Eritrean troops on civilians in Tigray. Deliberate attacks on civilians are prohibited by international humanitarian law and must stop,” said Sarah Jackson, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes.

“We are calling for an international investigation into this and other incidents and allegations of human rights violations, including war crimes and possible crimes against humanity, committed in the ongoing conflict in Tigray”.

Six witnesses told Amnesty International that the some of the injured were taken to Don Bosco hospital in Adwa town, and 19 of them were rushed to Axum referral hospital for advanced medical care.

Teklu*, who works in the bus station told Amnesty International: “The Eritrean soldiers on the back of one Ural military truck and another heavy truck started shooting. We scattered in different directions. I hid in the drainage. We knew that they are Eritreans soldiers because they were swearing in Tigrinya, the heavy trucks had Eritrean number plates and Eritrean defense force camouflages. They were shooting from the backs of the moving trucks”.

There must be justice and accountability for war crimes and human rights violations in Tigray. This attack and other allegations of violations must be independently and impartially investigated by an international inquiry Sarah Jackson, Amnesty International's Deputy Regional Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes

Sertse*, who was also near the bus station at the time of the incident, told Amnesty International: “I was walking from my shop which is near the PanAfric hotel towards the bus station. The shooting started immediately after the two trucks passed me. There were rickshaws on the road and the soldiers on the first truck were shouting in Tigrinya to the rickshaw drivers to clear off the road. Then the soldiers on the second truck started shooting. There were many people on the street”.

According to a member of the medical staff at Axum University Teaching and Referral Hospital, all of the people that were received at the hospital had either been shot in their chests, stomachs, legs, and hands, and six of them were in critical condition as of 13 April. The staffer said one girl was in shock due to blood loss, and that other patients had suffered broken hands and legs.

Solomon*, another witness, said: “The Eritrean soldiers came on two heavy trucks from the Adi Abun area. I was on the road just outside of my home when the shooting started at around 8 am. It was sudden and I thought there was a gunfight going on in the area. In fact, there was no fighting but just shooting at passersby. One of the deceased was killed just five metres from my home. He died instantly. I saw him”.

“There must be justice and accountability for war crimes and human rights violations in Tigray. This attack and other allegations of violations must be independently and impartially investigated by an international inquiry. Ethiopia and Eritrea must fully cooperate with such investigations and ensure full reparation for victims and their families”, said Sarah Jackson.",592,3623,14,86
0,Pakistan PM: Insulting Islam’s Prophet Should Be Same as Denying Holocaust,https://www.voanews.com/south-central-asia/pakistan-pm-insulting-islams-prophet-should-be-same-denying-holocaust,"ISLAMABAD - Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan is urging Western governments to criminalize any insulting remarks against Islam’s Prophet Muhammad and treat offenders the same way they do those who deny the Holocaust.

Khan spoke Saturday after violent nationwide protests this week by a radical Islamist party demanding expulsion of the French ambassador over the publication of cartoons in France depicting the prophet, an act condemned as blasphemous.

Khan tweeted: “Those in the West, incl extreme right politicians, who deliberately indulge in such abuse & hate under guise of freedom of speech clearly lack moral sense & courage to apologize to the 1.3 bn Muslims for causing this hurt.”

He also called on Western governments that have outlawed negative comments about the Holocaust ""to use the same standards to penalize those deliberately spreading their message of hate against Muslims by abusing our Prophet.”

I also call on Western govts who have outlawed any negative comment on the holocaust to use the same standards to penalise those deliberately spreading their message of hate against Muslims by abusing our Prophet PBUH. — Imran Khan (@ImranKhanPTI) April 17, 2021

Many European countries have laws that criminalize the Holocaust denial, an act of negating the Nazi genocide of European Jews, and offenders can end up in jail.

Activists of the radical Islamist party Tehreek-i-Labaik Pakistan protested in the streets Monday shortly after Pakistani authorities arrested their leader, Saad Rizvi.

Officials defended the arrest, saying Rizvi was planning to march on Islamabad, with thousands of supporters set to besiege the capital to pressure the government to expel the French ambassador.

Thousands of angry protesters blocked key highways, causing traffic jams, paralyzing business and routine life for three days in Pakistan. Police attempts to disperse the protesters sparked violent clashes that killed four law enforcers and injured more than 600 others.

The demonstrations were eventually dispersed, but the unprecedented direct attacks on police provoked the government Thursday to outlaw TLP for indulging in terrorist attacks against the state.

Khan on Saturday defended the ban on TLP and vehemently dismissed suggestions the move had stemmed from international pressure on Pakistan.

“Let me make clear to people here & abroad: Our govt only took action against TLP under our anti-terrorist law when they challenged the writ of the state and used street violence & attacking the public & law enforcers,” the prime minister wrote on Twitter. “No one can be above the law and the Constitution.”

TLP leaders have recently organized several major street protests, disrupting routine life and business in the country.

Along with demonstrations against France, the extremist group has pressured the Pakistani government into not repealing or reforming the country’s harsh blasphemy laws, which critics say often are used to intimidate religious minorities and settle personal disputes.

French urged to leave

On Thursday, France advised citizens and companies to temporarily leave Pakistan, citing “serious threats to French interests” in the South Asian nation.

Most of the French nationals are said to have ignored the advisory, however, and have chosen to stay in Pakistan, the AFP news agency reported Saturday.

0,42 migrants dead after boat from Yemen capsizes off Djibouti coast,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/13/africa/migrants-dead-djibouti-intl/index.html,"(CNN) At least 42 migrants have died after a boat they were travelling in from Yemen capsized off the coast of Djibouti, East Africa, during the early hours of Monday morning, the United Nations' International Organization for Migration (IOM) said on Tuesday.

The IOM's Regional Director for East and the Horn of Africa, Mohammed Abdiker, also tweeted Tuesday that ""grim pictures"" of ""children's bodies ashore"" have now emerged. A tweet from Abdiker earlier said that at least 16 children (8 boys and 8 girls) were among the dead.

A press release from the IOM on Tuesday said that the 60 ""migrants were being transported by people smugglers"" from Yemen to Djibouti and that this was the second tragedy of this nature ""in just over a month.""

Last month's tragedy saw smugglers throw 80 people overboard due to overcrowding, causing at least 20 people to drown, the press release said.

""Every year, tens of thousands of young African migrants from the region make the dangerous journey from countries like Somalia and Ethiopia through Djibouti and Yemen in search for work in the Gulf,"" according to the press release.

0,"India, Pakistan held secret talks on Kashmir in January: Reuters | Border Disputes News",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/15/india-pakistan-held-secret-talks-on-kashmir-in-january-reuters,"Top intelligence officers from the two nuclear-armed nations met in Dubai in bid to calm tension over the disputed Himalayan region, report says.

Top intelligence officers from India and Pakistan held secret talks in Dubai in January in a new effort to calm military tension over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, people with close knowledge of the matter have told the Reuters news agency in New Delhi.

Ties between the nuclear-armed rivals have been on ice since a suicide bombing of an Indian military convoy in Kashmir in 2019 was traced to Pakistan-based fighters that led to India sending warplanes to Pakistan.

Later that year, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi withdrew Indian-ruled Kashmir’s autonomy in order to tighten his grip over the Muslim-majority territory, provoking outrage in Pakistan and the downgrading of diplomatic ties and suspension of bilateral trade.

But the two governments have reopened a back channel of diplomacy aimed at a modest road map to normalising ties over the next several months, the sources told Reuters.

Kashmir has long been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan, both of which claim all of the region but rule only in part.

Officials from India’s Research and Analysis Wing, the external spy agency and Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) travelled to Dubai for a meeting facilitated by the United Arab Emirates government, two people said.

The Indian foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Pakistan’s military, which controls the ISI, also did not respond.

But Ayesha Siddiqa, a noted Pakistani defence analyst, said she believed Indian and Pakistan intelligence officials had been meeting for several months in other countries.

“I think there have been meetings in Thailand, in Dubai, in London between the highest-level people,” she said.

Such meetings have taken place in the past as well, especially during times of crises but never been publicly acknowledged.

“There is a lot that can still go wrong, it is fraught,” said one of the people in New Delhi. “That is why nobody is talking it up in public, we don’t even have a name for this, it’s not a peace process. You can call it a re-engagement,” one of them said.

Both countries have reasons to seek a rapprochement.

India has been locked in a border confrontation with China since last year and does not want the military stretched on the Pakistan front.

China’s ally, Pakistan, mired in economic difficulties and on an International Monetary Fund (IMF) rescue programme, can ill-afford heightened tensions on the Kashmir border for a prolonged period, experts say. It also has to stabilise the Afghan border on its west as the United States withdraws.

“It’s better for India and Pakistan to talk than not talk, and even better that it should be done quietly than in a glare of publicity,” said Myra MacDonald, a former Reuters journalist who has just published a book on India, Pakistan and war on the frontiers of Kashmir.

“… But I don’t see it going very far beyond a basic management of tensions, possibly to tide both countries over a difficult period – Pakistan needs to address the fallout of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, while India has to confront a far more volatile situation on its disputed frontier with China.”

Following the January meeting, India and Pakistan announced they would stop cross-border shooting along the Line of Control (LoC) dividing Kashmir which has left dozens of civilians dead and many others maimed. That ceasefire is holding, military officials in both countries said.

Both sides have also signalled plans to hold elections on their sides of Kashmir this year as part of efforts to bring normality to a region riven by decades of bloodshed.

The two have also agreed to dial down their rhetoric, the people Reuters spoke to said.

This would include Pakistan dropping its loud objections to Modi abrogating Kashmir’s autonomy in August 2019, while New Delhi in turn would refrain from blaming Pakistan for all violence on its side of the LoC.

These details have not been previously reported. India has long blamed Pakistan for the revolt in Indian-administered Kashmir, an allegation denied by Pakistan.

“There is a recognition there will be attacks inside Kashmir, there has been discussions as to how to deal with it and not let this effort derailed by the next attack,” one of the people Reuters talked to said.

There is as yet, however, no grand plan to resolve the 74-year-old Kashmir dispute. Rather both sides are trying to reduce tensions to pave the way for a broad engagement, all the people Reuters spoke to said.

“Pakistan is transiting from a geostrategic domain to a geo-economic domain,” Raoof Hasan, a special assistant to Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, told Reuters.

“Peace, both within and around with its neighbours, is a key constituent to facilitate that.”",804,4896,14,87

Biden reiterated that sentiment Thursday afternoon in brief remarks at the White House, describing the conversation between the two as “candid and respectful.” He added that the U.S. wanted to work with Russia where it could, but would not be afraid to stand up to the country when necessary. Biden said he also invited Putin to a potential summit this summer in Europe, a possibility their teams are currently discussing.

“I was clear with President Putin that we could have gone further, but I chose not to do so. I chose to be proportionate,” he said about the new actions. “The United States is not looking to kick off a cycle of escalation and conflict with Russia. We want a stable, predictable relationship.”

The Russian Foreign Ministry suggested that Biden was not sincere about any overtures to Moscow. “The US is not ready to put up with the objective reality of a #multipolar world,” it said in a tweet.

The new sanctions are sure to be met with approval by many U.S. lawmakers from both parties, although some are likely to say they do not go far enough. For example, based on the information released by the administration, there did not appear to be any penalties aimed at stopping the Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany, a step a number of Democrats and Republicans have urged.

In a statement, the White House characterized the administration's actions as intended “to impose costs on Russia for actions by its government and intelligence services against U.S. sovereignty and interests.”

None of the new actions against Russia announced on Thursday are specifically tied to reports that Russia placed bounties on U.S. and coalition troops in Afghanistan, the senior administration official told reporters, mostly because the intelligence community still only has low-moderate confidence in that assessment. Still, the official said, the U.S. has sent private messages to Russia through diplomatic and intelligence channels urging Kremlin officials to explain the bounties allegations, which the U.S. learned about primarily through detainee reporting.

“The information puts the burden on the Russian government to explain its actions,” the official said.

The U.S. decided to respond strongly, however, to the SolarWinds hack, which targeted dozens of federal and private entities in the U.S. The Treasury Department sanctioned technology companies and malicious cyber actors that the U.S. says have supported Russian Intelligence Services, and formally attributed the SolarWinds cyber attack to the SVR, Russia’s external intelligence agency. The U.S. deemed the intrusion, which compromised thousands of U.S. government and private sector networks, a national security concern.

“This is the start of a new U.S. campaign against Russian malign behavior,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement.

With regard to Russia’s actions in Ukraine, which still claims the Crimea region as its own, OFAC “designated five individuals and three entities” for sanctions. OFAC Director Andrea Gacki said in a statement that the designations would “impose additional costs on Russia for its forceful integration with Crimea and highlight the abuses that have taken place under Russia’s attempted annexation.”

Finally, under the authority of a new executive order signed by Biden on Thursday, the Treasury Department announced a series of punitive measures including “the implementation of new prohibitions on certain dealings in Russian sovereign debt, as well as targeted sanctions on technology companies that support the Russian Intelligence Services’ efforts to carry out malicious cyber activities against the United States.”

In a letter notifying Congress of his executive order, Biden wrote that his directive would declare “a national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by specified harmful foreign activities” of the Russian government.

Biden specifically cited Russia’s efforts to “undermine the conduct of “democratic elections and institutions in the U.S. and its allies, its “malicious cyber-enabled activities,” and its use of “transnational corruption to influence foreign governments.”

Other malign behavior mentioned by Biden included the targeting of dissidents and journalists outside Russia, the undermining of security in areas where the U.S. has national security interest, and the violation of international law.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement that the administration’s actions were intended to hold the Russian government to account” for its alleged SolarWinds espionage campaign, reported bounties on U.S. troops in Afghanistan and attempted interference in the 2020 election.

Blinken announced the State Department is expelling 10 officials from the Russian diplomatic mission in Washington, including personnel who are representatives of Russian intelligence services, according to the White House. Senior administration officials would not go into detail about how they selected which Russians to eject from the U.S., other than to say that their presence did not align with their supposed status in the U.S.

“These actions are intended to hold Russia to account for its reckless actions,” Blinken said. “We will act firmly in response to Russian actions that cause harm to us or our allies and partners. Where possible, the United States will also seek opportunities for cooperation with Russia, with the goal of building a more stable and predictable relationship consistent with U.S. interests.”

0,Unrelated patients have to share beds in Delhi hospital as India's COVID crisis spirals,https://www.jpost.com/international/two-to-a-bed-in-delhi-hospital-as-indias-covid-crisis-spirals-665248,"NEW DELHI - Many Indian hospitals were scrambling for beds and oxygen as COVID-19 infections surged to a new daily record on Thursday, with a second wave of infections centered on the rich western state of Maharashtra.

India's tally of total infections is second only to the United States, with experts blaming everything from official complacency to aggressive variants . The government has blamed failure to practice physical distancing.

The country has been producing oxygen at full capacity for each of the last two days but will have to turn to imports, with the health ministry saying it was planning to import 50,000 metric tons.

""The situation is horrible,"" said Avinash Gawande, an official at a government hospital in the industrial city of Nagpur that was battling a flood of patients, as were hospitals in neighboring Gujarat state and New Delhi in the north.

""We are a 900-bed hospital, but there are about 60 patients waiting and we don't have space for them.""

Maharashtra, home to the financial capital of Mumbai, began a lockdown at midnight on Wednesday, a move that spurred a rush to stockpile essential items in advance. The state, the country's most industrial, has been the worst affected by the pandemic.

At Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan (LNJP) Hospital in New Delhi, the country's largest facility treating COVID-19 patients, two or three patients were seen sharing single beds in some wards, a Reuters witness said.

COVID-positive patients - from a one-and-a-half-year-old toddler to many elderly - and their relatives kept streaming in to the emergency ward at LNJP, arriving by ambulance, car or auto-rickshaw throughout the day.

""Last year also we have not seen such a bad situation. This time the number is very high and increasing very rapidly, going (at a) very fast speed, so the situation is really alarming,"" said LNJP Medical Director Suresh Kumar.

""We are definitely overburdened... Today we have 158 admissions in Lok Nayak alone. All sick patients, all severe patients,"" Kumar added.

India has added 200,739 infections over the last 24 hours, health ministry data showed, for a seventh daily record surge in the last eight days, while 1,038 deaths took its toll to 173,123.

Despite injecting the third highest number of vaccines doses worldwide, India has covered only a small part of its 1.4 billion people.

India said on Thursday regulators would decide on emergency-use applications for foreign COVID-19 vaccines within three working days. India's ambassador to Moscow said deliveries of Russia's Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine to India were expected to begin before the end of April, the TASS news agency reported.

CURBS ORDERED IN NEW DELHI

In New Delhi, authorities ordered a weekend curfew, placing curbs on shopping malls, gyms, restaurants and some weekly markets.

Outside a major city mortuary, weeping relatives gathered in the hot sun, waiting for the bodies of loved ones to be released.

Forty-year-old Prashant Mehra said he had to pay a broker for preferential treatment before he could get his 90-year-old grandfather admitted to an overstretched government hospital.

""He died after six or seven hours,"" he said.

Supplies of oxygen ran short in places such as Gujarat, the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

""If such conditions persist, the death toll will rise,"" the head of a medical body in the industrial city of Ahmedabad told its chief minister in a letter.

Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries will supply 100 metric tonnes of additional oxygen to Maharashtra, a state minister said.

In the northern city of Haridwar, hundreds of thousands of pilgrims thronged to a Hindu religious festival on the banks of the river Ganges on Wednesday, stoking fears of a new surge.",610,3767,14,87

0,China to launch a pair of spacecraft towards the edge of the solar system,https://spacenews.com/china-to-launch-a-pair-of-spacecraft-towards-the-edge-of-the-solar-system/,"Chinese Voyager-like missions could launch in 2024, making planetary flybys before focusing on heliosphere science.

HELSINKI — China is developing a mission to send a pair of spacecraft to study the far reaches of the solar system and reach interstellar space by mid-century.

The project aims to send separate spacecraft to the nose and tail of the heliosphere, a region of space dominated by solar wind created by our Sun, to study distinct areas of this bubble and how it interacts with the interstellar medium.

Wu Weiren, a senior figure in China’s lunar exploration project, told official industry newspaper China Space News Friday that scientists are working on an implementation plan for the mission.

Wu says the mission aims to reach 100 astronomical units—one AU is equivalent to one Sun-Earth distance, or 150 million kilometers—from Earth by 2049, when the People’s Republic of China celebrates the centenary of its founding.

No launch date was provided by Wu. However an overview of the proposed mission presented to the European Planetary Science Congress in 2019 indicates the Chinese heliosphere probes would launch in 2024. The first would make a flyby of Jupiter in 2029 before heading to the nose of the heliosphere.

The second probe would make a flyby of Jupiter in 2033 before a flyby of ice giant Neptune in 2038. The spacecraft could also potentially release a small impactor probe shortly before arrival, with the main probe observing the interaction with the Neptunian atmosphere.

The project somewhat echoes NASA’s Voyager missions but the probes’ intermediate targets are constrained by current relative positions of the planets. The Voyagers made use of a rare planetary alignment to visit all four outer planets. Voyager 1 and 2 are now 22.7 and 18.9 billion kilometers (152 and 126 AU) away from Earth respectively.

For the Chinese probes more science focus is therefore on the heliosphere and interstellar medium, including studying phenomena such as Anomalous Cosmic Rays and the “hydrogen wall,” at the boundary of the solar system and interstellar space.

The Chinese heliosphere probes will take advantage of advances in propulsion and ground station and deep space communications made in recent years by China’s space industry. Such progress has recently facilitated missions to Mars, a lunar sample return and a planned mission to Jupiter.

China’s “Interstellar Express”

The mission profile above was understood to still be under development. A workshop hosted by the International Space Science Institute in Beijing in late 2019 explored the mission trade space and presented possibilities including a flyby of Kuiper Belt Object Quaoar and its small moon Weywot. The workshop also used the name “Interstellar Express” for the proposed Chinese mission.

A 2019 paper on “Exploring the solar system boundary” published in Scientia Sinica by Wu and other high profile Chinese scientists in space exploration provides insight into probable launch and spacecraft design.

The spacecraft will be powered by radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) with a science payload mass of greater than 50 kilograms. Long March 3B and larger Long March 5 rockets are under consideration for launch, depending on which propulsion systems—dual-mode chemical propulsion systems or monopropellant and ion-electric propulsion—are selected.

A further mission proposal noted in the paper would head away from the Sun perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic. That mission would launch in 2030 and be powered by a nuclear thermal reactor.

Achieving speeds of around 6 AU per year, the spacecraft could also target extreme Kuiper Belt Objects on its highly inclined trajectory. The technology maturity level for the mission is noted as low, thus requiring breakthroughs and verification.

The two 2024 Chinese missions would become the sixth and seventh spacecraft to achieve solar system escape velocity, following NASA’s Pioneer 10 and 11, Voyagers 1 and 2, and New Horizons.

Pioneer 10 is the only spacecraft to head towards the tail of the heliosphere. Communication with the spacecraft was lost in 2003 at a distance of 12 billion kilometers (80 AU) from Earth.

Scientists at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab are meanwhile studying the Interstellar Probe mission that could launch before 2030.

China recently approved a 14th Five-year plan for the period 2021-2026. Wu noted that missions for a fourth phase of Chinese lunar exploration, including a basic international lunar research station, would be carried out or developed during the period.

Wu added that the 2010 Chang’e-2 lunar orbiter, which later conducted a flyby of asteroid Toutatis, is expected to return to the vicinity of the earth around 2027.",747,4765,14,73

0,Covid patients' bodies pile up at Lucknow crematoriums as staff is ‘scared’ or visiting Kumbh,https://theprint.in/health/covid-patients-bodies-pile-up-at-lucknow-crematoriums-as-staff-is-scared-or-visiting-kumbh/639317/,"Text Size: A- A+

Lucknow: On Sunday, 11 April, Uttar Pradesh recorded its highest single-day spike since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic last year — registering 15,353 cases — and capital Lucknow was shown to have contributed around 27 per cent of them.

On 13 April, it emerged that the total number of Covid cases in Lucknow had gone up to 27,385 from 3,912 on 1 April — a jump of nearly 670 per cent — while the active case number for UP climbed to 95,980.

The state health department’s bulletin Monday showed that 72 Covid patients had died in UP in the preceding 24 hours (most of Sunday), of which 21 deaths were in Lucknow. The corresponding figures in Tuesday’s bulletin for the preceding 24 hours were 85 for the state and 18 for the city. However, Ajay Dwivedi, Lucknow’s municipal commissioner, told ThePrint that 69 bodies came to Lucknow’s crematoriums Sunday, leading to a long queue due to the shortage of staff.

Dwivedi said that while some staff are away at the Kumbh Mela, others have been “scared” to handle these bodies because of the bounce in infections.

“We were handling 7-8 cremations of Covid patients’ bodies on average per day (combined for the two crematoriums). But in the last one week, the number went up to 30 and then 40. Eventually, 69 bodies came for cremation Sunday. We were not prepared for this massive surge as some of our staff has gone to the Kumbh Mela. This is the reason that there was a long queue on the weekend at the cremation grounds,” he said.

‘Things being brought under control’

The rise of Covid deaths in Lucknow was underlined in a video that went viral Sunday, in which Lucknow DM Abhishek Prakash is seen talking to the doctors in a city hospital. “Increase ICUs, put people in isolation, do whatever is possible as you people are experts… Because now, people are dying on the roads,” he said in Hindi.

But Dwivedi assured that the administration had things under control now. “We have now employed 100 people who work in two shifts, day and night. We had already prepared 50 funeral pyres; the staff prepares them at night so there is no queue the next day. There have been no queues waiting Monday,” he claimed.

The commissioner added that wood for the pyres is being brought in on 10 trucks from the Sitapur Road, about 12 km outside the city, every day. “Looking at the numbers, we are preparing five electric crematoriums in the next 10 days, each of which can handle 8-10 bodies a day,” he added.

Yet, when ThePrint visited the two cremation grounds, Gulala Shamshan Ghat and Baikunth Dham, Monday afternoon, contrary to the commissioner’s claims, dozens of families were found waiting in the rising heat to perform the last rites of their loved ones. Almost every hour, a new body arrived for cremation.

Ajay Kumar, 33, whose uncle succumbed to the virus, was waiting, clueless, for his family’s turn. “My mausa ji (maternal aunt’s husband) was sick for a week. He complained of fever and cough, and died within one day of hospitalisation,” he said.

As families said their goodbyes to their loved ones, ghat employees continued to prepare new pyres. An employee at Gulala cremation ground said: “I have never seen a situation like this. I have seen more dead bodies in one week than my whole life.”

People reaching hospital in critical condition

The health machinery in the state capital is in a state of chaos, ThePrint’s visit to the King George’s Medical University, the main Covid facility, showed. A healthcare worker at KGMU said: “The last week has been horrible. People are coming in a critical condition and many of them aren’t surviving.”

Dr D.S. Negi, director-general of UP’s health department, told ThePrint: “This spike can be attributed to Holi when people came from all over the country to their hometowns. The general public’s attitude towards the virus has become too casual.”

Dr M.N. Siddiqi of Integral Medical College concurred. “People have started taking this virus lightly. Even if you go to the market, 50 per cent of the people don’t wear a mask. Healthcare workers are now getting infected in bulk. The second wave is more lethal as the jump in critical patients has gone up to 50 per cent.”

Most of the government and private hospitals in the city are full. But now many of these hospitals are turning their isolation wards into ICUs to accommodate critical patients, as people from neighbouring districts are also coming to Lucknow.

Yogi govt’s decisions

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath reviewed the Covid situation in the state and its capital Sunday, where he ordered the closure of all government and private schools till 30 April. The state government has also shut private coaching centres.

While I deeply believe in the Catholic virtue of mercy in my personal life, compassion has no place in my courtroom, and my long history as a federal judge demonstrates that. As soon as I put on my robes and step into my chambers, the Golden Rule all but ceases to exist.” Barrett added that her time as a clerk for Justice Scalia proved that she was capable of treating the poor as less than human beings in the eyes of the law.

0,Report: Iran is a Major Transit Point for the Global Meth Trade,https://www.occrp.org/en/daily/14235-report-iran-is-a-major-transit-point-for-the-global-meth-trade,"Iran’s role as a key node in the smuggling routes for methamphetamines from Central and South-East Asia to Europe has left the country with a significant drug problem, a recent EU report found.

More than 111 processing factories were shut down in the country in 2019 and 2020 alone, but several more are believed to still be in operation. (Source: Wikimedia Commons)“Iranian Drug Control Headquarters (DCHQ) reported that in 2019, an estimated 2.8 million Iranians (5.4 % of the adult population aged 15-65) were living with substance use disorders,” the report said.



Hundreds upon hundreds of tons of the drug have been seized by Iranian authorities as it has been passing through the country. It nevertheless keeps coming.

“Over the past decade, Iran is considered to have been an important source country of methamphetamine for domestic consumption and trafficking to external markets,” read the report.

While in recent years the drug is largely produced elsewhere, it is in Iran that it is processed into its final form and converted from liquid into crystalline form. More than 111 processing factories were shut down in the country in 2019 and 2020 alone, but several more are believed to still be in operation.

The U.S. withdrawal from the so-called “Iran Nuclear Deal” under the Trump administration hasn’t helped matters either. As international sanctions were re-imposed, the country’s economy has become more and more reliant on cross border smuggling especially by Kurdish couriers known as Kolbars. They ferry goods, both legal and illegal, through the mountainous region on Iran’s western border to Iraqi Kurdistan in exchange for essential supplies for their villages such as fuel and food.



“Given the reliance of the Iranian economy on cross-border smuggling and the reported transformative impact of smuggling on ethnic minorities in Iranian borderlands, it is likely that the country will continue to face challenges in its efforts to address the flow of drugs across its international borders,” the report said.",323,2040,12,63
0,Pakistan police file ‘blasphemy’ case against feminist marchers,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/16/pakistan-police-file-blasphemy-case-against-feminist-marchers,"Organisers of the annual Aurat Aazdi march on International Women’s Day condemn allegations as ‘baseless and false’.

Islamabad, Pakistan – Pakistani police have registered a blasphemy case against organisers of the feminist Aurat Azadi [Women’s Freedom] March in a northwestern city, while a court in the country’s second city dismissed the same charges as having no grounds.

Police in the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar registered the First Information Report (FIR) under the country’s strict blasphemy laws, which can carry a mandatory death penalty, on Thursday.

In a statement, organisers of the march, which is held annually to mark International Women’s Day on March 8, condemned the allegations as “baseless and false”.

“Since the March, women marchers have been met with countless death and rape threats including a leading newspaper, Daily Ummat, referring to [feminist] marchers as prostitutes and whores,” said the statement.

“These accusations and threats have now gone as far as falsely accusing us of blasphemy, an accusation that gravely endangers the lives of hundreds of women.”

Blasphemy is a sensitive subject in Pakistan, where the country’s strict laws mandate the death penalty for the crime of insulting Islam’s Prophet, and carry a life sentence for insulting Islam’s holy book, the Quran. The feminist organisers have been accused of the former offence.

In Lahore, a court dismissed a similar petition for being based on questionable video evidence and said the demonstrators’ right to protest was protected under constitutional protections for free speech.

Activists carry placards as they march during a rally to mark International Women’s Day in Lahore [File: Arif Ali/AFP] “The fact that the petitioner took offence from a vague slogan and labelled it as blasphemy reflects his own state of mind and pattern of thought,” read the order from Judge Hafiz Rizwan Aziz.

“He has alleged a very serious offence without any iota of supporting material.”

Allegations of blasphemy surfaced soon after this year’s march, appearing to be centered on doctored video and images. Organisers shared side-by-side comparisons of the original and doctored videos, the latter of which made it appear as if demonstrators were chanting against Allah.

“We are being incriminated for crimes we never committed, slogans that were never raised, and banners that were never carried,” said organisers in Thursday’s statement.

“Additionally, the incidents which are being falsely framed as blasphemous in these charges are not even from the Islamabad March and the allegations regarding them have been thoroughly debunked by both media outlets and the respective city chapters where they came up.”

Organisers said the blasphemy case was registered in Peshawar “to satisfy the bloodthirst of religious extremist vigilantes”.

This week, the far-right Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) party has held days of violent protests across Pakistan on the issue of blasphemy, demanding the French ambassador be expelled over comments by French President Emmanuel Macron last year that were perceived to be “blasphemous”.

Pakistan’s government on Thursday declared the TLP a “terrorist organisation” and cracked down on activists across the country, after at least two policemen were killed and more than 500 wounded in those protests.

The French government, meanwhile, has advised all French citizens and companies to temporarily leave Pakistan due to the security situation around the TLP’s protests.

0,U.S. has new intel that Manafort pal gave Trump campaign data to Russia,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/u-s-has-new-intel-manafort-friend-kilimnik-gave-trump-n1264371?cid=ed_npd_bn_tw_bn,"The U.S. intelligence community has developed new information about Konstantin Kilimnik, whom they call a Russian spy, that leads them to believe the associate of ex-Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort passed internal Trump campaign polling and strategy information to Russian intelligence services, two U.S. officials say.

On Thursday the U.S. Treasury sanctioned Kilimnik and for the first time said he passed along the data to Russian intelligence services.

That new detail, part of a factsheet released by Treasury, was not included in the 2019 report by special counsel Robert Mueller, who was tasked with investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

Mueller's team said in its report that Kilimnik was believed to “have ties to Russian intelligence,” and that Kilimnik had received the Trump campaign information from Manafort, but did not say what he did with it after receiving it.

A bipartisan report by the Senate Intelligence Committee in 2020 said coordination between the Trump campaign and a Russian operation to hack and leak Democratic emails may have existed through Kilimnik but could not be established with certainty. The report drew no conclusions about what the Russians ultimately did with the data.

The officials did not disclose when or how the U.S. came into possession of the new intelligence about Kilimnik, including whether or not the information was developed during the Trump or Biden administrations. The officials did not identify the source or type of intelligence that had been developed.

A spokesperson for the U.S. Treasury declined to comment.

In 2019, Mueller’s team authored a report that detailed the connection between Kilimnik and his former employer in Ukraine, Paul Manafort. Manafort was the Trump campaign chairman from the spring of 2016 until August 2016, when multiple press reports about his work in Ukraine and money he received there led to him stepping down. Manafort was working for the Trump campaign without pay.

Manafort was indicted by Mueller’s team and pleaded guilty in federal court to obstruction of justice and conspiracy. A judge found he had broken his plea agreement by lying to investigators on several issues, including his contacts with Kilimnik. He was convicted of additional charges in a separate case. He later received a presidential pardon from Trump.

According to Mueller, Manafort met with Kilimnik in New York on Aug. 2, 2016 and “months before that meeting, Manafort had caused internal polling data to be shared with Kilimnik, and the sharing continued for some period of time after their August meeting.”

Court documents show that some of that information was shared through former Manafort business partner and member of the Trump campaign, Rick Gates.

Ultimately, the Mueller report concluded, “because of questions about Manafort's credibility and our limited ability to gather evidence on what happened to the polling data after it was sent to Kilimnik, the Office could not assess what Kilimnik (or others he may have given it to) did with it.”

The Senate report released last August said Kilimnik is a Russian intelligence officer who may have had links to the hack-and-leak operation of the GRU, Russia's military intelligence agency, which hacked the emails of prominent Democrats and provided them to WikiLeaks in 2016.

The report includes three bulleted items that were redacted before release. The report says the redacted information ""suggests that a channel for coordination on the GRU hack-and-leak operation may have existed through Kilimnik, [but] the Committee had limited insight into Kilimnik's communications with Manafort and [REDACTED], all of whom used sophisticated communications security practices.""

So far, U.S. officials have not said publicly — or said if they know — what Russian intelligence services did with the data they received, or if the information provided had any impact on Russia’s attempts to interfere in the 2016 election.

0,Social media blocked in Pakistan | Likely a martial law test,https://www.dawn.com/news/1618552/social-media-blocked-in-pakistan-until-3pm-to-maintain-public-order,"The Ministry of Interior on Friday directed the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to temporarily block access to social media platforms — Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube and Telegram — from 11am to 3pm.

""It is requested that immediate action may be taken on the subject matter,"" the ministry directed the PTA chairman.

Shortly after, the PTA released an official statement saying: ""In order to maintain public order and safety, access to certain social media applications has been restricted temporarily.""

Following the interior ministry's directives, Nayatel — an internet service provider — said in a message to its customers that social media platforms had been blocked on the directions of the PTA.

A copy of the notification issued by the Ministry of Interior.

These platforms include Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, TikTok and Telegram. ""The inconvenience is regretted,"" it said.

After 3pm, users reported that the social media platforms had been partially restored.

The PTA too issued a statement saying ""access to social media applications has been restored.""

Although the notification issued by the interior ministry did not mention a reason for the suspension, the development comes after several days of unrest in the country due to protests by the recently proscribed Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP).

In a video message, Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid apologised to the public for the hours-long blockage of the applications, saying the government will ""try not to [restrict] social media in the future"".

He said the social media platforms were blocked because the TLP had issued a call to its activists to come out on the streets for protests after Friday prayers.

The minister said due to the government's efforts, ""the terrorists, agitators and those spreading unrest through social media have been defeated"".

Detained TLP chief Saad Rizvi, in a purported handwritten note shared by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Political Communication Shahbaz Gill late on Thursday, had urged his followers to maintain law and order and avoid blocking roads and highways.

In the letter, Rizvi had asked TLP supporters to peacefully go back to their homes and cooperate with law enforcement agencies.

However, some TLP supporters insisted they hear or see the words come from Rizvi himself before stopping.

Meanwhile, some rights activists criticised Friday's social media blackout, warning it could lead to more severe curbs on freedoms.

Editorial: A blanket ban on the TLP is a futile attempt to solve a complex problem

“These arbitrary decisions of blocking and banning have never done any good (and) instead opened ways to blanket bans,” said Nighat Dad, head of the Digital Rights Foundation on Twitter, shortly before the site became inaccessible.

Also on Friday, Sindh Police’s Counter-Terrorism Department initiated action against social media accounts allegedly operated by supporters and workers of the TLP, according to CTD Sindh chief Omar Shahid Hamid.

He said the action was being taken over a host of charges. “The CTD has initiated action against individuals who used social media to incite violence, spread hate and glorify the assaults on law enforcement personnel,” Hamid added.

He revealed that a list of TLP-related social media accounts had been identified and a complaint had been lodged with the FIA’s Cyber Crime Wing.

The CTD in its request to FIA said anti-state and hate speech material was being uploaded by TLP followers on social media platforms ""creating provocations and chaos across the country"".

Government bans TLP under anti-terrorism law

On Thursday, the government had slapped a ban on the TLP. A notification declaring TLP as a proscribed organisation was issued by the Ministry of Interior shortly after the federal cabinet approved a summary to ban the party.

The notification said: “The federal government has reasonable grounds to believe that the TLP is engaged in terrorism, [has] acted in a manner prejudicial to the peace and security of the country, [was] involved in creating anarchy in the country by intimidating the public, caused grievous bodily harm, hurt and death to the personnel of law enforcement agencies and innocent by-standers, attacked civilians and officials, created wide-scale hurdles, threatened, abused and promoted hatred, vandalised and ransacked public and government properties including vehicles and caused arson, blocked essential health supplies to hospitals, and has threatened, coerced, intimidated, and overawed the government [and] the public and created sense of fear and insecurity in the society and the public at large.""

Copies of the notification were sent to authorities concerned, including the secretaries of different ministries and divisions, State Bank governor, Election Commission of Pakistan secretary and director general passports.

The National Counter Terrorism Authority had also swiftly added the TLP to the list of banned terrorist organisations taking the total number of such outfits to 79.

In an effort to keep the ulema in the loop, the religious affairs minister had also hosted an Iftar-dinner in the honour of religious scholars where Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed had briefed them on the reasons for banning the TLP.

0,These animals went extinct in the wild. Scientists brought them back,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/16/world/animal-reintroduction-extinct-wild-c2e-hnk-spc-intl-scn/index.html,"All of them went extinct in the wild -- and all of them came back, thanks to reintroduction programs.

Conservation scientists use translocation and captive breeding to re-establish animal populations that have died out in the wild -- either entirely or in certain areas. Reintroducing extinct-in-the-wild animals to their native territories can be a double win: helping to restore degraded ecosystems, as well as increasing population numbers.

But setting a species loose in the wild is a precarious balancing act. Reintroductions often take years and involve multiple phases, says Natasha Robinson, an ecologist at the Australian National University who specializes in threatened wildlife.

One of the most iconic reintroduction success stories, Przewalski's horse went extinct in the wild in the 1960s, but were returned to the Mongolian steppe in 1992.

Before bringing back a species, conservationists have to evaluate the threat level -- both to and from the animal -- and the role it played in the ecosystem, says Robinson. In places where wild populations have died out more recently, there's a better chance of success, she says.

""The less time that has passed, the more likely that environment is the same as when the species went extinct,"" she says. ""But you still need to address the reason why it went extinct in that environment to begin with.""

Reintroduced animals can have a positive impact on the landscape, but how fast this happens depends on the type of animal and how damaged the environment is. Herbivores can make a significant change relatively quickly, says Robinson: for example, bandicoots, a small shrew-like marsupial, dig and redistribute flammable ""fuel loads"" like dry leaves which can reduce the risk of bushfires, as well as increasing soil turnover and improving seedling growth.

Hunted for its meat, hide and horns, the Arabian oryx disappeared from the wild in the 1970s but has since been reintroduced in Israel, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.

Predators tend to be reintroduced slowly and carefully. While they can be useful for managing pest species, conservationists have to ensure they don't overhunt or threaten other vulnerable animals, says Robinson.

2020 study highlighted species reintroduction as one of the most effective ways to save endangered animals. Without these projects, species such as Przewalski's horse and the Guam rail would almost certainly be extinct in the wild. The study estimates that conservation action between 1993 and 2020 saved up to 48 species of birds and mammals from extinction, and that the rate of extinction would have been three to four times higher, during that period, without those efforts.

China's economic recovery quickened sharply in the first quarter to record growth of 18.3% from last year's deep coronavirus slump, propelled by stronger demand at home and abroad and continued government support for smaller firms.

But the brisk expansion, heavily skewed by the plunge in activity a year earlier, is expected to moderate later this year as the government turns its attention to reining in financial risks in overheating parts of the economy.

While the jump in gross domestic product (GDP) undershot the 19% forecast by economists in a Reuters poll, the official data showed it was the fastest growth since quarterly records began in 1992 and up from 6.5% in the fourth quarter last year.

""The upshot is that with the economy already above its pre-virus trend and policy support being withdrawn, China's post-COVID rebound is levelling off,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior china economist at Capital Economics. ""We expect quarter-on-quarter growth to remain modest during the rest of this year as the recent boom in construction and exports unwinds, pulling activity back towards trend.""

Aided by strict virus containment measures and emergency relief for businesses, the economy has recovered from a steep 6.8% slump in the first three months of 2020, when an outbreak of COVID-19 in the central city of Wuhan rapidly became a crippling pandemic that has killed about 3 million worldwide.

China's rebound has been led by exports as factories raced to fill overseas orders and more recently a steady pickup in consumption as shoppers returned to restaurants, malls and car dealerships. read more

Retail sales increased 34.2% year-on-year in March, beating a 28.0% gain expected by analysts and stronger than the 33.8% jump seen in the first two months of the year.

Other data, however, showed a moderation in expansion with quarter-on-quarter growth slowing to 0.6% in January-March from a revised 3.2% in the previous quarter, missing expectations for a 1.5% increase.

Factory output grew 14.1% year-on-year in March, slowing from a 35.1% surge in the January-February period and lagging a forecast 17.2% rise.

SLOWDOWN EXPECTED

National Bureau of Statistics spokeswoman Liu Aihua told a news conference on Friday while the economy started 2021 on a firm footing, the services sector and smaller firms still faced challenges, while consumer inflation was likely to remain moderate.

Data last week showed consumer prices rising at only a modest pace in March, even as factory gate inflation hit a near three-year high. read more

""Looking forward, the trend of normalisation may continue for the rest of the year, and domestic consumption is expected to be the major growth driver,"" said Chaoping Zhu, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management in Shanghai.

""In terms of policy response, the central bank and fiscal authorities are returning to a more neutral stance, although some selective measures might be continued in order to support the small and medium-sized enterprises.""

Li Wei, economist at Standard Chartered in Shanghai, expected second-quarter growth to slow to 7%.

FOCUS ON RISKS

The world's second-largest economy is expected to grow 8.6% in 2021, according to a Reuters poll, which would easily beat the government's 2021 annual growth target of above 6%. read more

China's GDP grew just 2.3% rise last year, its weakest expansion in 44 years but still making it the only major economy to avoid contraction as other industrial powers struggled with the pandemic hit.

With the economy back on a more solid footing, China's central bank is turning its focus to cooling credit growth to help contain financial risks.

However, it is treading cautiously to avoid derailing the recovery with policymakers vowing not to make any sudden policy shifts.

Authorities are especially concerned about financial risks involving the country's overheated property market and have asked banks to trim their loan books this year to guard against asset bubbles. read more

Separate data on Friday showed new home prices in China rising at the fastest pace in seven months in March, with gains spreading to more cities as red-hot demand defied government efforts to cool the market.

0,Top Ethiopia health official alleges ‘sexual slavery’ in Tigray: Eleven women tell Reuters they had been raped by soldiers as a top Ethiopian official has made a sexual slavery accusation.,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/15/health-official-alleges-sexual-slavery-in-tigray-report,"Eleven women tell Reuters they had been raped by soldiers as a top Ethiopian official has made a sexual slavery accusation.

A young mother was trying to get home with food for her two children when she says soldiers pulled her off a minibus in Ethiopia’s Tigray region, claiming it was overloaded.

It was the beginning of an 11-day ordeal in February, during which she says she was repeatedly raped by 23 soldiers who forced nails, rock and other items into her vagina, and threatened her with a knife.

Doctors showed Reuters news agency the bloodstained stone and two 3 inches (7.6cm) nails they said they had removed from her body.

The woman, 27, is among hundreds who have reported that they were subjected to horrific sexual violence by Ethiopian and allied Eritrean soldiers after fighting broke out in November in the mountainous northern region of Ethiopia, doctors said.

Some women were held captive for extended periods, days or weeks at a time, said Dr Fasika Amdeselassie, the top public health official for the government-appointed interim administration in Tigray.

“Women are being kept in sexual slavery,” Fasika told Reuters. “The perpetrators have to be investigated.”

Reports of rape have been circulating for months. But Fasika’s assertion, based on women’s accounts, marks the first time an Ethiopian official – in this case, a top regional health officer – has made a sexual slavery accusation in connection with the conflict in Tigray.

In addition, eight other doctors at five public hospitals told Reuters that most of the rape victims described their attackers as either Ethiopian government soldiers or Eritrean troops. It was more common for women to report sexual violence by Eritrean soldiers, the doctors said.

The Eritreans have been helping Ethiopia’s central government fight the region’s former ruling party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), in the conflict plaguing the Horn of Africa nation.

Taken together, the descriptions paint the most detailed picture to date of the sexual violence against women in Tigray and the military’s alleged involvement in it.

Most people interviewed for this article declined to be identified. They said they feared reprisals, including possible violence, by soldiers who guard the hospitals and towns.

Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed acknowledged in a speech to parliament on March 23 that “atrocities were being committed by raping women” and promised that the perpetrators would be punished. He did not identify the alleged perpetrators.

He said then for the first time that Eritrean soldiers had entered the conflict in Tigray in support of the Ethiopian government after the TPLF attacked military bases across the region in the early hours of November 4.

Ethiopia’s government had previously denied this, and the Eritrean government still does not acknowledge their troops’ presence. The TPLF was the dominant power in the central government when Eritrea fought a bloody border war with Ethiopia a generation ago.

Neither the Ethiopian nor the Eritrean governments responded to questions from Reuters about specific cases raised by women and their doctors, or about the accusation of sexual slavery.

No charges have been announced by civilian or military prosecutors against any soldiers. However, officials in both countries emphasised that their governments have zero tolerance for sexual violence – a point Abiy’s spokeswoman, Billene Seyoum, said the prime minister reiterated recently in discussions with military leaders.

The alleged sexual violence has drawn international attention.

Billene said the United Nations, the African Union and Ethiopia’s state-appointed human rights commission have been authorised to carry out joint investigations into alleged abuses by all sides in the conflict. That includes the “criminal clique”, she said, referring to the TPLF.

An Ethiopian military spokesman and the head of a government task force on the Tigray crisis did not respond to phone calls and text messages seeking comment. Reuters could not reach military leaders in either country.

Asked about the reports that Eritrean troops have committed rapes in Tigray and are keeping women in sexual slavery, the country’s Information Minister Yemane Gebremeskel accused TPLF activists of “coaching ‘sympathisers’ to create false testimonies”.

“All the fabricated stories – which are alien to our culture and laws – are peddled to cover up the crimes of the TPLF which started the war,” he told Reuters in a written response.

Reuters was unable to reach a TPLF spokesman.

Records of abuse

Fasika, the health official, said at least 829 cases of sexual assault have been reported at the five hospitals since the conflict in Tigray began.

Those cases were likely “the tip of the iceberg”, Fasika said. Rape is underreported in Ethiopia because it carries a huge stigma. Also, most of the region’s health facilities are no longer functioning, and travel between towns remains dangerous, he said.

Most of the women who have come forward are either pregnant or sustained severe physical injury from the rapes, Fasika said.

Reuters interviewed 11 women who said they had been raped by soldiers from Eritrea, Ethiopia or both. Four said they were kidnapped, taken to military camps and gangraped, in some cases alongside other women. The women did not know the camp names but said they were located near Mekelle and the towns of Idaga Hamus, Wukro and Sheraro.

Five other women said they were held in fields or deserted houses for up to six days. And two said they were raped in their own homes.

Reuters could not independently verify their accounts. However, all told similar stories of being beaten and brutalised.

Healthcare providers confirmed that the 11 women’s injuries were consistent with the events they described, and they showed Reuters medical records for three of the women detailing their conditions.

The healthcare providers also shared details of nine other cases of sexual assault, including the ordeals of two 14-year-old girls.

Although Ethiopia’s government declared victory over the TPLF in November, fighting continues in some areas, and medical workers say new rapes are reported at the region’s health facilities every day.

“This is being done to dishonour the women, to break their pride,” said a doctor at Ayder Referral Hospital, in Mekelle, citing the brutality of the attacks and humiliation of victims. “This is not for sexual gratification. The rapes are to punish Tigray.”

‘Tell my story’

The 27-year-old mother said uniformed soldiers from Eritrea pulled her off a minibus on the road from Mekelle to the city of Adigrat on February 6.

They tied her up and marched her through fields to a bush camp, she said. After 11 days of rapes and beatings, she said, the soldiers forced nails, cotton, plastic bags and rock into her vagina and left her alone in the bush.

Villagers found her unconscious and brought her to a nearby hospital.

She said she was still bleeding from severe internal injuries and could not control her urine, walk without a crutch or sit up for long periods. One leg was broken, she said.

She also described a different kind of pain. While in the hospital, she has no way to speak to her four-year-old son and six-year-old daughter because the Eritrean soldiers took her mobile phone. She had left the children with her mother to search for food and never returned. At the time, the family had less than a week’s worth of bread.

“I don’t know anything if they are dead or alive,” she said. “The enemy destroyed my life.”

A 32-year-old mother in Mekelle told Reuters that soldiers removed her from a minibus on the same road at the end of February.

They were dressed in Ethiopian uniforms, she said, but spoke with an Eritrean accent and had traditional facial scarification typical of the neighbouring country.

She said they shot her 12-year-old son dead in front of her, then took her to a camp where she was held with other female captives and repeatedly raped for 10 days.

“Tell my story,” she said. “This is happening to women out there right now. I want this to end with me.”

A 28-year-old house cleaner said soldiers grabbed her from a street in Mekelle on the afternoon of February 10 and took her to a field outside a military base where she was raped by more than 10 men wearing Ethiopian or Eritrean uniforms.

Wiping away tears, she said that during her two-week ordeal, soldiers doused her with alcohol and mocked her as they assaulted her. She escaped when her captors were distracted by gunfire, she said.

Shot for resisting

The government has set up a task force separate from the human rights commission to investigate the reports of sexual violence. Its head, Mebrihit Assefa, said the body includes representatives from the regional health bureau, the attorney general’s office and federal police.

The task force plans to set up five centres where rape survivors can file reports with law enforcement and receive medical and psychosocial support.

“Our prosecutors [and] police officers are there to investigate all crimes committed, including sexual violence,” said Awol Sultan, a spokesman for the attorney general’s office.

He did not respond to questions about the women alleging they were raped during captivity, or whether prosecutors were in touch with either the Eritrean or Ethiopian militaries. The results of the criminal investigations will be made public at an unspecified date, he said.

Abera Nigus, the head of Tigray’s justice bureau, said the legal process was likely to be complicated because most courts are not functioning in Tigray, and many rape victims cannot identify their assailants.

Knowing their rapists are still at large has also discouraged women from seeking help, doctors said.

Many of the women who sought treatment at hospitals had vaginal and anal tears, sexually transmitted diseases and injuries that rendered them incontinent, said the Ayder hospital doctor, an obstetrician-gynaecologist. The doctor shared notes from 11 cases the hospital had treated involving women raped by soldiers.

One woman had been gangraped on three separate occasions, according to the hospital notes.

Another was five months pregnant when she was raped, the notes indicate. Two 14-year-old girls were sexually assaulted in front of their families. One girl had a hand and foot amputated.

She had been shot for resisting her assailant.",1686,10457,30,188
0,Ukraine still outgunned as Russia prepares for larger conflict,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/14/ukraine-still-outgunned-as-russia-prepares-for-larger-conflict,"Russia’s unexplained buildup along Ukraine’s border set alarm bells ringing in the west last month as military analysts noted unusual flourishes – such as new field hospitals, long-distance shipments of armour and artillery and last-minute railcar bookings – that did not feel like a normal exercise.

Whether it is merely an attention-grabbing feint or a prelude to an escalation will depend on the Kremlin’s will. But through the buildup, Russia has already signalled that if a larger war does take place, it is prepared to deliver a hammer blow to its neighbour.

“My take is that all the signalling from Russia’s side is that the next war with Ukraine will be a much larger one … and that it will result in a much larger defeat in terms of Ukrainian force. That’s at least what they’re posturing,” said Michael Kofman, a senior researcher at CNA, referring to the troop buildup and rhetoric from Kremlin officials. At least so far, he said, Russia was making its buildup “very easy to see and find”.

The message has reached US and Nato officials, who have reaffirmed their support for Kyiv and called on Russia to de-escalate tensions. Joe Biden has proposed holding a presidential summit with Vladimir Putin. The foreign ministers of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia are expected to visit the conflict zone on Thursday.

Ever since the outbreak of war in 2014, the militaries of Ukraine and Russia have been preparing their troops for a larger conflict. Over those years, Russia’s ground forces have modernised considerably, seeing combat in Ukraine and Syria and deploying permanently along the border.

Ukraine, too, has retooled its military, which has fought a grinding war in the country’s east for seven years, boosting defence spending and seeking to recruit international support to ward off an aggressive neighbour with far greater resources.

“I would say that we have done the absolute best, or at least very well, that we could based on the funding and constraints we had,” said Mykola Bielieskov, a Kyiv-based military analyst, noting significant “quantitative improvements” in terms of building up numbers of troops, artillery, air defence systems and operational aircraft.

That buildup has had its limits in terms of acquiring unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and secure communications equipment and modernising battle tanks, he said, but there has been much better maintenance of existing stock than up to 2014. “What has changed is we now maintain the Soviet heritage much better than we had,” he said.

At the outbreak of the 2014 war, Ukraine’s military was barely in a position to fight a war. The vast majority of its troops seemed unable to carry out orders, and much of its equipment, including armour and aircraft, was not battle-ready. In the early stages of the conflict, volunteer battalions filled out the ranks on the frontlines. “The army was in tatters – in freefall, I would say. A couple more years of this and the army would have been nonexistent,” said Bielieskov.

Since then, defence spending in Ukraine has increased from $1.9bn to more than $4.7bn, allowing Ukraine to build up to 38 line and artillery brigades. Much of the investment has gone into artillery, he noted, after battles in 2014-15 showed that the Ukrainian military was outgunned by Russia’s UAV-guided long-range fire, which caused up to 80% of the casualties among Ukrainian fighters. Combat experience and training have also improved across the armed forces and the officer corps. A former diplomat in Kyiv called it a “major overhaul”.

Still, Russia maintains a larger and more advanced military force (its military spending is 10 times greater in dollar terms), and in the case of an all-out invasion it would probably use different tactics, launching attacks using air power, special forces and paratroopers, and electronic warfare, cutting a potential defence down to a period of weeks, Bielieskov estimated. In a worst-case scenario, Ukrainian military planners still may hope to raise the cost of an invasion, including the potential for urban and guerrilla warfare, to make it far less palatable for Moscow.

“It’s likely about making Russia pay the highest price using our regular forces and then starting this kind of campaign of resistance,” said Bielieskov.

Ukraine has turned its army into an effective force in Donbas, where it has had to invest considerable resources and would be best suited to hold the line against a larger Russian force.

But analysts say it would be put at a disadvantage if it had to turn to face an invading force on two fronts, potentially coming from Crimea and from the north, where Russia has established a base just 150 miles from the border, with tanks, rocket artillery and even short-range ballistic missiles.

“The Russian military is in a very different place than it was in 2014-15,” said Kofman, noting a “tremendous level of modernisation”, training, combat experience, upgraded kit and the new deployment of tactical formations along the Ukrainian border, as well as expanded logistical capacity. “They’re not going to repeat the contest that they had.”

Moscow would probably seek a “short and sharp” conflict, Kofman said, avoiding a grinding war for territory and minimising the importance of Ukraine’s large operational reserves.

“Realistically, they’re still tremendously both outgunned and outnumbered,” he said.",872,5383,9,62

They don’t give a Nobel Peace Prize for swimming every year, but they do when they see someone who really deserves it.

In view of the rising Covid cases in the country, the Union Culture Ministry has decided to shut down the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort, Fatehpur Sikri, and other Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) protected monuments with immediate effect.

The news of the Taj Mahal's closure has disappointed the tourists who had arrived in Agra to view the world-famous monument.

Earlier, the Taj Mahal had remained closed for 188 days during the first wave of the pandemic and in the second wave too. The tentative reopening date of the monument is 15th May, but if the case count continues to increase in the country, the authorities may move up the date.

Talking to India Today, Agra Tourist Welfare Chamber secretary Vishal Sharma said that the monument's closure was being anticipated for the past few days, after the number of tourists arriving at the Taj Mahal had dropped by almost 75 percent, from 13-15 thousand per day, to barely 3-4 thousand this week.

Following the announcement on Wednesday of night curfew in Agra, the number of tourists had gone down to 2,706.

Vishal Sharma said that the Taj Mahal's closure last year from 17th March to 21st September had dealt a huge blow to the tourism industry of Agra and it was just slowly getting back on its feet. Sharma added that this time a lot of tourism-related businesses in Agra could be forced to shut down for good.

Vishal Sharma pointed out that a lot of tourism businesses, especially handicraft emporiums and travel agencies are facing tough times, having been forced to remain closed for over one year. With the second wave of Covid-19 gaining momentum, many businesses may have to finally let go of their staff, which they had been retaining in the hopes of revival of business this year.

0,Elon Musk’s SpaceX wins contract to develop spacecraft to land astronauts on the moon,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/16/nasa-lunar-lander-contract-spacex/,"In winning the $2.9 billion contract, SpaceX beat out Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin, which had formed what it called a “national team” by partnering with aerospace giants Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper. SpaceX also won over Dynetics, a defense contractor based in Huntsville, Ala. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

Story continues below advertisement

NASA had originally chosen all three companies for the initial phase of the contract, and was expected to choose two of them to build the lunar lander. In other major programs, NASA has chosen multiple providers to foster competition and to ensure it has redundancy in case one can’t deliver.

In a document explaining NASA’s rationale for picking SpaceX obtained by The Washington Post, NASA said it wanted “to preserve a competitive environment at this stage of the HLS Program.” But it added that “NASA’s current fiscal year budget did not support even a single [contract] award.” As a result, SpaceX updated its payment schedule so that it now fits “within NASA’s current budget.”

But in moving ahead with SpaceX alone, it sent a message that it fully trusts the growing company to fly its astronauts for its signature human exploration program — Artemis, a campaign to return astronauts to the moon for the first time since 1972.

Story continues below advertisement

“As the first human lunar lander in 50 years, this innovative human landing system will be a hallmark in space exploration history,” Lisa Watson-Morgan, NASA’s lunar lander program manager, said during a news briefing announcing the award. “NASA’s Apollo program captured the world’s attention, demonstrated the power of America’s vision and technology, and can-do spirit. And we expect Artemis will similarly inspire great achievements, innovation and scientific discoveries. We’re confident in NASA’s partnership with SpaceX to help us achieve the Artemis mission.”

Over the past several years, SpaceX, founded by Musk in 2002 with the goal of eventually flying humans to Mars, has completely upended the space industry, moving through fast, and at times fiery test campaigns that have unsettled traditional industry officials but also ignited new waves of enthusiasm not seen since the early days of the Space Age.

When Musk first started the company, even he didn’t think it would succeed. In 2008, after three test flights of its Falcon 1 rocket failed to reach orbit, he was nearly out of money. But the next test was successful, and NASA awarded the company a modest contract that kept it afloat.

Story continues below advertisement

In the years since, SpaceX has flown cargo and supplies to the International Space Station, and then, astronauts, overcoming skeptics who said human spaceflight should never be outsourced to the private sector, and certainly not to a company as green — and brash — as SpaceX.

In 2015, one of its Falcon 9 rockets exploded on a mission for NASA flying cargo to the station. Another exploded on the launchpad ahead of an engine test in 2016. And after Musk smoked pot on a podcast broadcast on the Internet, then-NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine ordered a safety review of the entire company.

But despite the setbacks, SpaceX has achieved enormous success — flying astronauts safely and dominating the launch market, while lowering the cost and dramatically increasing the number of flights.

For the Artemis program, SpaceX bid its reusable Starship spacecraft, which is being designed to fly large numbers of people into deep space and land on celestial bodies as well as back on Earth.

On Twitter, the company said it is “humbled to help @NASAArtemis usher in a new era of human space exploration.” In a statement, Blue Origin said its “National Team doesn’t have very much information yet. We are looking to learn more about the selection.” Dynetics did not respond to requests for comment.

The company has been putting its Starship spacecraft through a fast-paced test campaign at its facility in South Texas, launching prototypes without any people on board several miles up in the air, then flying them back to a landing site.

So far, all the test vehicles have crash-landed in a series of fireballs that triggered investigations overseen by the Federal Aviation Administration. But the company is expected to try again soon with a test vehicle that Musk has said is outfitted with several upgrades. And it hopes to be able to fly the spacecraft to orbit this year.

SpaceX was one of two providers hired by NASA to fly its astronauts to the International Space Station. It flew two missions with astronauts last year and its next mission scheduled to launch on Thursday. Boeing, the other company hired to ferry crews to the station and back, has stumbled badly and has yet to fly a test mission with astronauts.

That experience shows why NASA is best served by having at least two providers on major programs, officials said, and the pressure will be on SpaceX to perform. According to the document explaining the decision, SpaceX’s bid “was the lowest among the offerors by a wide margin.” NASA also liked Starship’s ability to ferry a lot of cargo to and from the surface of the moon as well, which it said “has the potential to greatly improve scientific operations.”

While the contract will cover the first human landing, Watson-Morgan said NASA “will also begin work immediately on a follow-up competition” to “provide regularly recurring services to the lunar surface that will enable these crewed missions on sustainable basis.”

The Artemis program began under the administration of former president Donald Trump but has been embraced by the Biden administration, though the White House is reconsidering the timeline. Trump had ordered that astronauts land on the moon by 2024, a schedule the White House now says is under review as NASA works to develop its rockets and spacecraft. It is also working with Congress to get the funding it needs.

For this fiscal year, Congress appropriated $850 million for the effort — well short of the $3.3 billion NASA said it needed to meet the 2024 timeline.

Earlier this month, the Biden administration proposed a $24.7 billion budget for NASA, a 6.3 percent increase that included an additional $325 million for the Artemis program.

Acting NASA Administrator Steve Jurczyk praised the request and said it “supports the development of capabilities for sustainable, long-duration human exploration beyond Earth, and eventually to Mars.”

Previously NASA vowed that it would land a woman on the moon as part of the first Artemis lunar landing. But in his statement, Jurczyk said the agency would also include the “first person of color” as part of the program.

The White House recently nominated former Florida Sen. Bill Nelson (D) to lead the agency. His confirmation hearing is scheduled for next week, and he is expected to win confirmation easily. During his time in Congress, Nelson was a strong advocate for space exploration, and he flew on the space shuttle in 1986 as a member of the House. If confirmed, he has said he would push to get the funding the Artemis program needs, as the agency reassesses the timeline for returning astronauts to the moon.

Also on Friday, the White House said it would nominate former NASA astronaut Pamela Melroy, a retired Air Force colonel, to be the space agency’s deputy administrator.

The contracts for the lunar landers come a year after NASA awarded three initial contracts to Blue Origin, Dynetics and SpaceX.

In awarding those contracts, NASA said Blue Origin and its team was furthest along and awarded it the largest contract, $579 million. Dynetics, which is partnering with the Sierra Nevada Corp., received $253 million, and SpaceX won $135 million.

The defeat is a huge blow Blue Origin, and to Bezos, who has long been fascinated by the moon and has for years wanted to be part of the effort to return there. He has said that watching Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walk on the moon when he was 5 years old was “a seminal moment” for him.",1375,8449,14,85

In a press conference early Thursday morning, the Japanese console maker ushered in the end of an era with the bittersweet announcement that they will stop production of the PlayStation 5.

Wow, gamers. We knew something like this might be coming, but that doesn’t make it any less painful to know that this historic period in video game history is finally coming to a close.



“It was a wild ride, but all good things must come to an end,” said a visibly emotional Sony CEO Kenichiro Yoshida, pausing several times to collect himself while announcing the momentous decision to cease manufacturing the console. “We want to thank the designers and the game makers. But most of all we want to thank the fans for everything they did to make this the most incredible three months in our company’s history.”

“It was our privilege to bring the PlayStation 5 into your homes,” he concluded.



For fans of the iconic console, the decision—effective immediately—is an emotional moment that reveals exactly how far we’ve come since the console’s launch way back on November 12, 2020. In fact, there’s so much to remember, it’s hard to even know where to begin. Most will think back on the unforgettable times they spent with titles ranging from 2020's Astro’s Playroom to the Nioh 2 Remastered, also released in 2020. For us, though? Our nostalgia knobs will always be turned up to eleven just remembering last year’s cross-generation release of Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla.

Of course, it’s better to go out on top than for people to grow tired of you, and we wish Sony all the best on their farewell tour selling off their last backstock of consoles. And as much as we wish the PS5 could last forever, we prefer this to the sad spectacle of watching Microsoft trying to wring a few more months out of the doddering Xbox Series X.

We, for one, are glad to see Sony taking the classy way out. And though they might be closing the book on one of the most notable epochs in video games history, we can’t wait to see what they’re up to next!

We’ve seen some pretty unprofessional behavior before in the gaming industry, but this really takes the cake. There is a whole line of playable demo stations for Cyberpunk 2077 at the Onion Gamer Expo right now, but the reps from CD Projekt Red have been hogging every single one of them this whole time even though it’s their own game.

Look, we’re just going to say it: This is total bullshit.

After a week of exclusive previews and gameplay teasers, we were unbelievably pumped to finally get our hands on CD Projekt Red’s sprawling new science-fiction RPG. Unfortunately, just as we were about to grab a controller to jump into the neon-lit wonder of Night City, a dozen Projekt Red employees barged through the door, commandeered every single one of the controllers, and haven’t stopped playing for the past 30 minutes. They didn’t even seem to care that there was a massive line of fans who had been waiting for hours to catch a glimpse of the new perk trees and stealth mechanics over their shoulders. Goddamnit.

What’s worse is that we have repeatedly and respectfully asked their designers and coders to step aside and let someone else play, stressing that they must have playtested the game thousands of times by now over the five-year development cycle. But they just either outright ignored us or laughed in our face! It’s unbelievable. There are signs mounted everywhere that say “Limit 15 Minutes”—signs that they mounted themselves—and these pricks don’t even seem to care.

Jesus Christ, one of them just quit out of the game entirely so she could boot up Celeste. That’s not what this booth is for, you jerks! C’mon!

Well, we are calling it, this is fucking unacceptable, gamers. This is our expo and we want to play Cyberpunk, or at least watch it without Mike Pondsmith deliberately obstructing our view. If CD Projekt Red wants to thumb their noses at the rules and act like a bunch of spoiled assholes, they will pay the price. We’re calling the expo manager to get these assholes off the consoles and let everyone else gets a chance.

And by the way CD Projekt? We are panning the shit out of your game if you ever actually manage to release it.",385,2213,30,176

Oslo (AFP)

Norway's main opposition Labour Party on Friday rejected a government plan to decriminalise the personal use of drugs in small quantities, saying the measure could incite young people to experiment with narcotics.

Under the centre-right coalition government's proposal submitted in February, both the possession and use of small quantities of drugs, including heroin, cocaine and cannabis, would no longer have been punishable under the criminal code, but users would still have had to seek help.

The ruling party however needed backing from the opposition in parliament in order for the bill to be approved.

Although the Labour Party is in principal in favour of doing away with penalties for heavy drug users, it is against decriminalising drug use for the wider population.

Proponents of the bill argued that criminal prosecution of drug users can be counterproductive as it deters those with abuse problems from seeking help, makes it more difficult for relatives to detect problems and stigmatises an already vulnerable demographic.

Although the bill was rejected on Friday, negotiations could still lead to a different text decriminalising heavy drug use being adopted.

Despite having one of the highest living standards in Europe, Norway -- and other Nordic countries -- have seen higher numbers of drug-related deaths per capita than the rest of Europe.

In recent years, 260 people have died annually from a drug overdose in Norway, according to a report published last year by the Norwegian Directorate of Health.

0,Ukraine may seek nuclear weapons if left out of NATO: Diplomat,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/16/ukraine-may-seek-nuclear-weapons-if-left-out-of-nato-diplomat,"A Ukrainian diplomat has reportedly warned Kyiv may be forced to acquire nuclear weapons to safeguard the country’s security if NATO does not accede to its membership demand amid spiralling tensions with neighbouring Russia.

Andriy Melnyk, Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany, suggested to national public radio network Deutschlandfunk on Thursday that President Volodymyr Zelensky’s administration was weighing up all possible options as fears mount over a possible escalation of hostilities in the country’s conflict-stricken east.

“Either we are part of an alliance like NATO and also make our contribution to strengthen this Europe, or we have only one option; to rearm ourselves,” Germany’s DPA news agency quoted Melnyk as saying. “How else could we guarantee our defence?”

His comments came after intensified fighting in recent weeks in Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions, where government forces have battled Russian-backed separatists since the rebels seized a swath of territory there in April 2014.

Meanwhile, Russia has amassed tens of thousands of troops as well as tanks and artillery near the shared border in the region. Moscow has also mobilised troops in the annexed Black Sea region of Crimea, which it annexed from Ukraine in March 2014.

Kyiv’s NATO push

Ukraine is currently an ally of NATO, but not a member. It has sought to launch accession talks for years but has consistently been turned down.

The issue has acquired renewed urgency of late as a result of the stand-off with Moscow.

Earlier this month, Kyiv called for its entry into the alliance to be fast-tracked, saying it was the only way to end the conflict in the Donbas region, of which Donetsk and Luhansk are a part.

Moscow opposes Kyiv’s ascension bid and has accused NATO and leading member the United States of turning Ukraine into a “powder keg” with increasing arms supplies to the country.

NATO, meanwhile, has told Ukraine to roll out domestic reforms and develop its defence capabilities in order to be considered for membership.

While a ceasefire halted full-scale warfare in Donbas in 2015, sporadic clashes never ceased [File: Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters] Zelensky said on Friday that he had again raised the issue of Ukraine’s NATO membership bid while attending talks with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris. German Chancellor Angela Merkel also joined the discussions in the French capital via video link.

The Ukrainian president told reporters following the meeting that he felt supported by France and Germany, both of which are NATO members, with regards to his country’s action plan for joining the alliance.

He also said he was ready to hold four-way talks that included Russian President Vladimir Putin to calm relations with its neighbour, adding that he thought a separate meeting between US President Joe Biden and Putin proposed by Washington could help solve some issues.

Putin urged to pull back

Kyiv earlier this week pinned the blame for the escalating tensions with Russia squarely on Moscow, with Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba condemning the Kremlin’s “aggravation of the security situation” in the region.

Addressing a news conference on Thursday, Kuleba accused Russian pundits and officials of “openly threatening Ukraine with war and the destruction of Ukrainian statehood”.

He also warned Moscow against initiating any incursion into Ukraine, stating any intensification of the escalation in the Donbas region would have “very painful” consequences for Russia.

“The red line of Ukraine is the state border. If Russia crosses the red line, then it will have to suffer,” he said. “The world is on the side of Ukraine and international law.”

Putin has overseen the massing of tens of thousands of troops as well as tanks and artillery near Russia’s shared eastern border with Ukraine [File: Mikhail Metzel/Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP] The Kremlin has repeatedly denied interfering in Donbas, but Ukraine and several Western countries have said separatist forces in the region have been armed, led, funded and aided by Russia.

Moscow has also said its troop movements in the region pose no threat and are merely defensive. It has also stated the military units would remain in position as long as the Kremlin saw fit.

But the buildup has alarmed Ukraine’s allies, prompting calls from NATO and several of the alliance’s member states – including the US, Germany and France – for Putin to order a pullback.

In the latest such appeal, Macron, Merkel and Zelensky on Friday jointly urged Moscow to reverse course.

“They demanded the withdrawal of these reinforcements to reach a de-escalation,” the chancellery in Berlin said in a statement following the trio’s meeting.",752,4732,11,62

We have an obligation to do more to make sure that historically underrepresented groups’ blood has a place in our veins because they hold the same key to eternal youth as any white person in their teens and 20s.” At press time, the billionaires claimed this was just the first step, and that within the next 5 to 10 years they plan to start harvesting organs from healthy, young minorities.

Sometimes, things can get so bad that they’ll even just give up playing the game entirely.” Gideon added that the research highlighted significant economic disparity as well, as wealthier gamers could afford the DLCs and in-game purchases needed to reach the boss’s castle.

London - Asharq Al-Awsat

History buffs will be able to roam the ruins of Rome's ""Area Sacra,"" perhaps catching a glimpse of Julius Caesar's ghost, after the site becomes an open-air museum next year.

Work to adapt the Largo Argentina archaeological site containing the ruins of four Roman temples for tourists begins next month, Rome Mayor Virginia Raggi announced.

""With this work we'll begin entering into the area and... walk among the vestiges of our history. Meanwhile, people can observe the site from its surrounding without stepping in it, because it's located few meters under the ground surface,"" she said at a press conference, AFP reported.

Julius Caesar is believed to have been stabbed in the Curia Pompei, a Senate building, part of whose limestone foundation is still visible.

But visitors are more likely to spot an apparition of the four-legged kind – namely, a cat.

The ruins are the domain of a colony of hundreds of rescued cats, fed, sterilized and cared for by a private non-profit shelter, who scamper through the site, lounging atop truncated marble pillars or posing for tourist photos – altogether unimpressed by the historical significance of their vast litterbox.

The temples, which date to between the third and second centuries B.C., include a circular monument to the goddess of Fortune, whose colossal marble head now sits in Rome's Centrale Montemartini museum.

They were uncovered as recently as 1926 in an urban planning project when demolished medieval houses revealed ancient Roman ruins underneath.",267,1668,12,68

European soccer's governing body UEFA has warned clubs linked to a breakaway Super League that they face being banned from domestic and international competitions if they set up a rival to the Champions League.

In a joint statement with Spanish, English and Italian leagues and federations, UEFA said it will consider ""all measures"", including the courts and bans from domestic leagues, in opposition to plans for a breakaway competition.

UEFA said it had learnt that clubs from those countries ""may be planning to announce their creation of a closed, so-called Super League"".

""If this were to happen, we wish to reiterate that we....(and) also FIFA and all our member associations - will remain united in our efforts to stop this cynical project, a project that is founded on the self-interest of a few clubs at a time when society needs solidarity more than ever,"" UEFA said.

""We will consider all measures available to us, at all levels, both judicial and sporting in order to prevent this happening. Football is based on open competitions and sporting merit; it cannot be any other way,"" the statement added.

In January, FIFA had said that a breakaway league would not be recognised and that ""any club or player involved in such a competition would as a consequence not be allowed to participate in any competition organised by FIFA or their respective confederation"" - meaning players would be banned from the World Cup.

Sunday's UEFA statement said: ""The clubs concerned will be banned from playing in any other competition at domestic, European or world level, and their players could be denied the opportunity to represent their national teams.

""We thank those clubs in other countries, especially the French and German clubs, who have refused to sign up to this. We call on all lovers of football, supporters and politicians, to join us in fighting against such a project if it were to be announced.

REUTERS/Issei Kato

Japan's financially challenged Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) is expected to show off a new ""must-succeed"" car and explain its green-car strategy for China at the Shanghai auto show which starts on Monday, two company officials told Reuters.

The car Nissan plans to show off at the motor show is the significantly redesigned X-Trail sport-utility vehicle (SUV). A similar SUV called the Rogue hit the U.S. market last year. The new X-Trail will be available in China later this year.

The new car is powered by a fuel-sipping three-cylinder, petrol-powered turbo engine, which one of the sources said might face an uphill battle in gaining acceptance in China where similar technologies have proven unpopular.

The car is a ""must succeed, a must win car for us,"" one of the two sources said. Both sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak with reporters.

In addition to the X-Trail's China debut, Nissan's chief operating officer Ashwani Gupta is expected to tell reporters in Shanghai virtually from Japan on Monday that Nissan's green car strategy is two-pronged: the company will focus on fuel efficiency-enhancing petrol-electric hybrid technology, as well as battery electric cars to make its lineup of vehicles in China greener.

In January, Nissan said all its new vehicles in key markets, including China, would be electrified by the early 2030s, as part of its efforts to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

The strategy comes as regulatory pressure in China grows on carmakers to slash emissions.

China is a key pillar of Nissan's turnaround strategy, which involves focusing on producing profitable cars for China, Japan and the United States, rather than chasing all-out global growth pursued by ousted boss Carlos Ghosn.

The company is scrambling to slash its production capacity and model line-up by a fifth and to cut fixed costs by 300 billion yen ($2.8 billion). Nissan aims to achieve a 5% operating profit margin and a sustainable global market share of 6% by the end of fiscal year 2023

It wasn't immediately clear how much detail Nissan plans to share on its China strategy on Monday.

The two sources said Nissan nonetheless plans to start taking ""pre-orders"" in China for its upcoming electric Ariya SUV before the end of this year.

Nissan also plans to launch a hybrid ""e-Power"" version of the Sylphy compact car this year and an e-Power X-Trail as early as next year.

A company spokeswoman said Nissan plans to showcase in Shanghai the redesign X-Trail crossover, as well as the introduction of Nissan's e-power petrol-electric hybrid technology to China. She declined to comment otherwise.

In the past few days, three large boroughs of London have been in the spotlight of COVID surge testing.

Health officials tested around 650,000 people and it was reported ""dozens"" of cases of the South African variant were found in Wandsworth and Lambeth.

The figures released today would not have included any instances of the variant found in the surge testing - as it takes a few days for results to be confirmed.

The news comes as a coronavirus variant with a ""double mutation"" was detected in the UK after having first emerged in India.

A total of 77 cases of the variant, known as B.1.617, have been found across the country - 73 in England and four in Scotland - in the days leading up to 14 April, the latest update from PHE revealed.

The strain is of particular concern because it features two mutations in the spike protein combined in the same virus, prompting fears it may be more infectious or less susceptible to vaccines.

It has been classified as a ""variant under investigation"".

India reported a daily increase of 217,353 infections over the past 24 hours, the country's second record in consecutive days but the country is not on the UK government's 'red list' so there is no requirement for hotel quarantine of people travelling inward from there.

Instead, they are required to take two COVID tests and quarantine at home for 10 days.

Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the double mutation discovery could be cause for significant concern.

BEIJING (AP) — China said Friday it has expressed “serious concerns” to the United States and Japan over what it calls negative moves and collusion between the two countries against China.

The statement from Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian came just before President Joe Biden welcomes Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to the White House on Friday in his first face-to-face meeting with a foreign leader.

That meeting is seen as reflecting Biden’s emphasis on strengthening alliances to deal with a more assertive China and other global challenges.

Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing that Japan and the United States should “take China’s concerns and demands seriously, avoid words and actions that interfere in China’s internal affairs and harm China’s interests.”

“China has no objection to the development of normal bilateral relations between Japan and the United States, but such relations should help enhance mutual understanding and trust among regional countries and contribute to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, and should not target or harm the interests of third parties,” Zhao said.

China would “make necessary responses as appropriate,” he said.

Biden and Suga see their meeting as a chance to counter messaging from Chinese President Xi Jinping that America and democracies in general are on the decline, after the political turmoil and backing away from global leadership that marked Donald Trump’s presidency.

Japan remains China’s traditional rival dating from Tokyo’s brutal WWII occupation of much of the country. Relations between Washington and Beijing are tenser than ever over trade, technology, Hong Kong, Taiwan and human rights, particularly China’s policies toward Turkic Muslims in the northwestern region of Xinjiang.

U.S. and Chinese naval movements in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea, which China claims virtually in its entirety, have added to tensions in recent days, following statements from U.S. officials that Beijing may be accelerating its schedule to annex Taiwan by force.

The Biden administration says the primary challenge for the United States lies in managing U.S. policies toward the Indo-Pacific, the main theater in which China is flexing its growing economic and military power. That helped guide Biden’s decision, announced this week, to pull U.S. troops out of Afghanistan and free the administration to focus more on East Asia.",569,3594,9,57

Some 1,700 people braved the icy temperatures to take part in the sexy descent at the popular Sheregesh ski resort on Saturday, according to the organizers.

Despite the numbers being impressive, they fell short of a Guinness world record for the most crowded semi-naked downhill event, which was set at the same location a few years ago.

The reason for that is the Covid-19 pandemic, which prevented foreign guests from making it to the Siberian slopes this time.

Nonetheless, the Russian daredevils still had a lot of fun, while also getting a ton of cool content for their social media pages.

Russia accused a Ukrainian diplomat on Saturday of trying to obtain classified information and ordered him to leave the country by April 22, prompting a like-for-like response from Ukraine as border tensions simmer.

Russia's FSB security service said Oleksandr Sosoniuk had been detained when he tried to access information from Russian law enforcement databases during a meeting with a Russian citizen.

The foreign ministry gave Sosoniuk 72 hours to leave, and Ukraine then did likewise to a Russian diplomat in Kyiv.

Ukraine's foreign ministry said Sosoniuk had been held for several hours before being allowed to return to his consulate in St Petersburg, and called the detention a provocation.

""We fully deny the accusations levelled against the consular officer,"" it said in a statement.

Tensions between Moscow and Kyiv have been rising amid a build-up of Russian troops along the border and clashes in eastern Ukraine between the army and pro-Russian separatists.

REUTERS/Angus Mordant

Global oil prices could drop to around $40 a barrel by 2030 if governments push to reduce fuel consumption in step with U.N.-backed plans to limit global warming, a leading energy consultancy said on Thursday.

In a report outlining a scenario where the world acts decisively to tackle greenhouse gas emissions by electrifying transport and industry, Edinburgh-based Wood Mackenzie said oil consumption would begin a steep drop as early as in 2023.

The decline in demand would accelerate to a rate of 2 million barrels of oil per day (bpd) to reach 35 million bpd by 2050, accounting for a 60% drop in carbon emissions from oil use from today's levels.

Oil consumption hit a record of around 100 million bpd in 2019 and is expected to recover strongly this year after cratering last year due to the coronavirus epidemic.

As a result, oil prices would begin to slip later this decade, WoodMac said in its report. Under its Accelerated Energy Transition scenario, it expects Brent crude prices to average $40 per barrel by 2030, compared with current prices of around $65 a barrel.

By 2050, Brent may slide to $10 to $18 a barrel.

""If we move to keep global warming to the 2 degrees Celsius limit set by the (U.N.-backed) Paris Agreement, the energy matrix will change – and change profoundly,"" said WoodMac's Ann-Louise Hittle.

The world's current policies are nevertheless far from aligned with the Paris agreement, with temperatures currently on course to rise by 3 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels by 2100, WoodMac stressed.

A rapid decline in demand also means that existing sources of oil supplies would be sufficient to meet all future demand, with only limited need for new oifield developments, WoodMac said.

A sharp fall in oil demand and prices in the coming decades would have a profound impact on major oil producers such as members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, WoodMac said.

""The steep fall in demand prevents those key oil producers from managing the market and supporting prices in the way it does today. Despite losing their price-setting ability, however, low-cost Middle East OPEC producers remain core providers of oil.""

Natural gas, the least polluting fossil fuel, would, however, fare better than oil by replacing coal for power generation, particularly in fast-growing Asian economies, the report added.

As oil prices declined, gas would eventually trade at a premium to oil under WoodMac's scenario. Benchmark U.S. Henry Hub prices are forecast to trade at $3 to $4 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) under WoodMac's scenario.

Gas demand in Asia would increase on average by 1.5% a year through to 2050, offsetting declines in more mature markets, which would be switching to renewables from gas.

SANTIAGO, Chile -- A real-world study of millions of Chileans who had received the Chinese-developed CoronaVac vaccine has found it 67% effective against symptoms and 80% against death from COVID-19, the South American country's Health Ministry said Friday.

Ministry adviser Rafael Araos said the study covered 10.5 million people, including 2.5 million who had received both doses of the vaccine and 1.5 million who had received a single dose between Feb. 2 and April 1.

It counted cases starting 14 days after application of the second dose of the vaccine, which in Chile was given 28 days after the first.

The vaccine has been widely used across the world, though not in the United States or Europe.

Araos said it had reduced hospitalizations by 85%, intensive care visits by 89% and deaths by 80%.

It is one of the broadest studies so far published of any of the vaccines used against the new coronavirus. Most previous studies were based on clinical studies of limited groups of thousands of people given the vaccines to test efficacy and safety prior to general use.

Chile has led the region with a vaccination campaign that has reached 40% of its 19 million people overall — and 27% of those have so far received both doses. It began in large part among the elderly and health workers, but has expanded to include essential workers and recently people as young as 48.

It has contracted for 60 million doses of the CoronaVac vaccine produced by Sinovac over three years, and also has been using vaccines produced by Pfizer. About 90% of vaccines used so far in Chile have been CoronaVac.

Authorities reported Thursday that Chile had been a sharp reduction in hospitalization of people 70 or older, something credited to the vaccination campaign among the elderly. But it has also seen “a sustained rise” in hospitalizations of people 59 and younger.

0,‘We love foie gras’: French outrage at UK plan to ban imports of ‘cruel’ delicacy,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/17/we-love-foie-gras-french-outrage-uk-plan-import-ban-delicacy,"The head of France’s foie gras producers’ association has said she is “shocked and outraged” that the British government is considering banning imports of the product.

And she has invited MPs to visit French farms producing foie gras to see the force feeding of ducks and geese and judge for themselves whether it is “cruel and torturous”, as animal rights campaigners claim.

Marie-Pierre Pé, director of the Comité Interprofessionnel des Palmipèdes à Foie Gras (CIFOG), which represents about 3,500 foie gras producers, said: “I am shocked and I deplore the fact that the freedom to sell a perfectly healthy product defined under international conventions is threatened.

“For a country that promotes freedom of trade, it is not only paradoxical but shows a lack of understanding of our production as well as the problem of judgments based on anthropomorphic perceptions that the animal used in the production is suffering.

“Clearly, they don’t know how we do our job. Before taking this decision I invite them to visit a foie gras producer so they can make a rational decision. We have nothing to hide and we operate with complete transparency.”

Asked about the gavage, the most controversial aspect of foie gras production, where long tubes are pushed down the birds throat to pump food into the digestive system, causing the liver to swell to several times its natural size, Pé said campaigners were anthropomorphising – attributing human characteristics to animals – by claiming this harmed or hurt the ducks and geese.

“People have to stop imaging a tube being inserted in their own throat, because a duck and goose’s throat is nothing like yours. For a start, the duck’s throat is elastic and at the base there is a pocket that allows them to stock food – called gésiers, which is like our stomach,” she said.

“It does no harm to them. Of course, you have to know how to insert the tube, but if done properly the animal does not suffer and scientific studies have been made into the possible effects of the gavage, so we know.”

“The gavage is done twice a day respecting the digestive rhythm of the animal. We cannot force the digestive cycle because if we did it would then get blocked and you wouldn’t get the foie gras.

“We cannot say there are no accidents from time to time, but it is exceptional. A farmer has no interest in harming his own animals because that would kill them – and his production.”

A cross-party group of British MPs has written to ministers urging them to ban sales of foie gras in the UK. The letter to the environment secretary, George Eustice, and the animal welfare minister, Lord Goldsmith, was coordinated by the campaign group Animal Equality.

“Over the coming months, thousands more ducks and geese will endure torturous treatment for this cruel product,” the letter states.

The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it was “exploring further restrictions” to the delicacy following reports that Goldsmith was determined to ban sales in the UK, having described it earlier this year as “unbearably barbaric”.

Abigail Penny, executive director of Animal Equality UK, said: “Foie gras is the definition of animal cruelty and people are clearly united in their hatred for this wicked product. We simply cannot tolerate this any longer. A ban can’t come soon enough.”

However, opponents of a ban disagree. Richard Corrigan, who runs several Mayfair restaurants, has said that a ban would take the UK into “nanny-state territory”, while George Pell, the co-owner of L’Escargot, said there was a “paradox between people happily eating industrially farmed food products and advocating the ban”.

Pé said the legality of foie gras production had been examined “several times” and had been found to conform with European food regulations.

“Yes, there have been videos with shocking images from farms but they are exceptions and those farms do not reflect our sector and our profession,” she said. “Our farms are controlled by the authorities and the producers pledge to guarantee the welfare of the animal.”

She added: “I can understand if people don’t like foie gras, or they don’t want to eat animals or animal products, but there is respect for the animals in our production. I have no problem stating this because I know it is true.

“I am outraged and sad,” Pé said. “Surely the British government will not pass a law based on one-sided arguments. I personally invite them to come and see for themselves.”

Pé said foie gras had been singled out for a ban, “because foie gras is a gastronomic symbol of France. I think we are an easy target.

“It’s a recurrent theme and strategy by the animal rights groups. They produce sensational images to influence economics. We should ask ourselves, ‘are we being manipulated?’”

France is the world’s largest producer, consumer and exporter of foie gras. CIFOG says French farmers produced 15,000 tonnes of foie gras last year – down on the 18,800 tonnes produced in 2019 – mostly in and around the Périgord region, in south-west France. Up to 5,000 tonnes are exported annually, with up to 200 tonnes a year coming to Britain.

Pé said that despite Covid restrictions that shut winter markets and hit sales before the Christmas holidays – a period when foie gras is traditionally eaten – producers reported 1.2 million new French buyers in 2020. The sector has since been hit by outbreaks of avian flu.

“There is no problem in terms of support for our products in France,” she said. “The French love foie gras, there is extraordinary support for it,” she added.

Biden hosted Suga for talks on Friday that offered the Democratic president a chance to work further on his pledge to revitalise US alliances that frayed under his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump.

China topped the agenda, underscoring Japan’s central role in Washington’s efforts to face down Beijing. The two leaders addressed an array of geopolitical issues, including Taiwan, with Suga saying they reaffirmed “the importance of peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait”, a slap at Beijing’s increased military pressure on the Chinese-claimed, self-ruled island.

“Today prime minister Suga and I affirmed our ironclad support for the US-Japanese alliance and for our shared security,” Biden told a joint news conference in the White House Rose Garden, calling the discussions “productive”.

“We committed to working together to take on the challenges from China and on issues like the East China Sea, the South China Sea, as well as North Korea, to ensure a future of a free and open Indo-Pacific.”

Other pressing concerns at the talks included China’s increased military movements near Taiwan, its tightening grip on Hong Kong and its crackdown on Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang.

In another swipe at China, Biden said the US and Japan would invest together in areas such as 5G, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, genomics and semiconductor supply chains.

Suga said he and Biden agreed on the necessity of frank discussions with China in the context of Beijing’s activities in the Indo-Pacific region.

China said on Saturday that Taiwan, Hong Kong and Xinjiang were China’s internal affairs and should not be interfered with.

The summit - Biden’s first in-person meeting with a foreign leader as president - came just days after China sent 25 aircraft, including fighters and nuclear-capable bombers, near Taiwan, which Beijing considers a wayward province.

Suga said the talks acknowledged the “importance of peace and stability” in the Taiwan Strait as he continued Japan’s recent policy of trying to balance security concerns about China with economic ties.

A senior US official said earlier that the summit had been expected to produce a formal statement on Taiwan. After the talks, it was unclear whether this would happen. Any such joint statement would be the first on Taiwan – China’s most sensitive territorial issue – by US and Japanese leaders since 1969.

China’s foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, said China has expressed solemn concern about “collusion” between Japan and the US, and the countries should take China’s concerns seriously.

Speaking later to a Washington think tank, Suga said Japan would say what is needed to be said to China and speak up on human rights, but also stressed the need to establish a stable, constructive relationship with Beijing.

At the White House news conference, Suga said he told Biden that he was committed to moving forward with the summer Olympic Games in Japan and that Biden offered his support. Japan is grappling with rising coronavirus infections with fewer than 100 days until the planned start.

“I told the president about my determination to realise the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic games this summer as a symbol of global unity,” Suga said.

As they sat down for talks, Biden, Suga and their two delegations all wore masks, in keeping with protocols to protect against the spread of Covid-19.

Biden appeared determined to get off on the right foot with Suga after four years in which Trump sometimes chastised allies in Asia and elsewhere over what he saw as insufficient defence spending or funding for US troop presence and questioned the value of bedrock military alliances.

With the Suga meeting and another planned summit with South Korea in May, Biden hopes to energize joint efforts with Australia, India and Japan in a grouping known as the Quad, as well as with South Korea, to counter China and longtime US foe North Korea.",670,4152,17,84

I guess he could be keeping that to himself, but most of what he’s drawing is just Rayman innocently hanging out with the Raving Rabbids. So, I guess Joe just genuinely appreciates Rayman’s powers and design in a platonic way? Ugh.

The proposed Colombo Port City Economic Commission Bill will turn the Colombo Port City--a dream project of Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa--into a Chinese colony, an opposition party in Sri Lanka alleged.

Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the leader of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) party, said on Monday that the bill would allow the city to function beyond the existing laws of the country.

He further added that the proposed bill which was included in the Order Paper of Parliament would empower the president to appoint a Colombo Port City Economic Commission which includes five or seven members named by him.

Under the bill, the commission would be empowered with special financial power and judicial immunity, he claimed.

Local businesses, he said, would not be allowed to establish laws in the post-city areas. Another controversial clause is the payment of salary to the staff working in the port city zone. The rules will empower the commission to pay salaries to employees even in foreign currencies.

There was a threat of the Port City becoming a separate territory with independent powers devoid of common laws of the country, he said. He stressed the need to defeat it being enacted in Parliament.

The leader claimed he would challenge the bill legally in court.",214,1319,13,85

I worked hard all my life to get that ball, and that large black linebacker—or maybe he was even a defensive end—ripped it out of my hands and just ran away.

It was just clear they have no respect for me, the grandson of World War II veterans.

It is only as real as we make it. Disease does not need to exist, foul trouble does not need to exist.

The EU, which aims to support Britain and the United States in upholding human rights in Hong Kong, was due to make its statement on Monday at a meeting of EU foreign ministers, but failed to win the necessary agreement from all 27 EU states.

""Hungary's argument was that the EU already has too many issues with China,"" a senior EU diplomat told Reuters. A second senior diplomat confirmed the blockage and Hungary's position. An EU official said the statement had been withdrawn from the EU's approval process.

China and the EU imposed tit-for-tat sanctions over Western accusations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang on March 22.

Hungarian diplomats in Brussels were not immediately available for comment. Budapest reluctantly supported the EU sanctions last month, calling them ""pointless"", and hosted China's defence minister for an official visit days after the EU sanctions decision.

Hungary is a large recipient of Chinese investment. In the past both Hungary and Greece, where China's COSCO Shipping has a majority stake in Greece's largest port, have blocked EU statements on China.

Beijing's top representative in Hong Kong this week warned foreign powers that they would be taught a lesson if they tried to interfere in China's management of the global financial hub, as tensions escalated between China and Western governments over the city. read more

The West says the new Hong Kong security law breaks a promise to maintain a high degree of autonomy for the city since its 1997 return to Chinese rule. China's supporters say the law has restored order following mass anti-government and anti-China protests in 2019.

The impasse is the latest blow to the EU's credentials as a defender of human rights, one of the diplomats said, and raises questions about the economically powerful EU's ""soft power"" that relies on inspiring countries to follow its example by outlawing the death penalty and upholding press freedoms.

It also underscores the EU's challenge in balancing business ties with China, its second-largest trade partner, and its ability to speak out against Chinese government crackdowns in Hong Kong, on human rights lawyers since 2015 and on Muslim Uighurs in northwestern China.

0,"Brazil Congress moves to reward Amazon land grabbers: new laws would would grant invaders of public forests with land titles, instead of punishing them and returning lands to the state",https://news.mongabay.com/2021/04/bills-before-brazil-congress-slammed-for-rewarding-amazon-land-grabbers/,"Two bills, one each in the upper and lower houses of Congress, would grant invaders of public forests with land titles, instead of punishing them and returning the land to the state.

The proposals also increase the area of properties eligible for regularization without an on-site inspection, and risk exacerbating land conflicts in Brazil.

Both bills were born from an executive order from President Jair Bolsonaro that expired in May last year.

The backers of the bills say they would facilitate the regularization of the lands of small farmers, but environmental and land issues experts say the main beneficiaries will be land grabbers and large farmers.

Imagine you have invaded a public land in the middle of the Amazon Rainforest, cut the forest down and, after all that, you get the papers that certify you as the rightful owner of that area. According to experts, that’s what’s going to happen with the passage of two bills currently before the Brazilian Congress.

Both proposals have a common root: Executive Order 910, known as MP 910 or MP of Grilagem, from the local term for a land grabber. The executive order was signed in 2019 by far-right President Jair Bolsonaro. As it wasn’t approved on time by Congress, however, the rule expired in May last year. Legislators came up with two new pieces of legislation to replace it: bills 2633 and 510.

The new legislation would apply to so-called federal public forests, areas that belong to the Union and haven’t been designated for any specific purpose yet, such as for conservation units, Indigenous territories or land reform settlements, for instance. According to IPAM, the Amazon Environmental Research Institute, almost 19 million hectares (47 million acres) of land in the Amazon fits this description — an area nearly twice the size of South Korea. Almost 80% of it is already illegally claimed by private owners through the Rural Environmental Registry (CAR), a self-declared land register that anyone can fill out online.

According to Philip Fearnside, an ecologist at the National Institute for Research in Amazonia (INPA), this is the first step toward legalizing land invasions. “These are illegal operators who claim large areas of usually government land and then, by various means, often illegal, they manage to get the title to it. And whether or not they get the title, they subdivide and sell the land to ranchers, migrants or whoever is interested in buying it,” he said. Usually, these lands are deforested to clear pasture for livestock.

Senate bill PL 510, from Senator Irajá Silvestre Filho, is almost as permissive as the executive order it derives from. It would allow the regularization of lands up to 2,500 hectares (6,180 acres) occupied until 2014; under the current law, the cutoff is 2011. To receive the title to the land, there wouldn’t even need to be an on-site inspection; the verification would be made only through satellite imagery. Under the current law, such an exemption of on-the ground inspections only applies to areas smaller than 400 hectares (990 acres).

The other bill, PL 2633, is before the lower house of Congress, known as the Chamber of Deputies. Proposed by Federal Deputy José Silva Soares, better known as Zé Silva, it’s a bit less generous with land invaders. It would maintain the current cutoff time for regularizing occupied land but raise the maximum area for exemption of on-site inspection to properties up to 600 hectares (1,480 acres). “The difference from our project to MP 910 is clear as oil and water. We are giving a new message for ourselves and for the international market that it is not worthy to occupy public land in Brazil, as we are keeping the temporal milestone,” Silva told Mongabay.

Titling

The most contentious parts of the bills, however, concern areas that don’t meet titling requirements. The evaluation is from Brenda Brito, a researcher from Imazon that is among the largest specialists in the Amazonian land situation. Both bills state that properties occupied after a certain cutoff date (2011 for PL 2633, and 2014 for PL 510) may be put up for sale by the government. In Irajá’s proposal, the invader of the area would be given preference to buy the land.

“Why should this land stop being public, if it was illegally occupied?” said Brenda Brito from Imazon, a leading research institute on the Amazon. She said that besides favoring privatization as the means for resolving the status of these areas — rather than conservation units or Indigenous territories, for example — the bills open space to the legalization of areas invaded after the cutoff dates. “We are not talking about lands invaded in the past, but about lands invaded now and in the future. It will force the areas that are being illegally occupied to be put for sale. If it happens, we can say goodbye to public forests,” Brito said.

The easing of rules to legalize invasions of public lands in Brazil isn’t a recent phenomenon. It started in 2005, under the administration of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, deepened under his successor, Michel Temer, in 2017, and has taken a more urgent turn under Bolsonaro. “We have these successive flexibilizations. It’s endless. The end is when we don’t have more forest to be cut,” Brito said.

“It is like drawing a line in the sand,” Fearnside said. “If you are a land grabber it means that you rather grab your land now and wait a few years until the line moves and you can legalize it.”

Land conflicts may increase

Increasing the size of the areas eligible for legalization without an on-site inspection, as proposed in the bills, may trigger new conflicts in a country where land grabbing already drives a litany of crimes. According to the Pastoral Land Commission (CPT), a Catholic Church-affiliated organization, in 2019 Brazil registered 1,833 conflicts in rural areas. That was the highest number since 2010, and resulted in 32 murders.

Imazon’s Brito said doing away with on-the-ground inspections increases the risk that land still under dispute is granted a title. “Remote detection can be used to check many things, but not if the occupation of the land is peaceful,” she said.

Proponents of the bills say it would accelerate the legalization of land to small farmers, since the government doesn’t have enough personnel to visit the areas. “We have to separate the criminal, the land grabber, from the producer [farmer],” Silva said. “The producer will be the great fiscal to preserve the environment.”

The problem, according to Fearnside, is what the legislators consider to be a small farm. He said the current law already allows the exemption of on-site inspections for properties up to 400 hectares. Anyone who owns that much land “is already a small entrepreneur rancher, not a poor family,” Fearnside said. “Obviously, someone who has 2,500 hectares [as proposed by PL 510] is not a small farmer.”

PL 510 is under discussion in the Senate and PL 2633 is before the Chamber of Deputies. Since February, the speakers of both houses have been closely aligned with Bolsonaro, which increases the prospect of the bills being passed. “That completely changes the scenario and these bills can move forward very fast,” Fearnside said.

Senator Irajá didn’t respond to Mongabay’s request for an interview.

KIA soldiers seen at the frontline in Tanai Township, Kachin State in 2018. / The Irrawaddy

The Myanmar military has reportedly suffered heavy casualties following attacks launched by the ethnic armed group the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) on a military base and convoy in Kachin State on Thursday.

On the morning of April 15 the KIA attacked a Tatmadaw (Myanmar military) base in the area of Nam Byu in Tanai Township. The base had been captured by the Tatmadaw from the KIA in 2018. Immediately after the attack, two military fighter jets launched airstrikes in the area.

A resident said, “There was heavy fighting in the area from 6 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. We saw the dead bodies of Myanmar soldiers being taken away by the Tatmadaw after the attack”.

“We were not able to count [dead bodies] because there were many soldiers guarding the area,” he added.

The military-controlled MRTV said that at least 100 KIA soldiers had launched an attack on the Nam Byu base at 6 am, and claimed that the Tatmadaw suffered no casualties.

KIA information officer Colonel. Naw Bu refused to give casualty details as he was unable to reach the area.

However, a KIA officer on the ground told The Irrawaddy that “We could not retake our base yesterday. We had to retreat because of the airstrikes. But I am sure that they lost many soldiers [during the attack]”.

At around 4am on Thursday the KIA also attacked a Tatmadaw convoy in Bhamo Township. The convoy was on its way to reinforce troops attempting to retake a strategically-located KIA base in Alaw Bum near the border with China.

The KIA said that that it used mines against 16 military trucks near Sihub village. One truck went up in flames and the Tatmadaw took casualties during the attack, according to the KIA.

KIA soldiers captured the Alaw Bum base on March 25. Since April 10, there has been heavy fighting between the Tatmadaw and the KIA as the regime’s forces have attempted to retake the base. The Tatmadaw has lost at least 100 soldiers during the fighting, including a battalion commander, despite using airstrikes on the KIA forces.

“There was no fighting this morning. But the Tatmadaw keep reinforcing their troops, so there will be heavy fighting in the coming days,” a KIA officer said.

On Friday morning nearly 300 people from Myothit, Konlaw and Num Laung villages fled their homes for a Kachin Baptist Convention centre in Momauk Township, after the Tatmadaw launched airstrikes and artillery attacks near the villages.

Clashes were also reported in at least two places in Putao Township. Fighting has intensified across Kachin State and northern Shan State since March 11, following the KIA’s refusal to recognize the military regime.

The KIA has attacked military and police outposts and has threatened to step up its attacks if the junta continues to shoot peaceful protesters across the country.

That database tracks mass killings defined as four or more dead, not including the shooter.

President Joe Biden last week announced a half-dozen executive actions to combat what he called an ""epidemic and an international embarrassment"" of gun violence in America. But he said much more is needed.

Here are a few recent mass shootings.

ATLANTA

Eight people were killed by a gunman at three Atlanta-area massage businesses in attacks that began the evening of March 16. Seven of the slain were women, and six were of Asian descent. Police charged a 21-year-old white man with the killings. There was deep skepticism over the shooter's claim his motive was sex addiction. There was public clamouring for hate crime charges, especially among the Asian American community, which has faced rising numbers of attacks since the coronavirus pandemic took hold.

0,International team creates first chimeric human-monkey embryos,https://www.statnews.com/2021/04/15/international-team-creates-first-chimeric-human-monkey-embryos/,"A team of scientists from the U.S., China, and Spain reported Thursday they have created the first embryos that were part human and part monkey and kept them alive for up to 20 days in laboratory dishes.

The ethically controversial creation of chimeras — containing cells from multiple species — is part of a drive to make experimental models to help scientists better understand early development, devise new treatments for human disease, and possibly find methods to grow organs for transplant inside other animals, such as pigs or sheep. Such chimeras can be used in experiments that can’t be done with human embryos, for example, but combining human cells with those of primates ushers in new and urgent ethical concerns.

To be clear, the work, published in the journal Cell, is in very early stages. The team did not create living, breathing part-human animals. They created very early embryos and never implanted them into the uterus of any animal. Concerns about human-animal chimeras center on what Stanford bioethicist and legal scholar Hank Greely calls “brains, balls, and beauty” — worries that an animal could look at all human, be born with a human brain, or be able to reproduce.

This experiment carried none of those risks, but makes it clear that the time to start discussing the ethics of human-animal chimeras is now. “It’s a first-in-kind experiment,” Nita Farahany, a professor of law and philosophy at the Duke University School of Law who co-authored a perspective piece on the ethics of the research, told STAT. “Whenever you cross a major technological or biological hurdle like this one, it’s a good moment to stop and reflect.”

The report provides the scientific details of work that began several years ago in Spain and China and made waves after it was leaked to the El País newspaper in 2019. (The Covid-19 pandemic delayed the completion and publication of the work, the researchers said.)

In the experiment, researchers injected 25 of a specific kind of human pluripotent stem cell (called “pinnacle stem cells” because they can turn into any kind of cell, including extraembryonic cells such as placenta) into each of 132 6-day-old macaque monkey embryos. The researchers stained the human cells with an exceptionally bright red fluorescent protein called tdTomato so they would be detectable within the monkey embryo as it developed.

The scientists took advantage of a new technique that allowed them to grow monkey embryos outside the womb for up to 20 days, a stage where the embryos were still largely undeveloped, but had formed layers and cavities. Survival of the embryos declined during the experiment; after 10 days, 103 embryos were still developing, and by day 19, just three of the chimeric embryos remained alive. (After 20 days, monkey embryos grown outside the womb, even those that are not chimeric, simply collapse.)

Still, the researchers found a high number of human cells in the chimeric embryos that survived. On average, 3% to 4% of the cells in the embryos were human, and in one embryo, up to 7% were. “When we observed human cells were alive in monkey embryos, that was amazing,” Tao Tan, a principal investigator at the State Key Laboratory of Primate Biomedical Research and Kunming University of Science and Technology in Yunnan, China, and one of the paper’s lead authors, told STAT.

Work published earlier this year by a research group in France showed that human cells did not survive well in monkey embryos. The key to the success in the new paper may be the particular stem cells that were used, as well as the way they were cultured.

The work, other scientists said, is the most successful to date in keeping a relatively large number of human cells alive and healthy in a nonhuman embryo. “This paper is a dramatic demonstration of the ability of human pluripotent stem cells to be incorporated into the embryos of the cynomolgus monkey,” said Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz, a developmental biologist at Caltech whose lab first developed, in mice, the technique of growing embryos in lab dishes. Such work gained increasing attention with the announcement last month that Jacob Hanna, a developmental biologist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, had kept mouse embryos alive and seemingly healthy for an extended period in an artificial womb.

The results published Thursday showed a far higher rate of survival for human cells in a nonhuman embryo than in previous experiments with sheep-human or pig-human chimeras, where sometimes just one in 100,000 cells were human.

It was those disappointing results that pushed the researchers to turn to monkeys, which are much more closely related to humans and have a similar developmental timeline, said the project’s leader, Salk Institute developmental biologist Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte. “Human cells do not robustly contribute to chimera formation in species evolutionarily distant to humans,” he said.

In monkeys, it was a different story. “We found the human and monkey cells cooperate with each other in building the embryo,” said Jun Wu, a research team member who is now an assistant professor at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, but was a staff scientist at the Salk when he worked on the project. Wu’s research has shown that when human cells are placed in culture with mouse cells, “we see the mouse cell actively kill the human cell, but when we place human and monkey cells together, there is no competition.”

Experiments such as this one cannot be funded with federal research dollars, though they break no U.S. laws. The work was conducted in China, not because it was illegal in the United States, the researchers said, but because the monkey embryos, which are difficult to procure and expensive, were available there. The experiment used a total of 150 embryos, which were obtained without harming the monkeys, “just like in the IVF procedure,” Tan said.

But such experiments, which combine human cells with those of animals, are nevertheless controversial. This work, and other work by Izpisua Belmonte, has moved so rapidly, bioethicists have had trouble keeping up.

“The complicated thing is that we need better models of human disease, but the better those models are, the closer they bring us to the ethical issues we were trying to avoid by not doing experiments in humans,” Farahany said. “Remarkable steps forward require urgent public engagement.”

In addition to considerations about research that may blur the line between humans and animals, the work on monkeys raises issues about both animal welfare and human consent. While many “de-identified” human cells can be used in research without consent for specific experiments, that may not be the best approach for highly controversial experiments such as this one, she said.

Izpisua Belmonte and the other researchers agreed that ethical debate and guidelines for such work is critical. They said they discussed the work with ethicists before proceeding and received extensive review and approval from all scientific institutions involved. The paper’s discussion section starts not with scientific findings as is usual in a research paper, but with a statement about ethical considerations.

The researchers say animal-human chimeras could prove a powerful tool in biomedicine and that the new research is important for helping understand what roadblocks stand in the way of merging human cells into animal embryos. Their hope is to understand the principles in monkey-human chimeras, which seem easier to create, and then try to apply that knowledge to the more technically challenging but ethically more acceptable pig-human chimeras.

The researchers, and other scientists STAT contacted for comment, said one of the most exciting things about the new paper was the discovery of “crosstalk” between human and monkey cells in the developing embryo, something that did not occur so readily in human-pig chimeras. “Human cells in pig tissue is akin to communications between two distant languages, such as Chinese and French, whereas human cells in macaques is like communications between two closely related languages, like Spanish and French,” said Izpisua Belmonte. “We do think understanding interspecific cross-talk could be the key for generating more successful chimeras.”

One major goal, they say, is to find a way to grow human organs in pigs or other animals to ease the shortage for transplants. Currently, more than 100,000 Americans are awaiting organs for transplant. But some scientists question whether that goal is achievable given how hard the research has proven so far.

“How realistic is it to think that someday this line of research could actually be able to produce organs for transplants into human patients?” asked Paul Knoepfler, a stem cell scientist and professor at the UC Davis School of Medicine. “If that is extremely unlikely given technical challenges, even setting aside ethical considerations, how much further should this research be pushed just to advance our knowledge of human development?”

Knoepfler said the research posed a host of other questions as well. “Is there a point at which a chimera is “too human”? For instance, what if a monkey-human chimera ended up being more human than monkey, should special rules apply?” he asked. “What if there are many human cells in the developing brain of a chimera?”

The issue of the brain merits special consideration, in part because many consider the brain the organ that makes humans unique. Because of these considerations, the National Academy of Sciences convened a group to weigh in on the ethics and governance of the emerging field of neural organoids, transplants, and chimeras. The report, released earlier this month, stated that many ethical issues in the field could be addressed by existing mechanisms, but that it was critical to continually reassess concerns as the science developed.

The Cell paper is interesting, said the report committee’s co-chair, Joshua Sanes, a neuroscientist and professor of molecular and cell biology at Harvard, but it is not pertinent to a discussion about neural chimeras because the less-than-3-week-old embryos had not reached the point of having a nervous system. Still, he said the new work reinforced the committee’s urging that ethical conversations “get ahead of the curve.”

“It’s pretty clear the entire field is moving ahead with great rapidity,” Sanes said. “It’s not clear how fast it will go, or in which direction, but we do need to revisit these issues regularly.”

Work is already afoot to loosen internationally recognized ethical limits that prohibit scientists from growing any human embryo outside the body for longer than 14 days. The rule had been in place for decades, and was developed in a time when it was technologically impossible to keep embryos alive outside the body for more than a few days. But that’s changed dramatically in recent years, and with increased interest in powerful gene editing tools such as CRISPR to genetically modify embryos to cure disease, motivation is strong to push biological limits further — and to have clear guidelines about what may be going too far.

Said Knoepfler: “Leaving it up to every researcher and institutional ethics review board to entirely come up with their own rules on human embryo research seems to me like a recipe for big trouble.”",1876,11582,7,62
0,Eritrea confirms its troops are fighting in Ethiopia’s Tigray,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/17/eritrea-confirms-its-troops-are-fighting-ethiopias-tigray,"For months, both sides denied Eritreans were involved, contradicting testimony from residents, rights groups, aid workers, and diplomats.

Eritrea has acknowledged for the first time its forces are taking part in the months-long war in Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region and promised to pull them out in the face of mounting international pressure.

The explicit admission of Eritrea’s role in the fighting came in a letter posted online late on Friday by the country’s information minister, written by its ambassador to the United Nations and addressed to the Security Council.

Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed sent troops into Tigray in November last year to disarm and detain leaders of the region’s once-dominant political party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF).

For months, the Ethiopian and Eritrean governments denied Eritreans were involved, contradicting testimony from residents, rights groups, aid workers, diplomats and even some Ethiopian civilian and military officials. Tigray residents have repeatedly accused Eritrean forces of mass rape and massacres, including in the towns of Axum and Dengolat.

Abiy finally acknowledged the Eritreans’ presence in March while speaking to MPs, and promised soon after that they would leave.

Friday’s letter from Eritrea said, with the TPLF “largely thwarted”, Asmara and Addis Ababa “have agreed – at the highest levels – to embark on the withdrawal of the Eritrean forces and the simultaneous redeployment of Ethiopian contingents along the international boundary”.

It came a day after UN aid chief Mark Lowcock told the Security Council that despite Abiy’s earlier promise, there had been no evidence of a withdrawal of Eritrean troops from the region.

He also said aid workers “continue to report new atrocities which they say are being committed by Eritrean Defence Forces”.

‘Increasing international presure’

William Davison, the International Crisis Group’s (ICG) senior analyst for Ethiopia, told Al Jazeera that Eritrea’s admission came as in recent weeks increasing proof made it harder to continue denying the presence of its forces in Tigray.

“Obviously, with that mounting evidence [came] increasing international pressure,” he said.

“Ethiopia’s government admitted the Eritrean presence and said they would withdraw and Eritrea said nothing; that did lead to suspicions that there was a difference between the two governments who are allies in this conflict in Tigray, so perhaps Eritrea’s government also wanted to dispel the idea that there was any major split between Addis Ababa and Asmara.”

Looking ahead, Davison said it was a matter of the international community to monitor “very carefully” whether the Eritrean troops will indeed leave Tigray.

“[That is] because, of course, up until now, the two governments have completely denied Eritrea’s presence. So therefore, there’s no particular reason to take them at their word that this withdrawal commitment will be implemented.”

Eritrea and Ethiopia blame the conflict on TPLF-orchestrated attacks on federal army camps in early November and describe it as a campaign to restore law and order. he TPLF says Abiy’s government and its longtime foe Eritrea launched a “coordinated attack” against it.

The conflict arrived in the middle of the harvest in Tigray and for months humanitarian access was greatly restricted, prompting fears of widespread starvation.

In his comments on Thursday, the UN’s Lowcock said he had received a report of 150 people dying of hunger in one area of southern Tigray, calling it “a sign of what lies ahead if more action is not taken”.

Ethiopian state media on Friday night aired a report denouncing the claim as “false” and “aimed at tarnishing the image of the country”.",636,4099,9,61

Oueremi had faced 24 charges of mass murder, rape, and inhumane and degrading treatment over the violence in Duekoue, which occurred as Ivory Coast was in the grip of a post-election civil war.

The Red Cross says 817 people were killed in one day in Duekoue, while the UN puts the toll at 300.

Oueremi's lawyer said he did not deny the massacres, but that he was under the command of rebel chiefs.

Ivory Coast's cocoa-producing western region was the worst-hit during the 2010-11 post-election crisis.

Then president Laurent Gbagbo was eventually forced out of office after refusing to accept defeat by the current president, Alassane Ouattara.

The months-long conflict claimed some 3,000 lives and split the country along north-south lines.

Oueremi, 57, was head of a militia that fought alongside pro-Ouattara rebels against rival groups and forces loyal to Gbagbo, which have also been accused of atrocities.

According to the UN and other international organisations, the capture of Duekoue in March 2011 by pro-Ouattara fighters was accompanied by large-scale massacres.

The trial began on March 24 and has notably featured testimony from women who spoke of their husbands and other relatives being brutally killed in front of them.

In fact, after being treated for multiple lacerations and broken ribs, Mr. Durell has been discharged from the ER and is already back at work sweeping up the broken glass.” Durell later became the first American to receive his follow-up dose of the vaccine when he reportedly slipped on a puddle of his own blood, fell backward into a shelving unit, and knocked over several dozen syringes that impaled his legs, chest, and face.

0,#IAmHongKonger campaign looks to assert Hong Kongers’ identity in Canadian census,https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2021/04/14/iamhongkonger-campaign-looks-to-assert-hong-kongers-identity-in-canadian-census.html,"A social media campaign has been launched to encourage Hong Kongers and their descendants in Canada to mark themselves as such in the next Canadian census.

Through the hashtag #IAmHongKonger on Twitter and Instagram, Canadians with close ties to the former British colony are being asked to “stand up for their own identity” in the Canadian population survey that starts next month.

“Hong Kongers have a different culture; we have a different language. We want to show that we exist. I feel like my identity is under threat and being erased,” said Crispin Chow, 22, a campaign organizer.

“They can do this by marking ‘Hong Kong’ down as their ethnic origin in the long-form census and listing ‘Cantonese’ as one of their spoken languages at home in the short-form.”

According to Canada’s 2016 census, there are at least 215,775 Hong Kong-born immigrants residing in Canada, but no official figures track those of Hong Kong ethnic or cultural descent, according to the campaign.

That’s because they are currently marked as “Chinese” in the census, unless they specify otherwise in the blank space, though the questionnaire does ask for the respondent’s country of birth as well as ancestors’ ethnic or cultural origin.

Those who checked the box as South Asians, for instance, can specify if they are East Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan or others.

The #IAmHongKonger organizers said the Canadian government has yet to officially recognize Hong Kongers’ identity. Without reliable statistics, organizers said, service providers, policy-makers and community organizations are unable to serve the needs of this unique population.

The drive couldn’t have come at a more sensitive time in the Canada-China relationship, with Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor still held by Beijing while Chinese Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou is awaiting the outcome of her potential extradition to the U.S. from Canada.

Some Hong Kongers have long complained about the forced assimilation with Mainland Chinese since the island’s takeover by China in 1997, and many Canadians with dual citizenship in Hong Kong are returning to Canada in the wake of Beijing’s national security law, which was passed last year and which many view as an attempt to stifle opposition voices and suppress freedoms.

Chow, a University of Waterloo student, said the campaign started off with a group of friends chatting about the upcoming census and their shared desire to assert their identity as Hong Kongers. They then spread the ideas among their network of friends.

He said none of the organizers have any political affiliation and they don’t want the public to think that the campaign is politically motivated to target the Chinese government.

“We know that it could be a problem, but at the end of the day, we can fill out as many ethnic origins as you identify yourself,” said Chow, who was born in Canada but grew up in Hong Kong. “We are only speaking for ourselves.”

Born to a Canadian parent in Hong Kong, Maya Lee returned to Canada only five years ago and said she strongly feels her identity as a Hong Konger rather than just as ethnic Chinese.

“Hong Kongers have a very unique identity. We have a very different culture, a different language. We want to show the rest of the world that Hong Konger identity does exist,” said the 22-year-old University of Toronto student, who self-identifies as a Canadian and Hong Konger.

“For our community, it’s very difficult to be lumped into the Pan-Asian or Chinese group, because our food and traditions are so different. Most of the time, our community feels very unseen. It’s almost like a slow erasure and loss of our identity.”

The campaign aims to enhance Hong Kong Canadians’ civic participation and strengthen their Hong Konger identity and to unite the diaspora in Canada.

The objectives struck a chord with Sybil Tong, whose family moved to Canada in 1998 when she was a toddler. Raised in Markham, she said she is very familiar with Hong Kong culture and traditions, which are the products of its unique history.

“It’s a mix of eastern and western. We have our own language and own food, and everything that would make any culture its own,” said Tong, 25, an urban planner.

“Our identity is something that should always be on the forefront. It goes beyond the census. If we identify as Hong Kongers, that’s something Canada should take note of. Diversity is our strength.”

Prime Minister Andrej Babis said in an emergency press conference on April 17 that the decision to expel the diplomats was made on the basis of ""unequivocal evidence"" provided by investigators from the Czech intelligence and security services, and that there was ""reasonable suspicion regarding a role of members of Russian military intelligence GRU's unit 29155 in the explosion of the munition depot in Vrbetice in 2014.""



Babis said that the blast in the country's eastern Zlin region, near the Czech-Slovak border, ""inflicted immense material damage, seriously endangered and disrupted the lives of many local residents, and, most importantly, killed two of our citizens -- unsuspecting, innocent fathers of their families.""

As a sovereign state, Babis said, the Czech Republic ""must react to these unprecedented revelations in a corresponding manner.""



The explosion October 16, 2014, blast in Vrbetice set off 50 metric tons of stored ammunition. Two months later, another blast of 13 tons of ammunition occurred at the same site.



Interior Minister Jan Hamacek said that all diplomats in the Russian Embassy who had been identified as intelligence operatives had been ordered to leave the Czech Republic within 48 hours.



Czech police announced the same day that they were searching for two suspected Russian agents carrying various passports, including Russian documents in the names of Aleksandr Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov.

The names match those of suspects in the poisonings of former Russian intelligence agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury, England, in 2018. Both Skripals survived the attack carried out using the banned Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok.



Russia has denied any involvement in the poisonings.



An investigation by Bellingcat later identified the suspects as Aleksandr Mishkin and Anatoly Chepiga.

Hamacek said the situation would significantly harm Czech-Russian relations, saying, ""We’re in a similar situation like Britain in the attempted poisoning case in Salisbury.”

A representative of the Russian Embassy in Prague confirmed to Interfax that it had been informed of the expulsions and that Russian Ambassador Aleksandr Zmeyevsky had been summoned to the Czech Foreign Ministry.

Moscow warned about consequences in a response to the expulsions from the Russian Foreign Ministry.



""Prague is well aware of what comes after such hocus-pocus,"" spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said, according to Interfax.



Vladimir Japarov, first deputy chairman of the Federation Council’s International Affairs Committee, told the state news agency TASS that any reaction ""should be proportionate.""



Following Babis's announcement, the U.S. Embassy in Prague tweeted that “the United States stands with its steadfast ally, the Czech Republic. We appreciate their significant action to impose costs on Russia for its dangerous actions on Czech soil.”

The accusations stem from anti-government tweets he posted after the self-immolation death of journalist Irina Slavina after police searches at her apartment in October.

A Moscow court has sentenced one of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny’s allies to two years in prison for two tweets critical of the Russian government, the Mediazona news website reported Thursday.

Moscow’s Tushinsky District Court found Zelensky guilty of incitement and sentenced him to two years in a penal colony, according to the Mediazona independent news website.

The state prosecution had reportedly requested a 2.5-year sentence for Zelensky.

Zelensky's wife told the Open Media news website that he plans to appeal the verdict.

Mediazona reported that Zelensky had pleaded guilty, with other Navalny allies speculating that officials may have subjected him to physical and psychological pressure to do so. Zelensky's wife had told Mediazona in February that he pleaded guilty in hopes of mitigating his sentence after he learned his mother was sick with the coronavirus.

The outlet added that Interior Ministry experts found signs of extremism in Zelensky’s tweets, one of which called for readers to take to the streets to express their anger.

Navalny and FBK have been a constant thorn in the side of Russian officials, several of whom have found themselves the subjects of the group's popular video investigations alleging high-level corruption. Several Navalny allies are under house arrest on charges of violating coronavirus restrictions for urging protests calling for Navalny’s release earlier this year.

Rights groups have accused Russia of applying the extremist label to opposition material as it increasingly criminalized online content in recent years.

Navalny, 44, is serving two and a half years in a notorious prison colony on charges of violating parole of his old suspended sentence for fraud. He is currently on hunger strike to demand proper medical treatment.

Jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny is at increasing risk of kidney failure and his vision is deteriorating after more than two weeks on hunger strike, a medical trade union with ties to the opposition politician said on Saturday.

Navalny, 44, a prominent opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin, started refusing food on March 31 in protest at what he said was the refusal of prison authorities to treat him properly for acute back and leg pain.

""His condition is indeed critical,"" said Alexandra Zakharova, a representative of the Doctors Alliance trade union - a group that Russian authorities regard as opposition activists.

She cited tests obtained through Navalny's lawyers, saying members of the union had not examined him themselves.

""We have seen the tests, and they are very, very bad,"" she told Reuters.

""His potassium is high and he has other high readings which indicate that his kidneys may soon fail. This would lead to severe pathology and cardiac arrest may occur,"" she added.

Russia jailed Navalny for two-and-a-half years in February for parole violations he said were trumped up. He was arrested at the border as he returned to Russia from Germany where he had been recovering from a nerve agent poisoning.

About 80 famous writers, actors, historians, journalists and directors, including authors JK Rowling and Salman Rushdie, wrote an open letter to Putin on Friday, urging him to ensure Navalny gets the urgent medical care he needs.

Prison authorities say they have offered Navalny proper treatment, but that he has refused it and insists he should be treated by a doctor of his choice from outside the facility, a request they have declined.

Navalny said on Friday that prison authorities had threatened to put him in a straitjacket to force-feed him unless he abandons his hunger strike.

REUTERS/Sam Mircovich/File Photo

The United States hopes to restore its shattered credibility when it hosts a climate change summit next week by pledging to cut its greenhouse emissions by at least half and securing agreements from allies for faster reductions, according to two sources familiar with the matter.

A 50% reduction from 2005 levels by 2030 is a minimum level urged by environmental groups, hundreds of corporations and European Union lawmakers. It would be the first upgrade of the U.S. climate target since 2015, when former President Barack Obama pledged a 26%-28% reduction by 2025.

Washington was also close to clinching deals with the governments of Japan, South Korea and Canada to accelerate their targets to decarbonize, the two sources said. It was not immediately clear if those nations would make announcements at the event, and representatives of those countries have not commented on the discussions.

The stakes for the meeting are high. Leaders from roughly 40 countries including China, India, Brazil and Russia have been invited, with hopes they will double down on past pledges to reduce climate warming emissions. So far, international pledges to decarbonize would shave only 1% off global emissions by 2030 compared with 2010 levels, a fraction of what scientists say is needed to avert the worst impacts of climate change.

The virtual summit on April 22-23, kicking off on Earth Day, will be an opportunity for Democratic President Joe Biden to reclaim U.S. leadership in global climate efforts, after four years during which his predecessor, Republican Donald Trump, downplayed the issue to support the oil and coal industries.

Biden's climate envoy, John Kerry, has spent the last few months on countless Zoom appearances and on a globe-hopping tour, concluding this week in China and South Korea, to persuade countries to use next week's summit to hike their commitments to protect the planet.

The Biden administration has been laying the groundwork for its new target, unveiling a $2 trillion infrastructure package to expand clean energy and transport. read more

The European Union last year agreed to reduce its net emissions at least 55% by 2030 from 1990 levels - currently the most ambitious among big emitters.

""All eyes are on the Biden summit next week as a key moment for John Kerry’s diplomatic skills to be put to work in aligning all countries with a halving of emissions in this decade, as science demands,"" said Christiana Figueres, former executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

PATIENCE WEARING THIN

Next week's U.S. summit is the first in a string of meetings of world leaders - including the G7 and G20 - ahead of the United Nations climate summit in November, known as COP26. That serves as the deadline for nearly 200 countries to update their climate pledges under the Paris Agreement, an international accord set in 2015 to combat global warming.

But as global powers tussle over percentage points, in countries already facing the impacts of a warming world, patience is wearing thin.

Developing countries – many of which are vulnerable to rising seas, heatwaves and rainfall made more severe by climate change – are expected to offer their own goals at the summit, said Pablo Vieira, director of the NDC Partnership, which has been helping developing nations craft their climate targets.

They will also repeat their demand that rich nations offer more money to help them cut emissions and adapt to the impacts it is already unleashing in countries like Bangladesh, South Sudan and the Marshall Islands.

YOU'RE ALL INVITED

U.S. talks with Japan, South Korea and Canada have focused on trying to get each country to commit to cut emissions at least 50% by 2030, according to the two sources familiar with the U.S. negotiations.

Japan and South Korea both rely on coal for power generation and winding that dependence down and their finance of coal plants abroad could yield significant emissions cuts in the next 10 years, the sources said.

Canada may have a tougher challenge.

""We don’t have quite that luxury here because coal is a much smaller part of our grid,"" Canada's Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said. But he added: ""We are working to stretch as far as we can.”

Canada, which has a large oil industry, currently has a target to cut emissions 30% below 2005 levels by 2030.

Other major emitters appear less keen to take the plunge, including India, China, Brazil and Russia.

India, the third-largest emitting country behind China and the United States, is resisting because it expects more developed nations to take on the bulk of global reductions.

“What we are suffering today is caused a 100 years ago,” said Prakash Javadekar, India’s Minister of Environment, Forest & Climate Change, pointing to emissions from the United States and Europe. “Historical responsibility is a very important aspect. We cannot just forget it.”

China’s special climate envoy, Xie Zhenhua, was meeting with Kerry in Shanghai this week to discuss climate change, the foreign ministry said. China promised last year that its greenhouse gas output would peak by 2030, a target environmental groups say is insufficient.

U.S. and Brazilian officials, meanwhile, have been working since February on a billion-dollar deal to fund Brazil's protection of the Amazon rainforest, but diplomatic sources said a deal is unlikely by April 22.

Russia, another big emitter, has not yet confirmed if President Vladimir Putin will participate in the summit. With Moscow's ties with the West at a post-Cold War low, the U.S. summit has generated little buzz in Russia.

The Reconstruction Agency on Tuesday released a flyer and video on its website featuring the radioactive substance tritium as a cute character to dispel concerns about the government’s decision, but they were removed Wednesday night following the criticism.

“Nuclear power plants are highly specialized and difficult to understand. We want many people to take an interest in them,” said an agency official, adding the mascot would be redesigned in line with the views of the public.

According to the official, advertising giant Dentsu Inc., which was contracted by the agency for the campaign, commissioned an illustrator to create the mascot.

The Japanese government decided Tuesday to release treated radioactive water from Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc.’s Fukushima plant into the Pacific Ocean from 2023.

The water is being treated using an advanced liquid processing system (ALPS), which removes most radioactive materials including strontium and cesium but leaves behind tritium, an isotope of hydrogen said to pose little health risk in low concentrations.

“It seems the government’s desire to release the water into the sea takes priority over everything. We fishermen can’t understand it,” said Katsuo Watanabe, an 82-year-old fisherman from Iwaki, Fukushima Prefecture.

Riken Komatsu, 41, a writer involved in reconstruction activities in Iwaki, tweeted, “If (the government) thinks it can get the general public to understand just by creating a cute character, it is making a mockery of risk communication.”

Komatsu told Kyodo News that local fishermen are doing all they can to fight against the release of the water containing tritium into the sea, with many Fukushima residents trying their best to suppress their anger.

“The gap between the gravity of the problems we face and the levity of the character is huge,” he said.

Opponents of Myanmar's junta announced a National Unity Government on Friday including ousted members of parliament and leaders of anti-coup protests and ethnic minorities, saying their aim was to end military rule and restore democracy.

Myanmar has been in turmoil since the Feb. 1 coup that ousted a civilian government led by democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi which had held power for five years and was starting its second term after a landslide election victory in November.

People have taken to the streets day after day to demand the restoration of democracy, defying crackdowns by the security forces in which more than 700 people have been killed, according to a monitoring group.

At the same time, political leaders, including ousted members of parliament from Suu Kyi's party, have been trying to organize to show the country and the outside world that they and not the generals are the legitimate political authority.

""Please welcome the people's government,"" veteran democracy activist Min Ko Naing said in a 10-minute video address announcing the formation of the National Unity Government (NUG).

While setting out few positions, Min Ko Naing said the will of the people was the unity government's priority, while acknowledging the scale of the task at hand.

""We're trying to get this out from the roots so we have to sacrifice a lot,"" he said, referring to the junta.

A spokesman for the junta could not be reached for comment.

The generals justified their takeover with accusations of fraud in the November election won by Suu Kyi's party, though the election commission dismissed the objections.

One of the unity government's primary objectives will be to win international support and recognition.

""We are the democratically elected leaders of Myanmar,"" said the unity government's minister of international cooperation, Dr Sasa, who goes by one name.

""So if the free and democratic world rejects us that means they reject democracy.""

International pressure has been building on the Myanmar military, particularly from Western governments that have imposed limited sanctions, though the generals have a long record of dismissing what they see as outside interference.

The unity government released a list of office holders including members of ethnic minorities and protest leaders, underlining the unity of purpose between the pro-democracy movement and autonomy-seeking minority communities, some of whom have battled the central government for decades.

CLAPPING IN THE DARK

Suu Kyi, who has been in detention since the coup, was listed as state counsellor, the post she held in government.

The only known communication she has had with the outside world since the coup has been monitored video calls with her lawyers.

A spokesman for the democratic politicians said while they could not inform her about their new government, he was sure she was aware of what was happening.

Sasa told Reuters the objective was to end violence, restore democracy and build a ""federal democratic union"". The military, while playing lip service to the idea of federalism, has long seen itself as the core power holding the country together.

Unity government leaders said they intended to form a federal army and were in talks with ethnic minority forces.

The Special Advisory Council for Myanmar, a group of international experts including former United Nations officials, hailed the creation of the NUG as historic and said it was the legitimate government.

After darkness fell over Myanmar's biggest city Yangon, people clapped at their windows and chanted ""our government"", video posted by activists on Twitter showed. Some community groups reported the sound of explosions and gunfire shortly afterwards.

While the politicians were announcing the unity government, other opponents of military rule observed a ""silent strike"" staying home to mourn those killed or wearing black in small marches in half a dozen cities and towns, media reported.

Yangon's streets were largely deserted, residents said.

There were no immediate reports of violence at Friday's rallies.

The military has also been rounding up critics and state media announced arrest warrants for 20 doctors on charges of encouraging dissent in the armed forces. The junta is seeking more than 200 people, including several internet celebrities, actors and singers, on the same change.

The turmoil has alarmed Myanmar's neighbors in Southeast Asia who have been trying to encourage talks between the rival sides.

Leaders of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which includes Myanmar, will meet in Indonesia on April 24 to discuss the situation, Thai and Indonesian media reported.

Junta leader Senior General Min Aung Hlaing was due to attend, a Thai broadcaster said, but the Jakarta Post said it had not been confirmed whether the summit would include representatives of the junta or the former government.

Sasa said ASEAN should not invite ""murderer-in-chief"" Min Aung Hlaing.",812,5149,35,236

The Ukrainian navy has threatened to shoot at Russian FSB security service patrol ships in a worrying flashpoint amid fears a war could be sparked between the nations.

In the latest of several spats, five Federal Security Service vessels carried out “provocative manoeuvres” in the Azov Sea around three Gyurza-M-class artillery boats of Ukraine’s navy.

“In response to the threats from the Russian vessels, our sailors had to warn of a readiness to use weapons,” said Andrii Klymenko, editor of Black Sea News.

After the Kyiv sailors issued the threat to shoot, they were allowed to proceed, he said.

There are fears Russia is seeking to provoke a response from Ukraine which may act as a catalyst to a wider conflict and even full scale war.

Vladimir Putin is projected to have 115,000 troops in place by early next week.

It comes as Ukraine has warned that it could unilaterally build a nuclear arsenal if NATO refuses to permit it membership of the Western military alliance.

It was formerly a nuclear state with 176 ICBMs and 44 strategic bombers after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and agreed to eliminate its weaponry in return for legally-binding security guarantees from Britain, the US and Russia.

“We must do everything possible to ensure that Putin will not attack us tomorrow or the day after tomorrow,” said Andriy Melnik, Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany.

“The only possibility for this is for Ukraine to finally become a NATO member.

“If Ukraine were a NATO member in 2014... it would never have come to the annexation and this terrible war in the east,” he said.

He warned bluntly: ”Ukraine has no other choice, either we are part of an alliance such as NATO and are doing our part to make this Europe stronger, or we have the only option: to arm by ourselves, and maybe think about nuclear status again.

“How else can we guarantee our defence?”

In a plea for the West to bolster its security guarantees, he said: “Almost 90,000 [Russian] servicemen, as well as their armed systems were pulled to the border and to the region of occupied Crimea and Donbas.

“This deployment is not just muscle flexing.

“We are dealing with the largest troop movement in Russia since the Second World War.”

Russian state-owned Sputnik news agency said in a report that Ukraine “likely retains the technical capability to build a nuclear arsenal”.

But it said: “The state of its civilian nuclear power programme leaves something to be desired.

“Last year, Ukrainian nuclear industry workers sounded the alarm about the threat of ‘another Chernobyl’ citing a ‘dire situation’ which they said was ‘taking shape in the country's nuclear energy sector’ due to a lack of oversight, safety permits, and funds.”

Kyiv warned strongly over the threat of the Azov Sea tension escalating into a major incident.

""Russia continues to violate international law,” said the Ukrainian navy.

""Russia's FSB made yet another attempt to hinder the lawful actions of a Ukrainian Navy boat group on combat duty.

“The Ukrainian navy's tactical boat group proceeded with its mission despite Russian provocations and deliberate efforts to restrict free navigation.”

On Thursday, Ukraine issued a protest over Russia's decision to bar foreign warships and state vessels from parts of the Black Sea in the direction of the Kerch Strait from next week until October.

Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry said: ""Such actions by the Russian Federation are another attempt, in violation of the norms and principles of international law, at usurping [our] sovereign rights as a littoral state.

“It is Ukraine that has the right to regulate navigation in these parts of the Black Sea.”

There were claims that satellite images show Russia has installed in Crimea S-400 anti-aircraft systems with a range of 250 miles, according to Information Navigator.

This allows “the Russian occupation forces to control almost all the airspace of the Black Sea”.

Deadly car crash under investigation in Spring

Herman said authorities believe no one else was in the car and that it burst into flames immediately. He said it he believes it wasn’t being driven by a human.

Harris County Constable Precinct 4 deputies said the vehicle was traveling at a high speed when it failed to negotiate a cul-de-sac turn, ran off the road and hit the tree.

KPRC 2 reporter Deven Clarke spoke to one man’s brother-in-law who said he was taking the car out for a spin with his best friend, so there were just two in the vehicle.

The owner, he said, backed out of the driveway, and then may have hopped in the back seat only to crash a few hundred yards down the road. He said the owner was found in the back seat upright.

The brother-in-law of one of the victims said relatives watched the car burn for four hours as authorities tried to tap out the flames.

Authorities said they used 32,000 gallons of water to extinguish the flames because the vehicle’s batteries kept reigniting. At one point, Herman said, deputies had to call Tesla to ask them how to put out the fire in the battery.

0,"Leading European Football Clubs Announce New ""Super League"" Competition",https://thesuperleague.com/press.html,"LEADING EUROPEAN FOOTBALL CLUBS ANNOUNCE NEW SUPER LEAGUE COMPETITION

Twelve of Europe’s leading football clubs have today come together to announce they have agreed to establish a new mid-week competition, the Super League, governed by its Founding Clubs.

AC Milan, Arsenal FC, Atlético de Madrid, Chelsea FC, FC Barcelona, FC Internazionale Milano, Juventus FC, Liverpool FC, Manchester City, Manchester United, Real Madrid CF and Tottenham Hotspur have all joined as Founding Clubs. It is anticipated that a further three clubs will join ahead of the inaugural season, which is intended to commence as soon as practicable.

Going forward, the Founding Clubs look forward to holding discussions with UEFA and FIFA to work together in partnership to deliver the best outcomes for the new League and for football as a whole.

The formation of the Super League comes at a time when the global pandemic has accelerated the instability in the existing European football economic model. Further, for a number of years, the Founding Clubs have had the objective of improving the quality and intensity of existing European competitions throughout each season, and of creating a format for top clubs and players to compete on a regular basis.

The pandemic has shown that a strategic vision and a sustainable commercial approach are required to enhance value and support for the benefit of the entire European football pyramid. In recent months extensive dialogue has taken place with football stakeholders regarding the future format of European competitions. The Founding Clubs believe the solutions proposed following these talks do not solve fundamental issues, including the need to provide higher-quality matches and additional financial resources for the overall football pyramid.

Competition Format

20 participating clubs with 15 Founding Clubs and a qualifying mechanism for a further five teams to qualify annually based on achievements in the prior season.

Midweek fixtures with all participating clubs continuing to compete in their respective national leagues, preserving the traditional domestic match calendar which remains at the heart of the club game.

An August start with clubs participating in two groups of ten, playing home and away fixtures, with the top three in each group automatically qualifying for the quarter finals. Teams finishing fourth and fifth will then compete in a two-legged play-off for the remaining quarter-final positions. A two-leg knockout format will be used to reach the final at the end of May, which will be staged as a single fixture at a neutral venue.

As soon as practicable after the start of the men’s competition, a corresponding women’s league will also be launched, helping to advance and develop the women’s game.

The new annual tournament will provide significantly greater economic growth and support for European football via a long-term commitment to uncapped solidarity payments which will grow in line with league revenues. These solidarity payments will be substantially higher than those generated by the current European competition and are expected to be in excess of €10 billion during the course of the initial commitment period of the Clubs. In addition, the competition will be built on a sustainable financial foundation with all Founding Clubs signing up to a spending framework. In exchange for their commitment, Founding Clubs will receive an amount of €3.5 billion solely to support their infrastructure investment plans and to offset the impact of the COVID pandemic.

Florentino Pérez, President Real Madrid CF and the first Chairman of the Super League said:

“We will help football at every level and take it to its rightful place in the world. Football is the only global sport in the world with more than four billion fans and our responsibility as big clubs is to respond to their desires.”

Backing the new European league, Andrea Agnelli, Chairman of Juventus and Vice-Chairman of the Super League said:

“Our 12 Founder clubs represent billions of fans across the globe and 99 European trophies. We have come together at this critical moment, enabling European competition to be transformed, putting the game we love on a sustainable footing for the long-term future, substantially increasing solidarity, and giving fans and amateur players a regular flow of headline fixtures that will feed their passion for the game while providing them with engaging role models.”

Joel Glazer, Co-Chairman of Manchester United and Vice-Chairman of the Super League said:

“By bringing together the world’s greatest clubs and players to play each other throughout the season, the Super League will open a new chapter for European football, ensuring world-class competition and facilities, and increased financial support for the wider football pyramid.”",754,4828,9,71
0,China scolds Canada over Parliament's support of Halifax Security Forum award to Taiwan,https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/15/china-canada-taiwan-award-481912,"Canada's MPs weigh in: A nonbinding motion, adopted unanimously Wednesday by MPs, called President Tsai Ing-wen a “well-respected international leader, female president of Taiwan and a strong global advocate for democracy.” The statement, introduced by Conservative MP Michael Chong, also said she would “certainly be an ideal fit” for the Halifax International Security Forum's signature award.

The development came a few days after POLITICO reported that Canadian officials told organizers of the forum that Canada would withdraw its support for the event if its flagship John McCain Prize for Leadership in Public Service went to Tsai. Canada is a top sponsor of the forum.

The parliamentary motion also directed the Canadian government to maintain its funding for the defense forum at current levels, even if Tsai were to receive the John McCain Prize.

Trudeau's challenge: The timing is complicated for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has been trying for more than two years to secure the release of two Canadians he says are arbitrarily imprisoned in China on “trumped-up” charges.

Canada-China diplomatic relations nose-dived after the arrest of Huawei senior executive Meng Wanzhou at Vancouver’s airport in December 2018 on a U.S. extradition warrant. Beijing has called the move political and demanded her release.

Meng, whose father founded the Chinese telecom giant, is accused of breaking U.S. international sanctions against Iran. She has denied any wrongdoing and is fighting extradition.

Days after Meng’s arrest, Chinese authorities seized Canadians Michael Kovrig, a diplomat on leave, and Michael Spavor, an entrepreneur. The men were tried separately last month on espionage charges and are awaiting their verdicts and, very likely, their sentences.

The global context: Much like the U.S., Canada’s “One China” policy means Ottawa doesn’t recognize Taiwan as a sovereign state, nor does it maintain official relations with Taiwanese government.

In recent months, Beijing has targeted Taiwan with a hybrid warfare campaign, including election interference, cyberattacks and drone intrusions into its airspace. The offensive has hurt the Taiwanese economy and fed fears of a full-blown invasion.

The HFX controversy: The Trudeau government, which has shied away from provoking Beijing since the Kovrig and Spavor arrests, appeared uncomfortable with such an award being given to Tsai at an Ottawa-sponsored conference in Canada.

Multiple sources familiar with the matter told POLITICO that HFX organizers decided to give the 2020 award to Tsai. Cindy McCain, a member of the forum’s board of directors, backed the decision to honor Tsai with the prize named after her late husband.

The forum’s website says the John McCain Prize is bestowed annually to individuals from any country “who have demonstrated uncommon leadership in the pursuit of human justice.”

When Canadian officials were told of the plan, sources say they made it clear if the award went to Tsai, the Canadian government would pull its support — and funding — from the forum.

Committee crossfire: Canadian Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan’s office initially declined to deny or confirm POLITICO’s report.

But on Monday, while under questioning by a parliamentary committee, Sajjan denied that the Trudeau government threatened to withhold funding over the organizers’ plan for the award.

Sajjan also declined to answer when pressed by his Conservative opponents to say if he would endorse Tsai for such a prize. The minister said that HFX is independent and free to make its own decisions when it comes to awards.

When asked whether he would commit to maintaining financial support for the forum regardless of who received its prizes, Sajjan would only say that he would take a look at the funding request as he does every year.

The PM's reponse: Each day this week, Trudeau’s Liberal government has been questioned about the HFX story in the House of Commons.

Before the vote on the motion, Trudeau himself was pressed Wednesday by Chong to commit to maintaining HFX funding, even if organizers awarded the John McCain Prize to Tsai.

0,An Ecosystem on the Rise: The Future of Cloud Kitchens in the Philippines,https://www.esquiremag.ph/money/industry/the-future-of-cloud-kitchens-in-the-philippines-a00304-20210415-lfrm?ref=home_featured_big,"The global F&B industry continues to grapple with the effects of the pandemic and lockdown, but one innovation that’s slowly gaining ground is the cloud kitchen, a new model that disrupting and saving how we serve food.

Cloud kitchens have been popping up around the world, with China reportedly having the most out of any country. The Philippine cloud kitchen ecosystem is still in its infancy stage, yet local startups like CloudEats and MadEats have already bagged millions of pesos in investments. Other notable players include GrabKitchen from the Grab app and the Mercato United Kitchen, created by and for the MSMEs that participated in the food market pre-lockdown. The Dubai cloud kitchen Kitopi is also looking to expand into the Southeast Asian region.

But one player that’s leading the herd is Kraver’s Canteen, a one-year-old startup that recently secured $1.5 million (about P72.7 million) in seed funding from Foxmont Capital Partners, JG Summit CEO Lance Gokongwei, co-founder of Grab Brian Cu, Co-founder of Zalora Paolo Campos III, Century Pacific chairman Christopher Po, and Rico’s Lechon president George Pua.

What is a cloud kitchen?

Think of it like a digital food court where customers can purchase food from more than one brand. This is made possible by the cloud kitchen model, which lets brands share one large kitchen, similar to a co-working space. Unlike a traditional brick-and-mortar establishment, cloud kitchens don’t have a dine-in or front-of-the-house function. It relies solely on deliveries, partnering with third-party delivery apps, which in the Philippines are mainly Grab, Foodpanda, and Pick-a-Roo.

Since cloud kitchens don’t have a dine-in area, they don’t require all the expenses that come with having a front-of-the-house, cutting costs drastically.

“You can actually open a cloud kitchen at 10 or 20 percent of the cost that it would take to build and entirely new establishment. Of course a big part of the expenses (of a brick-and-mortar restaurant) is the frontage, the branding, the dine-in [area]. But under the cloud kitchen model, you only need to work on the small kitchen area where you can only build things you need to service the customers,” explained Kraver’s Canteen co-founder and general manager Victor Lim to ANC.

Instead of building an entire shop, brands can rent a space in a cloud kitchen where cooks can store, cook, assemble, and deliver orders like clockwork.

Who benefits the most from a cloud kitchen?

Cloud kitchens serve both brands and customers. On the brand side, cloud kitchens offer online restaurants a growth opportunity to build their delivery base, which has been a lifeline for many in the F&B industry during the pandemic. This is particularly true for online restaurants that had to close during lockdown but found a second life operating from a cloud kitchen and making the full shift online.

The model also offers a chance for online-only food brands that were built by day-workers who decided to make a business in their free time. Instead of having to cook from home or set aside a huge sum to build a store, new food entrepreneur for trs can go the cloud kitchen route to build their customer base.

Major F&B players are also keen on entering the cloud kitchen ecosystem, such as Kraver’s Canteen’s newest brand partner: Bench Group. Bench’s Tonkatsu Maisen cloud kitchen recently launched with Kraver’s Canteen, which also plans to add 20 other major brands to their roster, including Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and Dairy Queen, all of which are under PPI Holdings Inc. of the Araneta Group.

As for the customers, cloud kitchens allow you to cross-order when you’re craving more than one cuisine or type of food. For example, you can order tacos from one brand and sushi from another but have both delivered together as they’re both cooked in the same cloud kitchen. This is particularly convenient if you’re hosting small get togethers and everyone wants a different thing. The added convenience is the only difference on the side of the customer, who only really care about the food they’re getting but not where it’s made.

“When you order, for example, Shakey’s, you don’t know if it’s coming from a mall, the food court, food truck or stand-alone restaurant. Cloud kitchens are just another aspect and channel for these brands to sell their brands. For the customer, it’s not about where it’s coming from but which brand it’s coming from,” explained Lim.

The Future of Cloud Kitchens

Cloud kitchens are the future of food, and there’s no doubt about it. While the concept existed pre-pandemic, it’s necessity was urged by lockdowns that forced the food industry to innovate. Cloud kitchens around the world have grown in number exponentially in the last few months, and it’s estimated that the global cloud kitchen market will grow at a CAGR of 12 percent from 2021 to 2027. In just six years, the market value of the industry is expected to be over $71.4 billion. That’s almost double its value from 2019, which was $43.1 billion.

“By our guess, the delivery and takeout market in the Philippines is somewhere between P4 billion to P5 billion dollars, so there’s certainly potential [in the industry],” said Lim.

Lockdown has only grown and nurtured the delivery culture, and it’s expected that takeout demand will remain stable even when the option to dine-in will return post-pandemic. The reasoning is simple: cloud kitchens weren’t made to replace restaurant stores, but to enhance the growth opportunities of food brands.

“As more customers begin to eat-out more and office life resumes, we’ll likely see a shift in customer behavior, yes, but overall expect minimal impact to sales. It’s important to remember that cloud kitchens are not designed to replace the brick-and-mortar experience, they are designed more as an expansion tool for brands to take advantage of the growing pie created by delivery aggregators,” said Eric Dee, co-founder of Kraver’s Canteen and president of Foodee Global Concepts.

“Ordering food online is a consumer behavior that is here to stay, and as long as customers are ordering, the cloud kitchen ecosystem will continue to grow. Whether consumers notice this or not, more of the food they order to their home or office will be coming from cloud kitchens over time.”

As major brands under Bench Group and Foodee adopt cloud kitchen options, so is mega-conglomerate Jollibee Food Corp., the country’s leading food enterprise. JFC has turned its attentions abroad as it aims to become one of the world’s top five restaurant brands, and its launching cloud kitchens internationally as part of its expansion plan. JFC has already opened cloud kitchens in Singapore and Chicago, and has allotted $138 million (P7 billion) to its global cloud kitchen initiative.

The regional state of cloud kitchens is also growing, with many new players emerging in Southeast Asia. In Indonesia where Gojek reigns supreme, the super app had partnered with Rebel Foods. GrabFood Indonesia has also partnered with cloud kitchen startup Yummy Corp. In Singapore, Smart City Kitchens, TiffinLabs, and Grain are popular cloud kitchen players. And in Malaysia, Cookhouse and Pop Meals are part of the cloud kitchen scene.

The Philippine cloud kitchen system is still in its early days, and to some, still “underdeveloped.” According to Lim, some local could kitchens are more focused on creating their own food brands than developing the ecosystem. So far, most cloud kitchens are still focused on the Metro Manila area. That could soon change as Kraver’s Canteen plans to build 100 cloud kitchens across the Philippines to service brands in major urban areas in the provinces, like Cebu, Cagayan de Oro, Iloilo, and Davao.

Soon, the digital food court could expand nationwide and help revive the struggling F&B industry.

0,Myanmar’s lost generation: nation’s youth sacrificing futures for freedom | Global development | The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/apr/15/myanmars-lost-generation-young-people-sacrifice-futures-for-freedom,"For Myanmar’s young people, 2021 was supposed to be a year for optimism. After seeing through the Covid-19 pandemic, the rollout of the vaccine had begun and general elections in November had marked a step towards the country realising its potential.

But in the wake of the 1 February coup, their dreams have turned into nightmares, as many of Myanmar’s young people have found themselves forced to sacrifice their futures to take a stand against the military.

Aspiring engineer, Hlyan Phyo Aung, 22, is one of them. News portal Myanmar Now reported that he was hurt by an explosion during a crackdown on a protest in the central city of Magway on 27 March. A soldier reportedly shot off his injured hand at close range, another shot multiple rubber bullets into his other hand, and then troops kicked him in the face until onlookers flung themselves over him, saving his life.

His right hand was amputated at the wrist; he may also permanently lose the use of his left hand. His left leg was shot eight times and may also be amputated, his right thigh has two bullet wounds, his face was battered and damage to his eyesight caused by the impact of the gunshots may also be irreparable. The military has stopped him from receiving treatment outside one of its own hospitals, and is also charging him with incitement, which carries up to three years in jail.

His story echoes the brutality borne by other protesters of his generation. Among the first civilian casualties was a 19-year-old girl shot in the head by security forces. Then came an endless list of ruined futures – a 24-year-old father who lost his leg after being shot in Yangon on 10 March, in the north-west region of Sagaing, a 20-year-old man whose leg was also amputated after the military reportedly threw a hand grenade, a 19-year-old student shot dead near Yangon on 27 March, and even younger casualties on the same day, such as a 14-year-old girl who died in her home after security forces sprayed bullets in a neighbourhood, and a seven-year-old girl shot while sitting on her father’s lap in Mandalay.

Some of those who survived the attacks have been maimed for life or are unable to work as a result of their injuries.

‘I wanted a happy life’

“I wrote content, worked hard and spent a lot of time with friends,” says Wai, 21, an online culture writer. “My future was clear: I wanted a good job, a happy family and a peaceful life.”

But since the military seized power, Wai’s main goal has been to avoid the junta’s forces, who have killed and maimed hundreds of his peers. Now unemployed because of the economic crisis triggered in the coup’s aftermath, he fears junta troops will hunt him down.

A 2014 consensus showed that more than 50% of Myanmar’s population was under the age of 30. This segment has direct knowledge of the military’s disastrous rule that over decades impoverished a once-prosperous nation, but also a decade of exposure to the outside world as well as better access to information, education and job opportunities. Faced once more with a military dictatorship, their role in the anti-coup movement is testament to the sacrifices they are willing to make for hard-earned rights.

“If the junta beats this revolution, our future is gone,” says Wai, who saw a fellow protester shot dead in North Okkalapa, a township in Myanmar’s biggest city Yangon, on 8 March – a week before martial law was declared in the area.

“If they win, I won’t marry or have children because I wouldn’t want my family to live under their control. International relations would be ruined, and life would become like North Korea. We’ll protest as much as we can until we win. It is worth giving your life for the next generation.”

The regime’s forces have killed at least 714 people since the coup, according to the Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), but hundreds more are likely to have been seriously wounded by live rounds, mortar fire, hand grenades and other weapons used by the military.

It is worth giving your life for the next generation Wai

The country risks spiralling into “full-blown conflict,” according to UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, who on Tuesday urged countries to push the military into halting its violent repression against citizens.

Following the latest massacre of at least 82 civilians in Bago, she said the world “must not allow the deadly mistakes of the past in Syria and elsewhere to be repeated.”

Atrocities have become increasingly difficult to record because of the regime’s shutdown of mobile data and wireless broadband that has blocked internet access for most of the population. Meanwhile, analysts have warned of a dramatic reversal in the economic progress Myanmar gained over the past decade. The World Bank has projected the economy to shrink 10% in 2021, but Fitch Solutions has forecast a 20% decline in growth for the 2020-21 fiscal year and impending “economic collapse”.

While some protesters have begun to use makeshift weapons against security forces, hundreds of others are reportedly travelling to territory controlled by ethnic armed groups where they are receiving training in basic warfare. Clashes are intensifying between the ethnic groups and the Tatmadaw, which has deployed deadly airstrikes near Myanmar’s borders with China and Thailand. Recent reports indicate that the military has also sentenced to death 23 people following secret trials, including four protesters.

Ruined futures

Another victim of military brutality was Thet Paing Soe, 30, who was supporting his mother with his salary as a driver.

On 20 March, Thet Paing Soe was shot while hiding from security forces down an alley in Yangon’s Tamwe township. His family rushed the funeral because they feared soldiers would seize the body.

The second youngest of six siblings and not yet married, his loss “could not be put into words,” said the brother. “I am still suffering,” he says. “If it were possible, I would fight back, but [without weapons] we are still unable to do that.”

After glimpsing life under a government chosen by the people, Min Thura, 23, felt he had no choice but to demonstrate against a return to military rule.

Before the coup, he applied for a warehouse job in Yangon and on 4 March came the good news: his interview was successful. But it was too late by then. Security forces had shot him in the left eye with a rubber bullet the previous day, causing damage to his right eye as well. Forced to decline the role and go into the care of his family, he said his doctor doubts he will recover his eyesight.

“I have to accept that I will no longer be able to see,” he says.

As plans come together for a federal army to face the Tatmadaw, Min Thura said young people should join the resistance.

“I don’t want our citizens to get hurt or die any more because we’re all brothers and sisters,” he said, adding that if the international community is planning to help: “please help us as quickly as possible.”",1262,7406,15,109
0,Nasa picks Elon Musk’s SpaceX to build spacecraft to return humans to moon | SpaceX,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/apr/17/nasa-spacex-moon-spacecraft-elon-musk,"Nasa has chosen SpaceX to build the next-generation spacecraft that will return humans to the moon, further strengthening Elon Musk’s grip on the burgeoning public-private space industry.

The $2.9bn contract to build the lunar lander that will spearhead the Artemis program, Nasa’s ambitious project to return to the moon for the first time since the final Apollo mission in 1972, was announced on Friday.

“The Artemis lunar landing is a key piece to our moon-to-Mars strategy,” Steve Jurczyk, acting Nasa administrator, told reporters. “Today is a big step forward. This is an incredible time to be involved in human exploration for all humanity.”

Musk’s company is currently the only operation with the capability of launching astronauts from US soil. But Nasa’s decision to go with a sole contractor for its human landing system (HLS) raised eyebrows.

Traditionally, the agency has preferred to stimulate competition and protect against setbacks by keeping at least two contractors on the payroll.

This time, partly for budgetary reasons, Nasa chose to reject proposals by the Amazon tycoon Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin, a partnership with Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper; and the defense contractor Dynetics.

All three bids were chosen for the preliminary stages of the HLS project in 2020.

“Congrats to SpaceX, but [I’m] honestly shocked Nasa is going with a single provider here,” Casey Dreier, senior space policy adviser, said in a tweet. “Of course, SpaceX always acts as if it’s a constant competition with itself. And it’s 100% delivered on its capability and price promise so far.”

Dreier calculated that “if SpaceX pulls this off, the US will get a human-capable lunar landing system for 13% the price of Apollo era hardware”.

The Artemis program also includes the Space Launch System, the most powerful rocket ever built, and the Orion spacecraft that will ferry crews. The SpaceX bid features its Starship landing system, currently under development.

Nasa has said the Artemis program will land the first woman and the first person of color on the moon. The Trump administration directed the agency to achieve the goal by 2024 but the timeline slipped because of budget cuts.

Joe Biden’s request to Congress, announced earlier this month, seeks $24.7bn for Nasa, an increase of 6.3% on the previous year, including $6.9bn for Artemis.

After the retirement of the space shuttle fleet in 2011, the US was unable to launch humans into space for nine years. Now, SpaceX continues to press ahead with its human spaceflight program. Since May 2020 it has sent two crews to the International Space Station. A third mission, Crew 2, is set for launch on 22 April.",455,2810,15,83
1,Woman Heartbroken For All Shelter Pets Who Will Be Put Down Without Ever Being Dressed Like A Ghostbuster,https://www.theonion.com/woman-heartbroken-for-all-shelter-pets-who-will-be-put-1845426857,"CHICAGO—As she gazed into each kennel and let out a deep, regretful sigh, 31-year-old Chicago resident Lisa Kessler told reporters Thursday it broke her heart to think of all the pets in her local shelter who would be put down without ever being dressed like a Ghostbuster. “It’s just so sad that the majority of the dogs in here will be put to sleep, never getting the chance to wear a little tan jumpsuit, a doggy-sized proton pack, or a bushy Harold Ramis wig,” said Kessler, adding that if she had the time and money, she would adopt every animal in the facility, put them in adorable costumes representing all major characters from the 1984 comedy classic and parade them before her friends on Instagram. “That’s something every pet deserves to do once. Even though I’m leaving today with a new dog, it pains me to know so many of those who remain will have their lives cut short before ever getting posed next to a person who is also dressed like a Ghostbuster, or next to a cat dressed like Slimer. Unfortunately, thousands of senior dogs, pit bulls, and Chihuahuas get put down too soon, despite the fact that most of them can still really clean up on Halloween.” Kessler went on to acknowledge that some pets may simply whine and chew at their costumes after they are dressed up, at which point it may indeed be time to take them to a vet and have them euthanized.",249,1373,18,105
0,Third of French wine lost after rare cold snaps devastate vines,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/apr/15/agricultural-disaster-two-billion-worth-of-french-wine-production-lost-after-cold-snaps?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other,"At least a third of French wine production worth almost €2bn (£1.7bn) in sales will be lost this year after rare freezing temperatures devastated many vines and fruit crops across France, raising concerns over the climate crisis.

“This is probably the greatest agricultural catastrophe of the beginning of the 21st century,” the French agriculture minister, Julien Denormandie, said this week as the government declared an “agricultural disaster” and began preparing emergency financial measures.

The unseasonal wave of bitter frost and ice hit suddenly after a bout of warm weather, which worsened the damage. The warmth had encouraged vines and fruit trees to develop earlier than usual, only to be withered by the sudden cold.

The national federation of agricultural holders’ unions told AFP it believes at least a third of French wine production would be lost as certain grape harvests in many of France’s best-known wine-producing regions risked being decimated.

The destruction has hit a swathe of France, including Bordeaux, Burgundy, the Rhône Valley and Provence, damaging vines but also hitting growers of kiwis, apricots, apples and other fruit as well as crops such as beet and rapeseed.

Wine-makers had battled over several nights to try to save vineyards, attempting to heat up fields by lighting thousands of small fires and candles near vines and trees. This created the extraordinary spectacle of the night sky lit by rows of flames between vines.

President Emmanuel Macron tweeted a picture of vineyards lit by candles, expressing support for farmers whom he said were fighting “night after night” to protect crops.

À vous, agriculteurs qui, partout en France, avez lutté sans relâche, nuit après nuit, pour protéger les fruits de votre travail, je veux vous dire notre soutien plein et entier dans ce combat. Tenez bon ! Nous sommes à vos côtés et le resterons. pic.twitter.com/uaW9TmPxYh — Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) April 10, 2021

Michel-Henri Ratte had set alarms through several nights to light candles to protect his 9 hectares (22 acres) of biodynamic vineyards around Arbois in the Jura, eastern France. But severe frost, followed by snow, devastated the early shoots on the vines.

“We’d bought huge candles – like big paint pots of full of wax –– and we placed them between the vines and ran out to light them at 2am,” he said.

“There were still some green shoots but then the snow came. It was catastrophic. Currently, we’re looking at 100% loss on this year’s harvest. We’ll know in a month if anything has survived. We live close to nature, we’re used to dealing with changing weather, but we were damaged by cold snaps in 2017 and 2019. For it to be happening every two years, and for weather to be going swiftly from very hot to very cold, raises questions about climate change. It wasn’t normal cold, it was a polar cold, much more intense than usual.”

Ratte usually produces up to 30,000 bottles a year but might not produce a single one this year.

He said: “Covid-19 and the lockdown had already left us feeling as if time had stopped and we were in another world. We miss the social interaction, [and] customers coming to our home. During that time, the vines kept going, but now they’ve stopped too.”

Thomas Montagne, the head of the European confederation of independent winegrowers, and a producer in the Luberon, southern France, said: “There’s a sense of disillusionment because French wine producers had already been hit hard by Covid lockdowns and bar and restaurant closures. Independent producers were hit hard by the cancellation of wine fairs due to Covid. International exports have also been affected; we were already hit by the tariffs on French wine imposed by the former US president Donald Trump.”

He said winemakers felt “shock and sadness”.",644,3927,11,63

Go dd ammit, what a complete asshole!

As one of the many truly unique facets of the OGN g aming c onference, we were able to partner with EA Games to give each of our attendees a free pen bearing the video game developer’s logo completely free of charge. When Cliff Bleszinski first arrived he took three or four of them— a reasonable amount of pens that should satisfy the average person. But it’s apparently not enough for the greedy prick. We’re well aware that we didn’t have a sign that indicated only taking just one, but this is unbelievable.

We were under the impression that Bleszinski was excited to talk to an audience about his design philosophy with the Gears franchise and maybe sign a few copies , but when it came time for the panel we scheduled, he was peeling out from the parking lot cackling to himself with a van full of our precious EA Games pens.

Cliff Bleszinski, you unconscionable bastard!

What’s disappointing is this was one of the main points of promotion for this conference. We paid an ungodly amount for targeted ads to gamers that read “ Come to the OGE and receive a free white EA Games click pen!” Now we’re left wondering if the only reason why Bleszinski agreed to the conference in the first place was so he could sneak behind our booth to steal boxes of pens while the security guard wasn’t looking.

Given that he took every pen we had, it’s hard to tell if this was simply an act of Machiavellian self-interest or some kind of declaration of war against our conference itself. You have to assume that he has the money to buy 10,000 pens if he wants. But why would someone need this many pens? Maybe he intends to offload them to a fence who can sell them on the black market.

Regardless of the reason, this is a huge dick move.

Christ, sorry you had to find out like this, gamers. But Cliff Bleszinski is the true scum of the Earth for taking off with all 10,000 of our EA Games pens, and we also sincerely apologize that nobody else will get the opportunity to have a free pen. We know it comes as a huge disappointment, but you’ll have to make do with the free EA Games bouncy balls and coasters while we all wish that Cliffy B would go straight to hell.",463,2526,16,96

The court sided with the federal government Thursday in overturning a lower court decision that had called into question the future of the Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA), amid arguments that the United States cannot be considered a safe country for asylum seekers.

The decision will have devastating effects on would-be refugee claimants, their advocates say.

“The real consequences of this decision rest with those refugee claimants who are being returned to U.S. detention facilities after being turned back and facing harm both in jail and in the U.S. asylum process,” said Amanda Aziz of the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers.

“What is lost in this decision are the people who will continue to face real and severe harm because of the ongoing operation of the STCA.”

Under the bilateral pact, Canada and the U.S. each recognize the other country as a safe place to seek protection.

That means Canada can turn back potential refugees who arrive at land ports of entry along the Canada-U. S. border on the basis they should pursue their claims in the States, the country where they first arrived.

The agreement, which took effect in 2004, was originally touted by officials in both countries as a way to curb “asylum shopping.” However, critics have long argued that the U.S. asylum system is cruel and inhumane — critiques that grew louder during the Trump administration.

In July, the Federal Court found it unconstitutional to ban would-be claimants from attempting to enter either country at official border crossings, saying the impacts of the policy “shock the conscience.”

Justice Ann Marie McDonald had given Ottawa six months to respond and fix the policy to make sure it complies with the Canadian charter before declaring the accord invalid. That deadline was later extended at the request of the government while the appeal was being heard.

However, in its decision released Thursday, Canada’s appeal court said lawyers for asylum seekers and their supporters focused on the wrong issues in challenging the law’s constitutionality.

It said there are proper checks and balances in the legislative scheme to ensure Canadian laws and the charter are upheld, and it’s within the government’s authority to make regulations designating a country as safe for refugees.

Instead of using individual refugees’ experiences to show the bilateral pact itself violated their Charter rights, said the appeal court, lawyers for the litigants should have made a case of how existing administrative oversight has failed to safeguard their rights.

“The legislative scheme as a whole, assuming it is operated properly, is designed to protect fundamental human rights, including charter rights,” wrote Justice David Stratas in a unanimous decision on behalf of the three-member panel.

“Based on the record before us, to the extent that detrimental effects are being suffered by persons being returned to the United States, the legislative scheme as a whole is not to blame.”

The federal government welcomed the decision.

“Canada remains firmly committed to upholding a fair and compassionate refugee protection system and the STCA remains a comprehensive means for the compassionate, fair, and orderly handling of asylum claims at the Canada-U.S. land border,” said Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino and Public Safety Minister Bill Blair in a joint statement.

In its ruling, the appeal court said Parliament created a mechanism to monitor the designated country’s compliance on an ongoing basis.

Although the law doesn’t specify what continuing review means, who should conduct it and what should be examined in a review, a policy was developed for the assessment based on a wide variety of governmental and non-governmental sources.

The court said immigration officers also have a number of powers and discretions to make exemptions to accept claims by individuals who would otherwise be ineligible to cross into Canada and seek asylum under the Safe Third Country Agreement.

As well, refugee claimants have access to the Federal Court if they believe the circumstances of their removal warrant the court’s intervention.

“In this case, there was no evidence that could support a finding that the treatment of returnees to the United States at the Canada-United States border ‘shocks the conscience,’” said the appeal court.

“There is evidence of individual cases of substandard treatment but nothing that rises to the very high level required by the ‘shocks the conscience’ standard.”

In 2007, three advocacy groups — the Canadian Council for Refugees, Amnesty International and the Canadian Council of Churches — took Ottawa to federal court and successfully had the U.S. declared unsafe for refugees.

However, the decision was later overturned on appeal, largely on the grounds that the groups failed to find a lead individual litigant who was directly impacted by the policy.

In 2017, those groups returned to the court with a group of asylum seekers whose access to Canadian asylum was denied under the Safe Third Country Agreement to support their arguments.

This appeal court said some of the evidence, although voluminous, is piecemeal and individualized and, thus, is problematic for drawing system-wide inferences concerning the situation in the U.S.

“The value of evidence is not measured by the pound,” Justice Stratas wrote. “The evidence of the particular treatment of ten individuals — all selected by the claimants — cannot itself provide a basis for making system-wide inferences.”

Citing a previous court case that found psychological suffering inherent in the plight of refugees fleeing persecution, Stratas wrote: “One must ask whether sending refugee claimants back to the United States actually increased psychological suffering above this inherent level.”

Janet Dench of the Canadian Council for Refugees said the court’s findings were disappointing.

OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — A Canadian Parliament member was caught stark naked in a virtual meeting of the House of Commons.

William Amos, who has represented the Quebec district of Pontiac since 2015, appeared on the screens of his fellow lawmakers completely naked Wednesday. The pandemic has meant many Canadian lawmakers participate in sessions via video conference instead of in person.

A screenshot obtained by The Canadian Press shows Amos standing behind a desk between the Quebec and Canadian flags, his private parts hidden by what appears to be a mobile phone in one hand.

“This was an unfortunate error,″ Amos said in a statement sent by email. ”`My video was accidentally turned on as I was changing into my work clothes after going for a jog. I sincerely apologize to my colleagues in the House of Commons for this unintentional distraction. Obviously, it was an honest mistake and it won’t happen again.”

Claude DeBellefeuille, a legislator for the opposition Bloc Quebecois party, raised the incident in a point of order after question period, suggesting that parliamentary decorum requires male Parliament members to wear a jacket and tie — and a shirt, underwear and trousers.

Speaker Anthony Rota later thanked DeBellefeuille for her “observations” and clarified that while he had not seen anything, he checked with technicians and confirmed they saw something. He reminded lawmakers to always be vigilant when they are near a camera and microphone.

Amos, the parliamentary secretary to Industry Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne, was visible only to Parliament members and staffers on an internal video conference feed. Because he was not speaking, his image did not show up on the public feed.

Liberal Party colleague Mark Holland said Amos was “utterly mortified.” Holland said he was satisfied with the explanation from his colleague.

“I don’t think there was any ill intent. It’s certainly an unfortunate circumstance,″ Holland said.

“This is a warning to everybody,” Holland added. “You’ve got to really always assume that camera is on and be very careful any time you wander anywhere near that camera that you’re dressed appropriately.″

Asked if he will be issuing a warning to all Liberal lawmakers to that effect, Holland said: ``Oh, big time.″",524,3248,7,54

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday urged the governments of Western countries to penalise those deliberately spreading their message of hate against Muslims by disrespecting Prophet Muhammad in the same way that they had outlawed any negative comment against the Holocaust.

Speaking after a week of violent protests in Pakistan by a radical party outraged by French government support for magazines publishing cartoons of the Prophet, Khan said in a series of tweets that insulting the Prophet hurt Muslims around the world. “We can’t tolerate any disrespect & abuse,” he said. “I also call on Western governments who have outlawed any negative comment on the Holocaust to use the same standards to penalise those deliberately spreading their message of hate against Muslims by abusing our Prophet.”

The group Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan was banned on Thursday by the Pakistan government. Several European countries and Israel have laws against Holocaust denial.

1,Why Do All These Homosexuals Keep Sucking My Cock?,https://www.theonion.com/why-do-all-these-homosexuals-keep-sucking-my-cock-1819584210,"Bruce Heffernan



Look, I'm not a hateful person or anything—I believe we should all live and let live. But lately, I've been having a real problem with these homosexuals. You see, just about wherever I go these days, one of them approaches me and starts sucking my cock.

Advertisement

Take last Sunday, for instance, when I casually struck up a conversation with this guy in the health-club locker room. Nothing fruity, just a couple of fellas talking about their workout routines while enjoying a nice hot shower. The guy looked like a real man's man, too—big biceps, meaty thighs, thick neck. He didn't seem the least bit gay. At least not until he started sucking my cock, that is.

Where does this queer get the nerve to suck my cock? Did I look gay to him? Was I wearing a pink feather boa without realizing it? I don't recall the phrase, ""Suck my cock"" entering the conversation, and I don't have a sign around my neck that reads, ""Please, You Homosexuals, Suck My Cock.""

I've got nothing against homosexuals. Let them be free to do their gay thing in peace, I say. But when they start sucking my cock, I've got a real problem.

Then there was the time I was hiking through the woods and came across a rugged-looking, blond-haired man in his early 30s. He seemed straight enough to me while we were bathing in that mountain stream, but, before you know it, he's sucking my cock!

What is it with these homos? Can't they control their sexual urges? Aren't there enough gay cocks out there for them to suck on without them having to target normal people like me?

Believe me, I have no interest in getting my cock sucked by some queer. But try telling that to the guy at the beach club. Or the one at the video store. Or the one who catered my wedding. Or any of the countless other homos who've come on to me recently. All of them sucked my cock, and there was nothing I could do to stop them.

I tell you, when a homosexual is sucking your cock, a lot of strange thoughts go through your head: How the hell did this happen? Where did this fairy ever get the idea that I was gay? And where did he get those fantastic boots?

It screws with your head at other times, too. Every time a man passes me on the street, I'm afraid he's going to grab me and drag me off to some bathroom to suck my cock. I've even started to visualize these repulsive cock-sucking episodes during the healthy, heterosexual marital relations I enjoy with my wife—even some that haven't actually happened, like the sweaty, post-game locker-room tryst with Vancouver Canucks forward Mark Messier that I can't seem to stop thinking about.

Things could be worse, I suppose. It could be women trying to suck my cock, which would be adultery and would make me feel tremendously guilty. As it is, I'm just angry and sickened. But, believe me, that's enough. I don't know what makes these homosexuals mistake me for a guy who wants his cock sucked, and, frankly, I don't want to know. I just wish there were some way to get them to stop.

I've tried all sorts of things, but it's all been to no avail. A few months back, I started wearing an intimidating-looking black leather thong with menacing metal studs in the hopes that it would frighten those faggots off, but it didn't work. In fact, it only seemed to encourage them. Then, I really started getting rough, slapping them around whenever they were sucking my cock, but that failed, too. Even pulling out of their mouths just before ejaculation and shooting sperm all over their face, chest, and hair seemed to have no effect. What do I have to do to get the message across to these swishes?

I swear, if these homosexuals don't take a hint and quit sucking my cock all the time, I'm going to have to resort to drastic measures—like maybe pinning them down to the cement floor of the loading dock with my powerful forearms and working my cock all the way up their butt so they understand loud and clear just how much I disapprove of their unwelcome advances. I mean, you can't get much more direct than that.",740,4101,9,50

0,China’s Very Bad Bank: Inside the Huarong Debt Debacle,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-very-bad-bank-inside-032159830.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGrgvp9lZ9oCkaqjMqe010IU1ybyeNmA_0gGYIuDUQW8UsGgo2nJ_6bR7Jlf1WvMuaVilHEpqwXGF77plLQa6K3PYb5p_F08LsXRp3DnU_jkNRjzAFuDcbPrB_WVkoQCslz8AnysEd630iISjCtc8VluLDnVTOmsZXVa2B74Xxkj,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s been 11 weeks since Lai Xiaomin, the man once known as the God of Wealth, was executed on a cold Friday morning in the Chinese city of Tianjin.

But his shadow still hangs over one of the most dramatic corruption stories ever to come out of China – a tale that has now set nerves on edge around the financial world.

At its center is China Huarong Asset Management Co., the state financial company that Lai lorded over until getting ensnared in a sweeping crackdown on corruption by China’s leader, Xi Jinping.

From Hong Kong to London to New York, questions burn. Will the Chinese government stand behind $23.2 billion that Lai borrowed on overseas markets -- or will international bond investors have to swallow losses? Are key state-owned enterprises like Huarong still too big to fail, as global finance has long assumed – or will these companies be allowed to stumble, just like anyone else?

The answers will have huge implications for China and markets across Asia. Should Huarong fail to pay back its debts in full, the development would cast doubt over a core tenet of Chinese investment: the assumed government backing for important state-owned enterprises, or SOEs.

“A default at a central state-owned company like Huarong is unprecedented,” said Owen Gallimore, head of credit strategy at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group. Should one occur, he said, it would mark “a watershed moment” for Chinese and Asian credit markets.

Not since the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s has the issue weighed so heavily. Huarong bonds -- among the most widely held SOE debt worldwide -- recently fell to a record low of about 52 cents on the dollar. That’s not the pennies on a dollar normally associated with deeply troubled companies elsewhere, but it’s practically unheard of for an SOE.

Fears of a near-term default eased on Thursday after the company was said to have prepared funds for full repayment of a S$600 million ($450 million) offshore bond due April 27. Huarong plans to pay on the due date, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named discussing private information.

Story continues

That’s a drop in the ocean and won’t remove investor concerns. All told, Huarong owes bondholders at home and abroad the equivalent of $42 billion. Some $17.1 billion of that falls due by the end of 2022, according to Bloomberg-compiled data.

Bad Bank

It wasn’t supposed to be this way. Huarong was created in the aftermath of the ‘90s Asian collapse to avert another crisis, not cause one. The idea was to contain a swelling wave of bad loans threatening Chinese banks. Huarong was to serve as a “bad bank,” a safe repository for the billions in souring loans made to state companies.

Along with three other bad banks, Huarong swapped delinquent debts for stakes in hundreds of big SOEs and, in the process, helped turn around chronic money-losers like the giant China Petroleum & Chemical Corp.

After Lai took over in 2012, Huarong reached for more, pushing into investment banking, trusts, real estate and positioning itself as a key player in China’s $54 trillion financial industry.

Before long, global banks came knocking. In 2013, for instance, Shane Zhang, co-head of Asia-Pacific investment banking at Morgan Stanley, met with Lai. Zhang said his company was “very optimistic” about the future of Huarong, according to a statement posted on Huarong’s website at the time.

Before Huarong went public in Hong Kong in 2015, it sold a $2.4 billion stake to a group of investors including Warburg Pincus, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and Malaysia’s sovereign wealth fund. BlackRock Inc. and Vanguard Group acquired lots of stock too, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock has collapsed 67% since its listing.

Lai had no trouble financing his grand ambitions. A big reason: Everyone thought Beijing would always stand behind a key company like Huarong. It easily borrowed money in the offshore market at rates as low as 2.1%. It borrowed still more in the domestic interbank market. Along the way Lai transformed Huarong into a powerful shadow lender, extending credit to companies that banks turned away.

The truth was darker. Lai, a former senior official at the nation’s banking regulator, doled out loans with little oversight from his board or risk management committee.

One Huarong credit officer said Lai personally called the shots on most of the offshore corporate loans underwritten by her division.

Money also flowed to projects disguised as parts of China’s push to build railroads, ports and more around the world – the so-called Belt and Road Initiative, according to an executive at a state bank. Huarong didn’t immediately reply to questions on its lending practices.

Given Lai’s fate, both people spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Huarong snapped up more than half of the 510 billion yuan in distressed debts disposed of by Chinese banks in 2016. At its peak, Lai’s sprawling empire had almost 200 units at home and abroad. He boasted in 2017 that Huarong, having reached the Hong Kong stock exchange, would soon go public in mainland China, too.

The IPO never happened. Lai was arrested in 2018 and subsequently confessed to a range of economic crimes in a state TV show. He spoke of trunk-loads of cash being spirited into a Beijing apartment he’d dubbed “the supermarket.” Authorities said they discovered 200 million yuan there. Expensive real estate, luxury watches, art, gold – the list of Lai’s treasure ran on.

This past January, Lai was found guilty by the Secondary Intermediate People’s Court in Tianjin of accepting of $277 million in bribes between 2008 and 2018. He was put to death three weeks later – a rare use of capital punishment for economic crimes. Some took the execution as a message from China’s leader, Xi Jinping: my crackdown on corruption will roll on.

At Huarong, the bottom has fallen out. Net income plummeted 95% from 2017 to 2019, to 1.4 billion yuan, and then sank 92% during the first half of 2020. Assets have shriveled by 165 billion yuan.

The company on April 1 announced that it would delay its 2020 results, saying its auditor needed more time. The influential Caixin magazine this week openly speculated about Huarong’s fate, including the possibility of bankruptcy. Its credit outlook was put on review for a potential downgrade by all three top rating firms.

According to people familiar with the matter, Huarong has proposed a sweeping restructuring. The plan would involve offloading its money-losing, non-core businesses. Huarong is still trying to get a handle on what those businesses might be worth. The proposal, which the government would have to approve, helps explain why the company delayed its 2020 results, the people said.

Company executives have been meeting with peers at state banks to assuage their concerns over the past two weeks, a Huarong official said.

The Chinese finance ministry has raised another possibility: transferring its stake in Huarong to a unit of the nation’s sovereign wealth fund that could then sort out the assorted debt problems. Regulators have held several meetings to discuss the company’s plight, according to people familiar with the matter.

In an emailed response to questions from Bloomberg, Huarong said it has “adequate liquidity” and plans to announce the expected date of its 2020 earnings release after consulting with auditors. China’s banking and insurance regulator didn’t immediately respond to a request seeking comment on Huarong’s situation.

News the company aims to repay a note due this month helped its bonds rebound from record lows on Thursday. It’s not just about cost of funding though, said Thu Ha Chow, a portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles Investments Asia in Singapore. For Huarong to access the market it will need “a clear and definitive commitment,” from China’s finance ministry toward the offshore debt or clarity on a restructuring, she said.

One thing is sure: Huarong is part of a much bigger problem in China. State-owned enterprises are shouldering the equivalent of $4.1 trillion in debt, and a growing number of them are struggling to keep current with creditors. In all, SOEs reneged on a record 79.5 billion yuan of local bonds in 2020, lifting their share of onshore payment failures to 57% from just 8.5% a year earlier, according to Fitch Ratings. The figure jumped to 72% in the first quarter of 2021.

The shockwaves from Huarong and these broader debt problems have only begun to reverberate through Chinese finance. Dismantling all or part of Lai’s old empire would show Beijing is willing to accept short-term pain to instill financial discipline among state-owned enterprises.

The irony is that Huarong was supposed to fix China’s big debt problem, not cause a new one.

“Allowing a state-owned financial institution that undertook the task of resolving troubles of China’s financial system to fail is the worst way to handle risks,” said Feng Jianlin, a Beijing-based chief analyst at research institute FOST. “The authorities must consider the massive risk spillover effects.”

Varadkar has previously admitted that in April 2019, while he was Taoiseach, he sent a copy of a doctors’ pay deal between the State and the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) to his friend, Dr Maitiu O Tuathail.

Dr O Tuathail was head of the rival organisation, the National Association of General Practitioners (NAGP), at the time.

A Garda inquiry into the matter was updated to a criminal investigation in recent weeks

It is also understood that O Tuathail was interviewed by gardai.

Varadkar has apologised for leaking the document, but has denied breaking any laws.

And speaking last month, he said he does not believe he will face criminal charges.

Varadkar was asked, hypothetically, if a member of government should step aside temporarily if criminal charges are brought against them.

He replied: “I’m not contemplating that.

“I’ve been trying to avoid creating new stories about this issue.

“So, you know that’s not something I’m considering.

Well, gamers, you can rest easy, because Bethesda has announced that while LaBeouf will be in the upcoming game, his character dies almost as soon as he appears.

That’s right, gaming fans! You can breathe a sigh of relief and let your excitement for the upcoming Bethesda offering bubble over now that developers have confirmed that The Crystal Skull’s well-known sidekick will appear early in the game riding a motorcycle and wearing his characteristic leather jacket, utter a couple of lines of dialogue, and then immediately lose control of his bike and crash headfirst into a tree!

“We wanted to give fans the full Indiana Jones experience, including appearances from all the major characters from the franchise, and we hope players will really enjoy witnessing Mutt appear by Indy’s side for a few moments before he gets launched down a craggy canyon hillside and tumbled into a field of cottonmouth snakes,” developer Todd Howard told OGN, confirming that the cutscene would lead to gameplay that let players stand over LaBeouf’s body as he bled out.



“I don’t want to reveal too much, but I can tell you we’re also planning on having Mutt appear in a few flashbacks where he’s drowning in quicksand and no one is there to save him, and we just know longtime aficionados of the series will love the scene where crows and insects feast on Mutt’s decaying corpse,” he added. “Admittedly, it’s a little bit of fan service, but it’s hard to resist when you have such an iconically loathsome character that people just want to see die.”

Wow. And if that’s not exciting enough, Howard went on to drop a few more hints, announcing that the game would reveal that the monkey who was poisoned by figs in Raiders actually survived and would save Indy’s life dozens of times.",348,2083,19,125
0,Most Americans want to end lifetime Supreme Court appointments,https://www.reuters.com/business/legal/most-americans-want-end-lifetime-supreme-court-appointments-2021-04-18/,"A view of the Supreme Court in Washington, U.S. January 19, 2021. Susan Walsh/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo

A majority of Americans want to end lifetime appointments for U.S. Supreme Court justices, according to an Ipsos poll for Reuters, though less than half are in favor of other efforts to reform the judiciary.

The national opinion poll, conducted on Thursday and Friday, found that 63% of adults supported term or age limits for Supreme Court justices. Another 22% said they opposed any limits and the rest did not express an opinion.

The poll also found that only 38% would support expanding the size of the court by adding four more justices. Another 42% said they would oppose doing so and the rest were unsure.

Liberal activists and some legal scholars have been pushing for judicial reforms as Republican leaders in Congress built a 6-to-3 conservative Supreme Court majority over the past several years, in part by blocking a Democratic nominee and allowing Republican former President Donald Trump to install three picks during his single term.

Some Democratic lawmakers on Thursday introduced legislation to expand the Supreme Court to 13 justices, a move that they believe would restore public confidence in the judicial branch. But the party's leadership appeared cool to the idea of pursuing that course.

President Joe Biden has formed a bi-partisan committee to look at the merits of adding justices as well as other potential reforms to the court.

While Congress has the power to change the number of justices who sit on the court, legal scholars believe it would likely require a constitutional amendment to end their lifetime appointments.

The poll found that only 49% of Americans have a ""great deal"" or a ""fair amount"" of confidence in decisions made by Supreme Court justices. In comparison, 43% of respondents expressed a similar amount of trust in decisions made by the White House and 32% said the same of decisions made by Congress.

The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. The survey gathered responses from 1,003 adults. The results have a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 4 percentage points.

0,Reminder: Never ask the cops in Japan to shoot you,https://soranews24.com/2021/04/16/reminder-never-ask-the-cops-in-japan-to-shoot-you/,"Man in Nagoya learns obvious lesson the hard way.

For most people, Sunday night is a quiet night, as the weekend winds down and they get back into the mental mode necessary for the coming week of work or school. However, last Sunday at around 10 p.m., a 47-year-old man in Nagoya’s Kaminagoya neighborhood was spotted trying to light a fire inside a parking structure.

A passerby noticed flames of some sort and called the police, who dispatched an officer who quickly arrived on scene, finding the suspect on the first floor of the building brandishing a knife. When he realized he’d been spotted, the suspect snarled “Shoot me if you can!” and retreated up to the higher floors.

The officer gave chase, and when they reached the third floor the suspect stopped running, and instead began advancing on the officer. The officer warned him to throw down his weapon, announcing “If you don’t drop the knife, I will shoot you.” Undeterred, the suspect continued advancing. When a warning shot fired at the suspect’s feet still didn’t stop him, the officer obliged the suspect’s request, and made good on his promise, by putting a bullet in the man’s lower abdomen.

▼ The building where the incident took place

Following the shooting, the man was arrested on the spot, although instead of being taken to jail he was transported to the hospital for medical treatment. He was conscious during the ambulance ride, and his life is in no danger.

The incident is similar to one that took place in Osaka a few years ago, when a man advancing on officers while holding a knife told them “If you’re going to shoot me, then do it already” and got a slug in the thigh for his tough talk. So remember, while Japanese police training includes something called taiho-jutsu, or “arresting martial arts techniques,” designed to subdue criminals in a low-impact, low-injury way, the cops will skip the grappling when dealing with someone with a dangerous weapon, especially someone who’s literally asking to get shot.

0,Nigeria's Minister of Communications revealed to have pro Al-Qaeda views and links to Salafi terrorism,http://saharareporters.com/2021/04/15/unmasking-jihadi-masquerade-many-faces-isa-ali-ibrahim-pantami,"Nigerian Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Ali Isa Ibrahim Pantami is a man of many descriptions. To some, he is a bright-eyed, relentlessly intelligent and academically competent Young Turk, who has found his way into the topmost level of Nigeria's government at the relatively young age of 48.

To others, he is a symbol of how deeply held and unapologetically public religious faith can coexist and interoperates with modernity and cosmopolitanism without contradiction.

Isa Pantami

His Twitter handle proudly displays his impressive academic credentials side-by-side with his proud elementary educational background at an Islamic Tsangaya (non-Hausa readers might be more familiar with the term 'Almajiri').

Despite his impressive credentials and his reportedly genial personality which have endeared him to many however, several whispers and rumours about an allegedly dark past have continuously swirled around him at every point in his 5 year-old career as a public servant. From his 2016 appointment as DG/CEO at the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), through to his appointment as a cabinet minister in 2019, these rumours have refused to go away.

Today for the first time ever, we can authoritatively lift the veil on Dr. Ali Isa Ibrahim Pantami and establish his strong and indisputable connections to - and deeply held sympathies for - the dark world of Salafist Islamic terrorism. It is a story that starts in Pantami Ward in Gombe State; meanders through extreme controversy at Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University in Bauchi State; takes a notable detour through a Saudi Arabian university known as a global hotbed for Salafist terror recruitment; and eventually ends with a known terror sympathiser and ideological 'gradualist' sitting in Nigeria's federal cabinet.

Pantami's Educational Controversies

Variously known as ""Dr Isa Pantami,"" ""Sheikh Ali Ibrahim,"" and ""Shaykh Isa Ali Pantami"" he has the unique distinction of being one of the very few people to achieve very high levels of academic achievement in both Western and Islamic education. Following a non-standard education path that included 4 years at a Tsangaya and 2 years of independent Islamic study after primary and secondary school, Pantami gained admission to the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University (ATBU) in the late 1990s where he studied Computer Science. He graduated with a BTech in 2003, followed by an Msc in 2008 and this is where the story gets interesting.

His official Twitter handle includes a bio link to his Wikipedia page, which is poorly referenced and light on detail. On further examination of the sources attributed on his Wikipedia page, it becomes evident that much of what is written there was in fact lifted word-for-word from an official government press release sent out to the media.

Isa Pantami's page on Wikipedia

Source article from PM News

Both straightforward accounts of his educational career make no mention of any controversy during his academic career. Keep this in mind for later. While digging into his academic qualifications, I was able to confirm that he did in fact obtain a PhD in 2014 from Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen. His impressive PhD thesis is linked here. It was impossible to verify his claims of attending Harvard, MIT, IMD Loussaune and Oxford university independently, although the nature of short certificate programs makes it necessary to extend the benefit of the doubt. We can assume these claims are all true.

The neat cover story starts to fall apart however, when a reference from a U.S. diplomatic cable leaked in 2009 by Wikileaks suggests that in his prior iteration as an academic at ATBU, Pantami was in fact a radical extremist cleric whose views were so repulsive that he was kicked out of the university and from a mosque in his native Gombe State.

It gets more interesting.

Where his personally-approved Wikipedia profile makes no mention of a stint in Saudi Arabia or what happened there, a bit of digging turns up information that significantly changes the clean-cut picture he is eager to present. According to multiple verifiable online and offline sources, Isa Pantami in fact spent a number of years learning and lecturing at the University of Medina in Saudi Arabia.

Isa Ali Pantami Profile on IslamicMarkets.com

This information is very important for two reasons. First, the Islamic University of Medina (IUM) is globally recognised as a hotspot for Salafist Islamic terror recruitment. While it does not itself teach or openly condone terror, it is the undisputed global headquarters of Salafist fundamentalism. The below excerpts from a UK Guardian article from 2001 illustrates how IUM serves as a recruitment pipeline that feeds extremist groups like the Taliban and Al-Qaeda.

The second reason that we should be very interested in Pantami's undisclosed sojourn within the world of Islamic education is that according to multiple sources, he studied the teachings of hardline Salafist scholars including Sheikh Muhammad Saleh Al-Uthaymeen. For those who do not know Sheikh Al-Uthaymeen, here is a collection of quotes and fatwas issued by the man described as a ""Giant of the Salafi movement.""

Source: Al Araby

Source: IBI Times

Source: UK Independent

Sheikh Al-Uthaymeen says that peace between Muslims and non-Muslims can only be temporary because ""jihad is the highest form of islam.""

A transcription of the video above goes as follows:

“If someone was to say; is a treaty permissible between us and the Mushrikeen (variously translated as disbelievers/idolaters/atheists), so that we don’t fight them and they don’t fight us? The answer is yes. If we need this, then it is allowed. For instance if the Muslims are in a state of weakness and they are not capable of fighting the enemy. So there is nothing wrong with carrying out a treaty between us and them. However, would the treaty have to be restricted to a limited time period or not?

We say the treaty is of three types: The first type is the restricted treaty meaning that we (the Muslims) say to the disbelievers, “Between us and you is ten years, or five years or eight years (of the treaty).”[…]The second type is the endless treaty which stipulates that we never attack. This is prohibited and I think it is by consensus because this necessitates abolishment of Jihad, and Jihad is the peak of Islam. There will be no power for a nation except by way of Jihad, if it is capable of this.”

For good measure, Sheikh Al-Uthaymeen also specified that his definition of 'Mushikreen' (disbelievers/people without God) also includes Christians and Jews.

Just a Series of Coincidences?

So far, we have established that Isa Pantami has a side to his past educational pursuits that most people are not aware of. However, it is tempting to dismiss these links to Salafist terror and extremism as merely circumstantial. Apart from what is essentially gossip from a Wikileaks cable, the documented views of the teachers he studied with, and the well-earned teror-recruitment-hotspot reputation of the Islamic University of Medina where he taught, there is no actual evidence so far to suggest that Isa Pantami himself is an extremist. Right?

He himself has tried to present himself as the unfortunate victim of such circumstances beyond his control. Commenting on a recent viral video that depicted him in debate with Boko Haram founder Mohammed Yusuf, he claimed that he was in fact a moderate Islamic scholar taking on the self-imposed and heroic task of de-radicalising Salafist extremists using his superior Islamic education and his ability to debate.

https://twitter.com/DrIsaPantami/status/1381584099010347012

He is apparently the victim of bigotry perpetrated by people who do not understand Hausa or context. How on earth could a STEM PhD holder with academic achievements spanning Harvard, MIT, Oxford and Cambridge be a lowkey Islamic extremist and terror apologist? What a ridiculous thought.

Or is it?

Cross Section of Isa Pantami's ""Suwaye Yan Taliban"" (""Who Are The Taliban?"") Public Lecture

In his prior iteration as Imam Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, our hero has been accused of making several incendiary utterances and expressing support for violent jihadists around the world. With the exception of a Wikileaks cable, there has been precious little to substantiate these claims. Until now.

For the first time, readers can listen to Imam Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami in his own words expressing deep support and admiration for Osama bin-Laden and the Afghan Taliban, even praying ""May God help us to imitate their good."" The following recording is from a public lecture Pantami delivered on September 12, 2006 in Bauchi State, titled ""Suwaye Yan Taliban"" (""Who Are The Taliban""). The recording is also freely available on the Nigerian Islamic community website DawahNigeria.com.

The following translation was made by Andrea Brigaglia PhD, Director of the Centre for Contemporary Islam at the University of Cape Town, South Africa. It can be found in her 2019 paper ""Debating Boko Haram.""

""

Osama Bin Laden is mentioned in various instances in this section, with his name always followed by the formula haẓahu ’Llāh (may God preserve him). At the same time, however, the government of Saudi Arabia is also the object of unreserved praises, being described as “our qibla” and “the original abode of faith.” The author mentions the Saudi and Pakistani involvement in the Afghani conflict as starting only after the end of the Afghani war, in a section titled “the post-Soviet era.” It was the leadership of the Arab mujāhidīn, Pantami continues, who invited Muslim countries such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan to be involved in the post-war peace agreement, and not Saudi Arabia and Pakistan who, in coordination with the United States, had funded the mujāhidīn for years.

References are made to a meeting held between all the leaders of the Afghani factions in Medina, with quotes from a book authored by the Saudi scholar Mūsā al-Qarnī, who is one of Pantami’s main sources (and who would later, in 2011, be handed a 20-year prison term by the Saudi government). Similarly, the anarchy that followed the end of the anti-Soviet war in Afghanistan is not attributed by Pantami to the contrasting agendas of the various political actors involved (the Afghani factions, the US, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the Arab foreign fighters), but to the “divide and rule” policy of the kuffār (unbelievers).

[Pantami then says that] it was in response to this anarchy that “the Commander of the Believers, Mullah Mohammad Omar, may God preserve him,” entered the scene. The formation of the Taliban, on 1st Muharram 1415, corresponding to 24 June 1994, is reconstructed through accurate historical detail fused with some hagiographic data: the 313 scholars who first established the Taliban, for example, correspond to the 313 companions who fought the Battle of Badr (624) alongside the Prophet. The ultimate goal of the Taliban was to bring peace and reconciliation in Afghanistan by “establishing an Islamic leadership, a Caliphate and the Sharia, as every Muslim is commanded to do.”

Here Pantami relies not only on the book by al-Qarnī but also on ‘The Rise of the Taliban’ and on a book by the Nigerian Salisu Shehu, ‘Who are the Talibans’. Pantami [says] that the Taliban are not immune from error. His particular concern is that “about 5% of them” have a penchant for Sufism, which obviously is, in his eyes, an imperfection in their credentials. The remaining 95%, however, are rooted in the “purest Sunni doctrine” (tataccen aƙidar Sunna): “they are people raised in the religious way, may God enable us to imitate their good” mutane masu tarbiya ta addini, Allah ya ba mu ikon koyi da alheransu). In particular, Pantami says that the Taliban are to be praised and imitated in three respects.

The first is the destruction of the two “idols of the Buddha” at Bamiyan. In imitating them, the Nigerian Muslims should long for the day in which every “idolatrous image” will be erased from the Nigerian currency, and no picture will be used on passports and electoral posters, for photos and images are contrary to the Sharia. The second is their effort to impose a strict adherence to the Sunna in the dress code of Afghani women (full face-veiling) and men (st-long beard and trousers cut at the length of the ankle). The third is the protection offered to Osama Bin Laden after the Americans rushed to accuse him of being responsible for the events of 9/11, by arguing that not only was there insufcient proof of his involvement, but also that “even if he had done it, according to the Sharia he should not be handed to you.”

The section concludes with a quote from Safar al-Hawali which is also a favourite scare-quote in the reservoir of contemporary islamophobes, according to which “hating America is part of our creed.” This is followed by prayers for the success of the Taliban; new comparisons between the Taliban and the Prophet’s Companions; and prayers for Bin Baz, al-Albani, Ibn al-‘Uthayimin and Azzam. Finally, there is an invitation to learn from the Taliban’s experience by studying hard “medicine and engineering” while patiently preparing for the moment when Nigeria will be ripe for a leader of the stature of Mullah Omar.

The first questioner asks how one should respond to those Salafis who reject Osama Bin Laden because of his killing of innocent unbelievers; this is probably a reference to the quietist and Saudi-loyalist strand of Salafi thought in Nigeria, represented by scholars such as Muhammad Sani Umar Rijiyar Lemo.

Pantami responded to the questioner by saying that yes, these scholars have some truth, for Bin Laden is liable to make mistakes, but “I still consider him as a better Muslim than myself.” “We are all happy whenever unbelievers are being killed,” continued Pantami, “but the Sharia does not allow us to kill them without a reason.” “Our zeal (hamasa) should not take precedence over our obedience to the sacred law.”

The second questioner asks how a jihad could take place in Nigeria when there is no consensus over a leader, in contrast to the consensus that (if one has to believe to the lecture) existed in Afghanistan around the gure of Mullah Omar. Pantami answers that this was precisely the goal of his lecture; in other words, to point out the need to establish in Nigeria an overall Islamic leadership similar to Mullah Omar’s, before moving to the next step.

In Nigeria, continued Pantami (emphasis added), this is the time for correction (gyara) and preparation (isti‘dād): “How can you start a jihad,when your father is still going around without a beard? When your mother is still going around with a mere transparent veil (gyale) rather than with a full-length hijab?

“Any effort to start a jihad without having established correct Islamic practices is doomed to failure, and this is precisely the main lesson to draw from the Afghan Taliban, whose success was established upon their unwavering attachment to the Sunna. This is the reason, concludes Pantami with a new reference to the “Kanamma affair” and to his critical engagement with Yusuf, why “any attempt to start a struggle that you have seen me rejecting so far, [it was because] it was not led by scholars and there was no understanding of the Sunna.” Thus the second question, focused on the possible implementation of jihad in Nigeria, was answered with a call for postponement (irjā’, Yusuf would say).

The third questioner asks how to make sense of the alliance between Saudi Arabia and the western countries fighting Al-Qaeda, such as the United Kingdom and the United States. Unfortunately, the recording stops before one can listen to Pantami’s answer.

Isa Pantami - A Jihadi Gradualist in Sheep's Clothing

According to a 2017 paper published by the US Institute of Peace and the Wilson Centre, Al Qaeda's jihadi tactics have morphed over the years from ""shock and awe"" events like September 11 to a strategy known as ""gradualism."" Explaining the subtle difference between open terrorism and gradualist terrorism, the paper says:

""ISIS is a political extremist actor, while al-Qaeda has become an extremist political actor. In other words, ISIS is more of an extremist movement with political goals. ISIS is unwilling to compromise; its behaviour is unlikely to change whatever the incentives. In contrast, al-Qaeda is now more of a political organisation with extremist beliefs, although that does not mean it can be co-opted. Both ISIS and al-Qaeda have long-term strategies to create a Salafist utopia. ISIS's core strategy is to pursue a Salafi state through continuous confrontations both within Muslim-dominated countries and outside them. ISIS believes muslims can be held to an interpretation of Sharia today.

[…] Al-Qaeda's strategy is more gradualist. It believes that Muslims must be educated first on Sharia, that the idea of jihad must be popularised, and that Muslims must be convinced to take up arms as the only method of emancipation. It is less exclusionary. It has forged alliances and quietly entrenched itself and its ideas within local communities with the aim of eventually building a pure salafi one.""

The irrefutable evidence of Isa Pantami's own pronouncements, hitherto hidden behind what he considered to be the veil of the Hausa and Arabic language tells a very clear story about exactly who Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami is, and what his existential goals are. It is no longer a conspiracy theory. There is now hard evidence.

At this point, the only course of action left is for President Muhammadu Buhari to quickly and unceremoniously fire Dr Pantami from his sensitive job where he sits on the National Executive Council and has access to the personal data of tens of millions of Nigerians. Nigeria can definitely do better than have an openly self-proclaimed Al-Qaeda sympathiser as its Minister of Communications and Digital Economy.

Meanwhile, it provides laid-off employees the freedom to look for a new job anywhere else they want. It’s an exciting new frontier for us, and, frankly, I only wish we’d thought of it sooner.” The report concluded that the new standard of office work might even give terminated workers the option to leave the city and move in with their parents while they sort some things out.

EU Delegation in Vienna/Handout via REUTERS

A new understanding is emerging at talks aimed at salvaging Iran's nuclear deal with global powers, Tehran's chief negotiator said on Saturday according to Iranian state media, as China's delegate also reported progress.

Abbas Araqchi said after a meeting of remaining parties to the 2015 deal that the Iranian delegation had submitted proposed texts on nuclear issues and the lifting of sanctions, and that work on a common text, ""at least in areas where there are common views"", could begin.

Iran has breached many of the deal's restrictions on its nuclear activities in response to the U.S. withdrawal and reimposition of sanctions against Tehran under President Donald Trump.

Araqchi was quoted as saying that, while serious disagreements remained, ""a new understanding appears to be emerging.""

The second round of talks began on Thursday in a luxury Vienna hotel. The United States, making a new diplomatic push in the Middle East under Joe Biden's administration, is not present as Iran has declined face-to-face negotiation.

However, European Union officials chairing the talks are carrying out shuttle diplomacy with a U.S. delegation based at another hotel across the road.

Negotiators are working on steps that both sides must take, on sanctions and nuclear activities, to return to full compliance, but the talks have been further complicated by an explosion at Iran's main uranium-enrichment facility at Natanz.

Iran has responded by saying it is enriching uranium to 60% fissile purity, a big step towards weapons-grade from the 20% it had previously achieved. read more

China's envoy to the talks earlier said all participants - China, Russia, France, Britain, Germany and Iran - had agreed to accelerate work on issues including which sanctions the United States would lift.

""All parties have agreed to further pick up their pace in subsequent days by engaging (in) more extensive, substantive work on sanctions-lifting as well as other relevant issues,"" Wang Qun told reporters.

Tehran says the Natanz blast was an act of sabotage by Israel and on Saturday named a suspect. Israel has not formally commented on the incident.

Wang, the only envoy who regularly speaks to reporters outside the talks, said remaining parties to the deal had resumed ""productive and constructive work"" over the past two days.

""In the next few days we hope the Joint Commission will immediately start negotiating the specific formula of sanction-lifting,"" he added, using the term for formal meetings of those parties.

0,Macron slams breakaway European football ‘super league’ plan,https://www.politico.eu/article/emmanuel-macron-european-super-league-football/,"French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Sunday their governments would support attempts to stifle the creation of a controversial European football “super league.”

As Europe’s top football clubs plan to defect imminently from UEFA’s elite competitions to set up a lucrative self-governed tournament, Macron said France would support “all the steps” taken by football’s governing bodies to defend Europe’s existing competitions. Johnson later added that creating a super league would be “very damaging for football and we support football authorities in taking action.”

According to one person familiar with behind-the-scenes discussions, the Italian and Spanish governments will echo that position.

Simmering talk of a breakaway league exploded earlier Sunday, when the Times reported that five of England’s so-called Big Six clubs had agreed to sign up to the new league. The New York Times later reported that 12 total clubs — six from England, three from Spain and three from Italy — had already agreed in principle to join the rebel tournament.

In France, where Qatari-backed behemoth Paris Saint-Germain have reportedly refused overtures to join the money-spinning breakaway competition, Macron said the proposal “threatened the principle of sporting merit.”

Reaction from European football chiefs to the proposal, which would upend decades of football governance in Europe and wrest control of the game away from the governing body, was also swift and vehement. In a joint statement, UEFA and Europe’s top national leagues called the proposal “cynical” and “founded on self-interest” — and delivered an unveiled threat.

“We will consider all measures available to us, at all levels, both judicial and sporting in order to prevent this happening,” the statement said.

In January, FIFA and UEFA threatened to ban any “super league” players from international tournaments, including the World Cup, a position which the EU supported and was echoed in Sunday’s UEFA statement.

At that time, European Commission Vice President Margaritis Schinas said, “There is no scope for the few to distort the universal and diverse nature of European football.”

In a statement, the European Parliament’s sports group condemned the “super league” proposal. It said that the breakaway competition would contravene the “values” championed by the group.

The European Club Association, which represents professional football teams in Europe, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(AP Photo/Darko Vojinovic)

GENEVA (AP) — A top official from the World Health Organization says Europe has surpassed 1 million deaths from COVID-19 and the situation remains “serious,” with about 1.6 million new cases reported each week in the region.

The comments by Dr. Hans Kluge on Thursday aimed to emphasize that Europe must keep up its guard with social distancing and speed up vaccinations as virus variants drive new infections to record levels in some nations.

Overall, a tally by Johns Hopkins University shows nearly 3 million deaths have been linked to COVID-19 worldwide -- with the Americas hardest hit, followed by Europe. The United States, Brazil and Mexico have reported the highest number of deaths, collectively at more than 1.1 million.

Speaking to reporters during a visit to Greece, Kluge did point to “early signs that transmission may be slowing across several countries” in WHO’s 53-country European region, which stretches into Central Asia —and cited “declining incidence” among the oldest people.

He said the proportion of COVID-19 deaths among people over 80, who have been prioritized for vaccines, had dropped to nearly 30% — the lowest level in the pandemic.

Britain in particular has seen new infections and COVID-19 deaths drop dramatically since January, due to a successful vaccination program and a prolonged national lockdown that is only being reversed in stages.

Full Coverage: Coronavirus pandemic

Addressing recent concerns about vaccines, Kluge also said the risk of people suffering blood clots is far higher for people with COVID-19 than for people who receive AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine.

“Let there be no doubt about it, the AstraZeneca vaccine is effective in reducing COVID-19 hospitalization and preventing deaths,” he said, adding that WHO recommends its use for all eligible adults.

1,Bush Says He Still Believes Iraq War Was The Fun Thing To Do,https://politics.theonion.com/bush-says-he-still-believes-iraq-war-was-the-fun-thing-1819569891,"WASHINGTON—Despite harsh criticism from both sides of the political aisle, the U.S. populace, and former members of his own administration, President Bush once again defended his 2003 decision to invade Iraq, saying that, in the end, it was the fun thing to do.

Bush asserts that the fight for freedom in Iraq is a blast.

""On Sept. 11, 2001, we as a nation faced a difficult decision, an important decision, a decision between what was fun and what was wrong,"" Bush said during a speech before Pentagon officials Wednesday. ""We could have backed down and allowed the terrorists to win. But instead, we stood up to the challenge before us, and we said, 'Bring it on—bring the good times on!'""

""Mark my words,"" Bush continued. ""When the dust settles and the smoke clears, history will look back on the Iraq War as a total blast.""

Throughout his speech, Bush remained unapologetic about his commitment to the ongoing mission to live it up in Iraq, repeatedly saying that sacrifices had to be made to ensure the most pleasurable course of action. The president also stated that he would not succumb to those who had pressured him to set a date for withdrawal, insisting that U.S. troops would remain in the region for as long as his administration was enjoying itself.

An Iraqi family trips the light fantastic in Basra.

""Withdrawing from Iraq when we're all having such a fantastic time would only serve to empower those intent on spoiling our fun,"" Bush said. ""And I have to say, right now, we're having a ball.""

Bush went on to defend his decision to remove troops from Afghanistan and ""bring the party"" to Iraq. He maintained that while policing the region wasn't ""a bore or anything"" it wasn't all that entertaining, either. Furthermore, the president said that had the United States not shifted its focus away from Afghanistan, military forces never would have had the opportunity to kick up their heels in Iraqi cities such as Basra, Baghdad, and Tikrit.

""Tell me 'Shock and Awe' wasn't an absolute riot,"" a visibly confident Bush said.

Bush maintained that he had no regrets about invading Iraq, and that all he needed to do to know he made the right decision was look at the smiling, happy faces of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Vice President Dick Cheney, and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.

Following the president's speech, Rice herself lashed out against critics of the war, painting them as ""real downers"" who wouldn't know how to let their hair down and have fun if their lives depended on it.

""I urge those who have grown tired of this war to lighten up and live a little,"" Rice said on CBS Evening News, adding that Bush had furthered his commitment to having a rip-roaring time in Iraq with a recent troop surge. ""What detractors of this war don't understand is that when it comes to fighting terrorism, there's no harm in letting loose and painting the town red.""

While Rice admitted that the Bush Administration could have better planned its exit strategy and more fully equipped troops to deal with the Sunni insurgency, she questioned how much fun that ultimately would have been for U.S. troops.

""The best times are had when there's no preparation in place. When everything is loud and spontaneous and you just throw caution to the wind,"" Rice said. ""Sure, we might have been able to prevent a massive civil war had we taken a few precautions—but come on, where's the joy in that?""

Bush, who claimed he could see America having a great time in Iraq for decades to come, and called the war in the Middle East the most fun the nation has had since Vietnam, agreed with Rice.

My fellow Americans, as I write this, the United States government is experiencing its first shutdown in 17 years. Democrats are quick to place blame on the Republican Party, and have accused us of taking this country hostage. President Obama has said our attempt to fund the government by defunding Obamacare is an attempt to extract a ransom solely for doing our jobs. He’s likened some members of our party to right-wing fanatics.

But let’s talk about Obamacare.

Three years ago, President Barack Obama passed a disastrous piece of legislation called the Affordable Care Act. He jammed this jobs-killing, deficit-increasing monstrosity through Congress, purely along party lines. And in 2010 the American people spoke loud and clear and elected a new wave of young Republicans to the House, which rejuvenated our party and allowed us to once again become the majority. This fresh crop of eager Republicans was elected to stop this president’s reckless spending and repeal Obamacare.

The American people sent us a clear message: Keep the government out of our health care and save this country.

And that’s what myself and my Republican colleagues are determined to do. Let me be clear: This is President Barack Obama’s government shutdown. This president consistently refuses to negotiate with Republicans about a piece of legislation that is confusing, drastically unpopular with the American people, and poisonous to our way of life.

Instead of coming to the table with Republicans, the president would rather talk to Vladimir Putin or the new president of Iran. Instead of improving the livelihoods of the American people, he would rather resort to name-calling. Instead of having a dialogue, he would rather call members of my party extremists and children and say they are on an ideological crusade. Instead of respecting my viewpoint, he would rather question my leadership and say the tail is wagging the dog.

Is this what people want from their president?

In the past two days, the Republicans in the House have passed numerous bills that would fund the government and get America’s health care system back on the right track. But each bill we pass has been rejected by the president and the Senate without so much as a debate. It seems like the Republican Party and our “team of extremists” are the only ones in Washington actually working to help the American people and get us out of this mess. If the president wishes to end this government shutdown that he created, then he must come to his senses and recognize that the public has spoken and Obamacare must go.

Help Me

Help me. Please, God, help me. I’ve lost control and I need help.

The far right members of my party are insane. I don’t know what they’re thinking, and I don’t want to know because it would be too horrifying. I’ve tried to explain it to them over and over and they don’t listen to me. They don’t listen to anybody. I say to them, nobody wants a government shutdown, Obamacare is the law of the land, the president was reelected and elections have consequences, and we are only in charge of one branch of government.

I say all of that and they just look at me with these cold, dead eyes. Christ, It’s chilling.

Look, these people scare me. They scare all of us. Have you heard them talk? They’re animals, these people. There are only 30 or 40 of them and we outnumber them, but they have so much power, you see? They could end me like that. And they wouldn’t feel a thing because these people do not feel. They are out for blood: my blood, the president’s blood, the blood of any American who doesn’t agree with them.

I hate them. I hate all of them. And yet I also fear them.

I want to admit something: I’ve cried in my office every day for the last month. During this shutdown I’ve sat there, panicked and alone, scared to death about the next thing they’ll make me do. When they knock on my door, my heart stops. What are they going to make me say next? How are they going to force me to embarrass myself next? Did you know I was once known as a relatively moderate, shrewd politician? That was before 2010. Before the horror began.

They haunt my dreams at night. I have this one nightmare where I’m about to ask for a vote on a clean continuing resolution and then one of them—I think it’s Steve King from Iowa—looks at me with this eerie smile and says, “No, John. No you won’t.” And then the rest of them are suddenly standing behind him and they all chant in a chilling monotone, “No, John. No you won’t.” And then I wake up screaming, “No, John!!! No you won’t!!!” and I’m crying, and my wife is crying, and I’ve sweat through my sheets.

Help me. Help me make this end. Don’t reelect these people. Reelect good, normal people and I promise I’ll be a good speaker from now on. I won’t lie down for the president by any stretch of the imagination, but I’ll work with him if it makes sense and I’ll fight him when it makes sense. That’s how it should be. That’s how it will be if you help me destroy this menace.

I know I helped create this monster, and I apologize. I am so, so sorry. I thought I could control it, but I was wrong. I just need your help to defeat it. Will somebody please help me? Please? Please? Anyone?

0,‘Not what we’d hoped for’: UK military chief disappointed over US withdrawal from Afghanistan,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/afghanistan-military-troops-withdrawal-defence-b1832722.html,"Britain’s military chief has expressed disappointment at president Joe Biden’s decision to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan.

General Sir Nick Carter, the Chief of the Defence Staff, said it was “not a decision we hoped for” but added that the UK respected the stance taken by the new administration.

His comments come after Mr Biden announced this week that the 2,500 remaining troops would leave Afghanistan by 11 September, the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on the US.

This marked an extension of the 1 May deadline set by his predecessor, Donald Trump.

Mr Biden said: “It’s time to end America’s longest war. It’s time for American troops to come home.”

Nato allies including the UK confirmed they would also withdraw their armed forces. Britain is to begin pulling out its remaining 750 military trainers from next month.

Gen Carter acknowledged the final withdrawal of international forces after two decades could lead to a return of the warlords but said the situation may not be “quite as bad” as some were predicting.

He told BBC Radio 4’s Today: “It is not a decision that we hoped for but we obviously respect it. It is clearly an acknowledgement of an evolving US strategic posture.”

He said he felt a “great deal of pride” at what the British armed forces had achieved during their time in the country.

“We went into Afghanistan back in 2001 to prevent international terrorism ever emerging from Afghanistan,” he said.

“In the last 20 years there has been no international terrorist attack mounted from Afghanistan. I think that is a great tribute to our armed forces and of course to the armed forces of the Nato countries that have been committed to this.”

Gen Carter said Afghanistan had “evolved hugely” over the past 20 years, while the Taliban had also changed during that time.

The Taliban refers to itself as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. While it stopped attacking international forces as part of national peace talks, it has continued to fight the Afghan government.

The BBC reported that last month, the Taliban threatened to resume attacking foreign troops that remained in the country on 1 May. The group’s “shadow mayor” in the Balkh district, Haji Hekmat, told the broadcaster: “We have won the war and America has lost.”

Some individuals involved in peace talks with the Taliban said Mr Biden’s decision to pull troops out has jeopardised Washington’s efforts and increased the chances of an upsurge in violence.

Ashley Jackson, from the Overseas Development Institute, said: “Biden’s announcement decreases any leverage the international community has left over them, and helps the Taliban justify refusing to attend.”

But Gen Carter believes the Taliban “is not the organisation it once was”.

“It is an organisation that has evolved in the 20 years that we have been there and I think they recognise that they need some political legitimacy,” he said.

“I would not be surprised if a scenario plays out that actually sees it not being quite as bad as perhaps some of the naysayers at the moment are predicting.

“The Afghan armed forces are indeed much better trained than one might imagine. I think they could easily hold together and all of this could work out. We will just have to see.

“At the end of the day, the Afghan people are looking for stability, they are looking for peace, and that is not lost on the Taliban.”

Plus, it honestly feels like by filming him, I’d be inserting myself into his narrative, and if it’s my body camera, it really seems like I’m trying to make his death all about me. Not committing this violent tragedy to film is just the respectful thing to do.” The NYPD added that it seemed exploitative to publicize the man’s death because that would be what people remembered about him, so the department was refraining from releasing any details about the incident to respect his privacy.

They have been given 48 hours to leave the country.

Why Czechia is expelling Russian diplomats

On October 16, 2014, there was a blast at a warehouse containing 58 tonnes of ammunition near the eastern Czech village of Vrbetice.

It was followed months later by another big explosion at a nearby warehouse with 98 tonnes of ammunition.

""The explosion led to huge material damage and posed a serious threat to the lives of many local people, but above all it killed two citizens,"" Babis said.

Babis said Czech authorities had ""clear evidence"" linking GRU Russian intelligence agency officers from unit 29155 to the blasts, after receiving information on Friday.

The expelled Russians have all been identified as members of their country's SWR and GRU intelligence services.

Babis added: ""The Czech Republic is a sovereign state and must adequately react.""

But Russia hit back at the accusations. The Interfax news agency cited Vladimir Dzhabarov, first deputy head of the upper house's international affairs committee, as saying Prague's claims were absurd and Russia's response should be proportionate.

Prague on Sunday said it would inform its NATO and European Union allies about its latest findings.

Police hunt for Skripal suspects

Meanwhile, the Czech organized crime squad (NCOZ) said it was looking for two men using Russian passports in relation to the explosions.

The names in the passports are

Alexander Petrov, born in 1979, and Ruslan Boshirov, born in 1978.

Czech police are looking for two men traveling on Russian passports with the same names as the suspects in the attempted 2018 Skripal poisoning in the UK

The names match those of the two people wanted in Britain over the poisoning of double Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury in 2018.

The suspected GRU members are said to have been present in the Czech Republic for six days in mid-October 2014, visiting the region where the ammunition depot is located.

Politicians routinely symbolically call for their opponents’ heads to be mounted on pikes on the White House lawn, and people know exactly what that means.” At press time, Schoen added that Trump’s repeated claims of election fraud were actually just his unique way of advocating for a peaceful transition of power.

1,BREAKING: ‘The Onion’ Has Obtained The IRS Tax Form 1040,https://politics.theonion.com/breaking-the-onion-has-obtained-the-irs-tax-form-104-1845206128,"The duty of a free press has always been to provide readers with a comprehensive and unvarnished picture of the world writ large. Though governments and their officials may strive to conceal vital documents from the public eye, The Onion insists that true journalism consists in shedding light upon even the darkest corners of our society. That is why today, thanks to the intrepid actions of one anonymous source, our editorial board has chosen to reveal that it possesses a copy of the IRS tax form 1040.



Advertisement

The revelations from these pages are, to put it bluntly, monumental.



Since receiving the tax form—often considered one of the most hotly sought-after records in recent American history—our substantial team of 327 fact-checkers, reporters, and legal experts have spent tireless nights to trawl through its depths, extracting explosive details about the function of standardized deductions for heads of household and married couples filing separately. Although the 1040 form pages fell into our editorial department’s hands in early 2019, it has taken nearly 18 months of around-the-clock examination to fully grasp its precise scale and ramification for the American people.



Indeed, the document tells a far different and potentially more damning story than the rumor mill surrounding the 1040 have suggested: earned income credit, Alaska Permanent Fund dividends, dependents. For years, the role of such terms—long presumed by our editorial board to be crucial components in understanding income tax filing—have been discounted as overblown hearsay. Yet here, they offer tantalizing glimpses at a larger whole, filling in the picture to render a dizzying understanding of precisely how and why an individual would file, say, using joint marital status.

We have chosen to publish our understanding of these records despite the extraordinary legal and physical threats that we will likely face. Additionally, in a contentious election year between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden we will surely face blowback from pundits for potentially upending the race with the explosive details about the form’s “wages, salaries tips, etc...” section and what it implies about the elusive form known only as W-2.

Of course, uncertainties will continue to dog our investigation: Namely, what is the form 1099-INT or the form 8888? And how does “adjusted gross income” differ from “taxable income”? What is the total income after adding lines 1, 2b, 3b, 4b, 4d, 5b, 6, and 7a? Such answers lie beyond our power as faithful custodians of the truth to furnish without delving into the rank speculation that has long plagued other lesser news outlets.

Nonetheless, we are confident that publication of the form known as 1040 represents the proper step forward for the truth, for The Onion and for the nation as a whole. These pages represent perhaps the most detailed look yet at the government’s dealings in taxation, and despite the tremendous risks we incurred through their procurement, it is incumbent upon us as stewards of the great journalistic tradition of truth-telling to provide these documents to the public. May the American people deal with them thoughtfully, and may a benevolent God guide our hand in reacting to their terrifying implications.

Australia closed its borders to all non-citizens and non-residents in March 2020 and has been permitting only limited international arrivals in recent months, mainly its citizens returning from abroad.

The border closure, together with snap lockdowns, swift contact tracking and high community compliance with health measures, have made Australia one of the world’s most successful countries in curbing the pandemic, limiting coronavirus cases to under 29,500 infections and 910 deaths.

“Australia is in no hurry to open those borders, I assure you,” Morrison said at a televised briefing.

“I will not be putting at risk the way we are living in this country which is so different to the rest of the world today.”

For months now, except for some short snap lockdowns, Australians have been able to dine out, gather nearly freely and stop wearing face masks in most places.

They exchanged their international forays for local trips, with government figures showing big annual increases in intra-state travel in the first months of 2021.

From Monday, Australians and neighbouring New Zealanders will be able to travel between both countries without the need to apply for an exemption or spend time in mandatory quarantine.

New Zealand has had only 2,239 confirmed coronavirus cases and 26 related deaths.

Morrison flagged on Sunday that vaccinated Australians could be able travel overseas “for essential purposes” and return via home quarantine in the second half of the year, but that possibility is only in “planning stages”.

Australia recently abandoned a goal to vaccinate nearly all of its 26 million population by the end of 2021 following advice that people under the age of 50 take Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine rather than AstraZeneca’s shot.",309,1964,13,71

MOSCOW (AP) — A doctor for imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who is in the third week of a hunger strike, says his health is deteriorating rapidly and the 44-year-old Kremlin critic could be on the verge of death.

Physician Yaroslav Ashikhmin said Saturday that test results he received from Navalny’s family show him with sharply elevated levels of potassium, which can bring on cardiac arrest, and heightened creatinine levels that indicate impaired kidneys.

“Our patient could die at any moment,” he said in a Facebook post.

Anastasia Vasilyeva, head of the Navalny-backed Alliance of Doctors union, said on Twitter that “action must be taken immediately.”

Navalny is Russian President Vladimir Putin’s most visible and adamant opponent.

His personal physicians have not been allowed to see him in prison. He went on hunger strike to protest the refusal to let them visit when he began experiencing severe back pain and a loss of feeling in his legs. Russia’s state penitentiary service has said that Navalny is receiving all the medical help he needs.

Navalny was arrested on Jan. 17 when he returned to Russia from Germany, where had spent five months recovering from Soviet nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin. Russian officials have denied any involvement and even questioned whether Navalny was poisoned, which was confirmed by several European laboratories.

Asked about Navalny’s worsening condition, U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters Saturday: “It’s totally totally unfair and totally inappropriate. On the basis of having the poison and then on a hunger strike.”

Jeff J Mitchell/Pool via REUTERS

The ruling Scottish National Party pledged on Thursday to hold an independence referendum by the end of 2023, a step that could fracture the United Kingdom by ripping apart the 314-year union between England and Scotland.

If there was another referendum and the Scots voted out, it would mark the biggest shock to the United Kingdom since Irish independence a century ago - just as London grapples with the impact of both Brexit and the COVID-19 crisis.

Scotland voted against independence by 55% to 45% in 2014, but Nicola Sturgeon's Scottish National Party (SNP) wants another referendum if it wins the Scottish Parliament election on May 6. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly dismissed SNP calls for a referendum.

""We believe the people of Scotland should have the opportunity in a referendum when the COVID crisis is over to decide whether Scotland should be an independent country,"" the SNP said in its manifesto published on Thursday.

""The SNP intention is for the referendum to be within the first half of the five year term,"" the SNP said, adding that the date of the referendum would be ""determined by our democratically elected parliament"".

Although Johnson has the power to refuse another independence vote he would likely face a constitutional showdown with Scotland.

The SNP said that if it won a majority in May then the Scottish Parliament would pass a referendum bill, which proposes that the question on the ballot be: ""Should Scotland be an independent country?""

""There can be no moral or democratic justification for Boris Johnson or any Westminster government to obstruct the right of the people of Scotland to decide their own future,"" the SNP said.

The SNP currently has 61 of the 129 seats in the Scottish Parliament but by working with the Greens' 5 lawmakers, it has effective control of the devolved parliament.

The nations of Britain have shared the same monarch since James VI of Scotland became James I of England in 1603 and a formal union created the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707.

But Brexit - and Johnson's handling of the COVID-19 crisis - have strained the ties that bind together England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales into the United Kingdom.

The United Kingdom as whole voted 52%-48% to leave the EU in a 2016 referendum: England and Wales voted to leave but Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to stay.

0,Russian envoy says ‘there is no famine’ in North Korea,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/15/russian-envoy-says-there-is-no-famine-in-north-korea,"Ambassador’s comments come days after Kim Jong Un said North Korea was facing its ‘worst-ever situation’.

The Russian ambassador in Pyongyang has described life as difficult in North Korea because of a halt in foreign trade amid international sanctions and coronavirus-linked border closures, but said there was no famine in the isolated and impoverished country.

Alexander Matsegora’s comments, published by Russia’s TASS news agency on Wednesday, came days after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un declared that his country was facing its “worst-ever situation”.

Kim also urged ruling party officials to wage another “Arduous March” of work and sacrifice, linking the current economic crises to a period in the 1990s of famine and disaster.

The Russian ambassador, one of the few foreign envoys in the country, said while it was unclear exactly what Kim meant, the current situation could not be compared to that period.

“Thank god, it is a long shot from the Arduous March, and I hope it would never come to that,” he said. “I remember well what happened here in late 1990s and I can compare.”

He added, “The most important thing is that there is no famine in the country today.”

Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, left, walks with Russia’s Ambassador to North Korea Alexander Matsegora, right, at Pyongyang International Airport on May 31, 2018 [File: Kim Won-Jin/AFP] Experts say Kim is facing perhaps the toughest moment as he approaches 10 years in rule, with government mismanagement, sanctions, floods and border lockdowns hobbling North Korea’s economy.

The United Nations meanwhile has warned of possible food shortages and other humanitarian disasters.

‘Decent local tea’

Matsegora, however, said while imported goods had effectively disappeared from store shelves, most domestic products were still available and prices had only increased moderately.

“There is no deficit felt in the main grocery products category,” he told TASS. “The prices grew, but moderately and not for all products.”

For instance, coffee, which “one hasn’t been able to buy here for awhile” has now been replaced with a “mug of very decent local tea”, he said.

It was unclear whether Matsegora’s comments applied to areas outside the relatively prosperous capital, Pyongyang.

The ambassador also said North Korea was building “large disinfection complexes” which would soon be completed, allowing some cross-border trade to resume soon.

“There is information that this work will finally be completed by the end of April, after which the flow of goods should be restored,” he said.

The move would allow North Korea to bring in international aid that has been stuck in warehouses on the Chinese side of the border. Pyongyang’s self-imposed border closures were aimed at preventing a coronavirus outbreak, but it has slowed trade that was already constrained by sanctions over North Korea’s nuclear weapons to a trickle.

Matsegora said while cross-border freight traffic could resume “in the near future”, passenger travel would only be allowed when the pandemic was resolved at a global level.

North Korea has not reported a single case of COVID-19, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), but South Korean and American officials doubt that claim.

The country is expected to receive nearly two million doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford COVID-19 vaccine by the first half of this year under the COVAX vaccine-sharing programme, but the North Korean population had been told virtually nothing about the international vaccines, Matsegora said.

The Russian ambassador is one of the few foreign ambassadors to remain in Pyongyang after some other delegations pulled out, citing the difficulty of rotating new staff.

Russia’s diplomatic mission recently complained about acute shortages of essential goods such as medicine, problems getting healthcare and pandemic restrictions that it said were unprecedented in their severity.

Still, Matsegora said Russian diplomats were much better off than other foreigners as Russia had “a large autonomous complex” in Pyongyang with “everything necessary for work and life, including a school, exercise facilities, a kindergarten, and an infirmary”.

“Nobody else has something like this in Pyongyang. So, as opposed to other diplomatic missions, we managed to almost completely retain our staff,” he said.

The ambassador added that there were signs that authorities were easing some of the domestic anti-pandemic measures, with weddings allowed and talk that classes in schools would resume this month.",705,4556,10,54
0,"""Strong Evidence"" Covid Predominantly Spreads Through Air: Lancet",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/lancet-study-sheds-light-on-10-scientific-reasons-why-coronavirus-is-airborne-2415028,"Transmission rates of SARS-CoV-2 are much higher indoors than outdoors, the study found.

A new assessment in the medical journal Lancet has found ""consistent, strong evidence"" that the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, is predominantly transmitted through the air.

Therefore, public health measures that fail to treat the virus as predominantly airborne leave people unprotected and allow the virus to spread, according to six experts from the UK, USA and Canada, including Jose-Luis Jimenez, a chemist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) and the University of Colorado Boulder.

""The evidence supporting airborne transmission is overwhelming, and evidence supporting large droplet transmission is almost non-existent,"" Jimenez said. ""It is urgent that the World Health Organization and other public health agencies adapt their description of transmission to the scientific evidence so that the focus of mitigation is put on reducing airborne transmission.""

The team of experts, led by the University of Oxford's Trish Greenhalgh, reviewed published research and identified 10 lines of evidence to support the predominance of the airborne route.

At the top of their list: Super-spreader events such as the Skagit Choir outbreak, in which 53 people became infected from a single infected case. Studies have confirmed these events cannot be adequately explained by close contact or touching shared surfaces or objects.

Moreover, transmission rates of SARS-CoV-2 are much higher indoors than outdoors, and transmission is greatly reduced by indoor ventilation.

The team highlighted research estimating that silent (asymptomatic or presymptomatic) transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from people who are not coughing or sneezing accounts for at least 40 per cent of all transmission. This silent transmission is a key way COVID-19 has spread around the world, ""supporting a predominantly airborne mode of transmission,"" according to the assessment. The researchers also cited work demonstrating long-range transmission of the virus between people in adjacent rooms in hotels; people who were never in each other's presence.

By contrast, the team found little to no evidence that the virus spreads easily via large droplets, which fall quickly through the air and contaminate surfaces.

""We were able to identify and interpret highly complex and specialist papers on the dynamics of fluid flows and the isolation of live virus,"" lead author Greenhalgh said. ""While some individual papers were assessed as weak, overall the evidence base for airborne transmission is extensive and robust. There should be no further delay in implementing measures around the world to protect against such transmission.""

The new work has serious implications for public health measures designed to mitigate the pandemic. First, ""droplet measures"" such as handwashing and surface cleaning, while not unimportant, should be given less emphasis than airborne measures, which deal with inhalation of infectious particles suspended in the air.

If an infectious virus is primarily airborne, someone can potentially be infected when they inhale aerosols produced when an infected person exhales, speaks, shouts, sings, or sneezes. So airborne control measures include ventilation, air filtration, reducing crowding and the amount of time people spend indoors, wearing masks whenever indoors (even if not within 6 feet or 2 meters of others), attention to mask quality and fit, and higher-grade PPE for healthcare and other staff when working in contact with potentially infectious people.

""It is quite surprising that anyone is still questioning whether the airborne transmission is the predominant transmission pathway for this virus or not,"" said co-author Professor Kimberly Prather, an aerosol scientist from the University of California San Diego. ""Only by including inhalation of aerosols at both close and long range can we explain the many indoor outbreaks that have occurred around the globe. Once we acknowledge this virus is airborne, we know how to fix it. There are many examples of places that have fared much better by acknowledging this virus is airborne from the start. The world needs to follow their lead as soon as possible.""",641,4262,8,65

Ashkenazi met in person with Cypriot Foreign Minister Nikos Christodoulides, Greek Foreign Minister Nicos Dendias and the Emirati minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash — with Emirati Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed joining them virtually.

The ministers held bilateral meetings before holding a four-way meeting; there are plans for the officials from the four countries to convene regularly, both at the ministerial and professional working levels.

At a joint press conference, Ashkenazi emphasized that Israel will do whatever is needed to ensure that Iran does not acquire nuclear weapons. “We also took time to discuss challenges that Iran and Hezbollah and other extremists pose to the stability of the Middle East and to the regional peace.” He said Israel will do whatever it takes to block malevolent actions and “prevent this regime from having nuclear weapons.”

After the meeting, Ashkenazi tweeted, “It is my pleasure to meet with my friends, the Foreign Ministers, and to discuss issues of great importance to the entire region with them, particularly Iran’s aggressive policy and the destabilization of the Middle East that results from it.”

Ashkenazi added, “Israel is determined to defend itself against any attempt to harm its sovereignty or citizens, and will do whatever it takes to prevent this radical regime from acquiring nuclear weapons and arming its proxies.”

The meeting was held against the backdrop of growing tensions between Israel and Iran, especially on the maritime front, and while discussions are undergoing in Vienna on a possible renewed nuclear agreement between Tehran and Washington. Still, the Iranian threat was just one of a series of issues discussed by the foreign affairs leaders of the four countries. Israel, Greece and Cyprus have been working closely together for several months now in the field of energy, with the Emiratis recently joining this alliance of regional energy cooperation. The leaders also discussed tourism against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic and other key economic issues. Similarly, the subjects of Turkey and Libya were also on the table.

Gargash said the UAE seeks an “ambitious and positive agenda in the region and the Abraham Accords were driven by the necessity of an alternative strategic view the region based on stability, prosperity and opportunity.”

But the greatest importance of the meeting may have been the framework created there, and the evident feeling of trust registered by its participants.

Still, it remains to be seen how Israel’s next foreign minister will take up this newly forged friendship. Ashkenazi did not run in the March 23 elections and is bound to step down from his post in the coming weeks.",459,2887,7,55
0,Russia: Prosecutors seek to outlaw Navalny’s activist network,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/16/moscow-prosecutor-seeks-outlaw-navalnys-activist-network,"State prosecutors in Russia have asked a court to label groups linked to jailed opposition leader Alexey Navalny as “extremist organisations”, a move that would ban them and expose activists to long prison terms.

Friday’s move, if approved, would mark one of the most serious steps taken by authorities yet to target the network of groups set up by the staunch critic of President Vladimir Putin who is on a hunger strike as he serves a two and a half year jail term.

Russia’s list of “extremist organisations” currently consists of 33 entities, including the ISIL (ISIS) armed group, the Taliban and Jehovah’s Witnesses. The presence of these groups is banned in Russia and participation in them can result in lengthy prison terms.

People caught organising the activity of such groups can be jailed for up to 10 years, people taking part in them can be held criminally liable and the groups themselves are prohibited from any kind of banking activity.

Prosecutor’s remarks

The Moscow state prosecutor said it had decided to appeal to the court after studying Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation and campaign groups that he has built up in regions across the country.

“Under the guise of liberal slogans, these organisations are engaged in forming the conditions to destabilise the social and social-political situation,” the prosecutor said in a statement.

“Effectively the goal of their activity is to create the conditions to change the basis of the constitutional order, including by using a ‘colour revolution’ scenario,” it said.

An outspoken Putin critic for years, Navalny has organised nationwide street protests and carved out a following online with investigations alleging corruption by senior Russian officials.

The 44-year-old, who was barred from standing for election against Putin in 2018, was jailed in February for parole violations he said were trumped up.

Navalny was arrested at the border as he returned to Russia from Germany where he had been recovering from poisoning by a nerve agent.

Most of his most prominent allies are either abroad or in Russia facing charges for violations relating to a series of demonstrations that were staged to protest against his jailing.

Separately on Friday, a court sentenced a cameraman who worked for Navalny’s team of activists to two years in jail for inciting “extremism”.

The charge related to an anti-government tweet he wrote after the self-immolation of a Russian journalist.

‘Political repression’

Navalny’s allies promised to carry on their work.

“Putin has just announced full-scale mass political repression in Russia,” key aide and head of Navalny’s regional network Leonid Volkov wrote on Twitter shortly after the announcement from prosecutors.

In a statement on Facebook, Volkov and FBK director Ivan Zhdanov said they had no doubts about the ruling that a “Putin’s court” would make but said they will continue their work “peacefully, publicly and effectively”.",468,2956,8,61
0,Russia Raids Home Of Journalist For Investigating Prominent Oil CEO,https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Russia-Raids-Home-Of-Journalist-For-Investigating-Prominent-Oil-CEO.html,"Russia’s security services raided the home of investigative journalist Roman Anin and took him in for questioning last week for what his lawyer says is connected to a past investigation Anin has published on the powerful chief executive of Russia’s oil giant Rosneft, Igor Sechin.

The Federal Security Service (FSB) of Russia searched the home of Anin on Friday, took him in for questioning at which Anin refused to answer questions, and later released him.

Anin, editor-in-chief of independent investigative media outlet iStories, wrote back in 2016 an investigative piece in Russian opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta, claiming that Igor Sechin, Rosneft’s chief executive and an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was connected with one of the most luxurious yachts in the world, St. Princess Olga. Sechin sued Novaya Gazeta for defamation and won the lawsuit in 2016.

The case was re-opened last month on the grounds of privacy violations, and Anin is listed as a witness.

Anin’s lawyer, Anna Stavitskaya, told the outlet New Prospect in an interview after Anin’s questioning on Friday that the Federal Security Service doesn’t lead the re-opened case but it is involved in it, “perhaps everyone sees why FSB—the case is connected with Sechin,” she said.

The European Union and investigative reporters’ associations expressed concern with the Russian questioning of Roman Anin.

“On the face of it, this appears to be a dark day for freedom of the media in Russia. We stand fully behind Anin’s fearless exposure of figures from the criminal and political underworld,” said Gerard Ryle, director of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).

The EU is concerned about the recent raid and the actions against Anin, Peter Stano, Lead Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, said in a statement.

“It is the duty of media to report on issues of public interest. State authorities should ensure that journalists are able to carry out their legitimate work and not hinder or intimidate them,” Stano said.

LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) — Pakistan briefly blocked access to all social media on Friday after days of violent anti-French protests across the country by radical Islamists opposed to cartoons they consider blasphemous.

Sites including Twitter and Facebook were blocked for four hours on orders from the country’s interior ministry, said Khurram Mehran, a spokesman for Pakistan’s media regulatory agency. He gave no further details.

The move comes as police officials prepare to clear a large demonstration in the eastern city of Lahore, and just hours after the government said the now-detained leader of the outlawed Islamist political party at the forefront of the protests had urged his supporters to stand down.

By releasing a note they say was handwritten by Saad Rizvi, the government hopes to calm tensions after his Tehreek-e-Labiak Pakistan party stirred up the violent protests — in which four police officers were killed and 600 injured. France urged its citizens to leave the country.

Three demonstrators also died in the clashes with security agencies, and the government has imposed a ban on the party with Prime Minister Imran Khan’s approval. Khan took to Twitter on Friday to pay tributes to policemen killed or injured in the violence. He said the violence was aimed at creating chaos and blackmailing his government.

Khan’s government also banned coverage of Rizvi’s party by the local media, while police registered cases against Rizvi for inciting violence that resulted in the killing of policemen.

A photo of the statement was released earlier by an advisor to the prime minister on Twitter, but neither Rizvi himself or any of his party leadership was immediately available for comment. Some of his followers insisted they hear or see the words come from Rizvi himself before stopping, and the Lahore protest continued after Friday prayers.

On Thursday, the French embassy in Pakistan advised all of its nationals and companies to temporarily leave the Islamic country, after violence erupted over Rizvi’s arrest.

Violent protests have ongoing in Lahore since Monday, damaging private and public property and disrupting the much-need supply of oxygen to hospitals. Some of the affected included COVID-19 patients, who were on oxygen support.

In the statement, Rizvi asked his supporters to peacefully disperse for the good of the country and end their main sit-in that began Monday, when police arrested the radical cleric for threatening protests if the government did not expel the French ambassador before April 20.

Rizvi’s arrest sparked violent protests by his followers, who disrupted traffic by staging sit-ins across the country. Although security forces cleared almost all of the rallies, thousands of Rizvi’s followers are still assembled in Lahore, vowing to die in order to protect the honor of Islam’s Prophet Muhammad.

Rizvi became the leader of the outlawed Tehreek-e-Labiak Pakistan party in November after the sudden death of his father, Khadim Hussein Rizvi. His party also wants the government to boycott French products.

Rizvi’s party has denounced French President Emmanuel Macron since October last year, saying he tried to defend blasphemous caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad as freedom of expression. Macron had spoken after a young Muslim beheaded a French school teacher who had shown caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad in class.

The images had been republished by the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo to mark the opening of the trial over the deadly 2015 attack against the publication for the original caricatures.

That enraged many Muslims in Pakistan and elsewhere who believe those depictions were blasphemous. Rizvi’s group in recent years became known for opposing any change to the country’s harsh blasphemy laws, under which anyone accused of insulting Islam or other religious figures can be sentenced to death if found guilty.

0,Wife of GB wrestling champion refused UK visa,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/visa-wrestling-champion-britain-mohammed-mokaev-home-office-b1832831.html,"The wife of a British wrestling champion who has won gold medals for the country has hit out at the UK’s “cruel” immigration rules after his wife was refused a visa.

Muhammad Mokaev, 20, a professional fighter who has won gold medals for Britain, said he was “surprised” when the Home Office declined to issue a visitor’s visa to his wife, Khava Eldarbekova, in February this year.

The refugee, who came to Britain with his family in 2012 after fleeing political persecution in Dagestan, Russia, had been hoping his Ms Eldarbekova, 25, whom he married by Islamic marriage in October 2020, would be able to visit the UK to meet his father for the first time.

But the Home Office refused the visa in February, saying they hadn’t provided enough evidence that she had sufficient ties to Russia, her home country, or Bahrain, where she currently lives, and that the department was “not satisfied” that she would leave the UK.

The couple applied for a second time with additional evidence, and it was refused again.

This time, the Home Office said Ms Eldarbekova had £4,884 in her bank account for which she did not “explain the source” and which they said therefore could have “been inflated for the purposes of obtaining an entry clearance”.

Mr Mokaev said the money had been the income from her job in medical therapy. He added: “It’s not a lot of money to hold on an account. It’s not criminal. We have no criminal record. She’s not going to stay in the UK illegally. We showed everything on the papers.

“And there was exactly the same amount of money in her bank account the first time but they didn’t include it in that refusal, only the second time it was an issue. Why didn’t they include it the first time?”

The 20-year-old, who is a six-time British wrestling champion, told The Independent the situation was impacting on his ability to perform in the sport.

“It is very hard to stay focused with this situation going on, not knowing what’s going to happen,” he said.

“In March I had a fight in Bahrain, but I had to be in a visa centre in the morning. I missed the bus going to the arena. I was meant to be there for media, medicals and signings for sponsors, but I was in the visa centre until 1pm to sort out the application. It was a headache.”

The couple spent around £2,500 on submitting the two applications, and the refusal letters state that there is no right of appeal, so they have no option but to pay for a third application or give up.

The athlete said it was not the first time he had faced issues with the UK immigration system.

His family’s refugee application took five years to be processed, and now – due to the rule that a refugee must wait five years before applying for British citizenship – he is unable to compete in a number of major international competitions.

Mr Mokaev said he had been picked to compete in both the Tokyo Olympics later this year and the Commonwealth Games 2022 in Birmingham, but that despite his efforts to request his application is expedited to allow him to take part, the Home Office had declined.

“I’ve missed the opportunity of the Commonwealth Games in 2022, I missed Tokyo 2021 which is happening in 99 days, and now they’ve declined my wife’s visa. It’s getting crazy.

“And it’s not just me, it’s many people they do this to. I don’t like to say it but the Home Office is treating people badly.”

Human rights lawyer Shoaib Khansaid the decision to refuse Ms Eldarbekova’s visa was “absolutely disgusting, cruel and nasty”.

He added: “The immigration rules are awful and Priti Patel’s Home Office enforces them in an even worse way. Solidarity with Muhammad and the thousands of perfectly decent, law-abiding families needlessly separated by the Tories.”

Arna Kimiai, 24, entered pleas Monday to felonies of assault and attempted first-degree robbery along with misdemeanor charges of battery on a transit employee and violating a local health ordinance. She remains free on bail pending a May 3 hearing.

Kimiai is accused of attacking Subhakar Khadka, 32, on March 7 after he had picked up three passengers in the Portola district but then stopped the car because he noticed she wasn’t wearing a face mask, which was required under anti-COVID-19 health orders.

REUTERS/Ints Kalnins

There is a ""low to medium"" risk that Russia will invade Ukraine over the next few weeks, the top U.S. general in Europe said on Thursday, in the first such military assessment amid mounting concern about Russian troop movements toward Ukraine's borders.

Air Force General Tod Wolters declined to explain the intelligence driving his assessment, which does not suggest that the U.S. military expects a Russian invasion at this point, but he is not ruling one out or playing down the risk.

But, in testimony before a House of Representatives committee he later suggested his view about the risks in the coming weeks and months was at least partly based on the disposition of Russian forces.

The Pentagon has declined to detail its assessment on the size and composition of those troops, referring reporters to Moscow. However, the White House disclosed last week that Russia had more troops on Ukraine's eastern border than at any time since 2014, when it annexed Crimea and backed separatist territory seizures. read more

Asked by a lawmaker on the Armed Services Committee to estimate the chances of an invasion in the next few weeks, Wolters said: ""Low to medium.""

Pressed by another lawmaker to explain whether that risk would change after that period, Wolters kept his cards close, saying: ""The answer is, it depends.""

""And I would have to take each and every second of the day from this point till tomorrow to give you a different answer,"" said Wolters, who is both head of the U.S. military's European Command and is NATO's supreme allied commander Europe.

If the current trajectory stayed the same, however, Wolters estimated the risk of an invasion could decrease.

""My sense is, with the trend that I see right now, that the likelihood of an occurrence will start to wane,"" he told Congress members.

Ukraine and Russia have traded blame over a spike in violence in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian troops have battled Russian-backed separatist forces in a conflict that Kyiv says has killed 14,000 people since 2014.

Tensions over a buildup of Russian troops on Ukraine's eastern border have pushed up the cost of raising domestic debt and prompted the government to accelerate efforts to secure more International Monetary Fund loans, an adviser to Ukraine's president told Reuters on Thursday.

The United States sought to impose costs on Russia on Thursday by imposing a broad array of sanctions, including curbs to its sovereign debt market, to punish it for interfering in last year's U.S. presidential election, cyber-hacking, bullying Ukraine and other alleged ""malign"" actions. read more

Laura Cooper, deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, pointed to the sanctions and described the conflict in eastern Ukraine as ""a hot war right now.""

""Since January, we've already had 30 Ukrainian service members killed in the east,"" Cooper testified, speaking alongside Wolters.

Still, both Cooper and Walters did not request additional authorities to support Ukrainian forces, which started receiving anti-tank weapons and other weaponry in recent years from Washington.

""I think we have the right authorities and we have been able to provide the right lethal assistance, again, both on the land domain and the maritime domain at this point,"" Cooper said.

The English conquest of Ireland in the 17th century was brutal, motivated by fear of invasion and facilitated by the superiority of Cromwell's army. The English takeover of Scotland in the 18th century was more pragmatic, born out of Scottish bankruptcy after an ill-fated American investment and English worries about France. But the resulting union was more than the sum of its parts: it gave birth to an intellectual and scientific revolution, centred on Edinburgh as well as London; an industrial revolution which grew out of that, enriching Glasgow as well as Manchester and Liverpool; an empire built as much by Scots as Englishmen; and a military power which helped save the world from fascism.

That union is now weaker than at any point in living memory. The causes are many, but Brexit is the most important. Political leaders in London, Edinburgh and Belfast have put their country at risk by the way they have managed Britain’s departure from the European Union.

Boris Johnson, the prime minister, has done it carelessly, by putting party above country and espousing a hard Brexit. The Scots never wanted to leave the EU and are inclined to seek a future outside the UK . In the past year opinion polls have shifted from a small majority backing the union—broadly the pattern since a referendum rejecting independence in 2014—to a small majority backing departure.

Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister and leader of the Scottish National Party, has done it determinedly, by exploiting Scots’ dislike of the Brexit settlement. The ills of fishermen unable to sell their catches are blamed on Westminster. Polls suggest that, in the Scottish elections in May, the SNP will gain an overall majority in a system designed to avoid it.

Arlene Foster, first minister of Northern Ireland and head of the Democratic Unionist Party ( DUP ), has done it stupidly, by rejecting the softer Brexit proposed by Theresa May, Mr Johnson's predecessor. That would have avoided the vexed issue of how and where to create a border with the EU . Neither Brussels, nor Dublin nor London was prepared to create a hard border on the island of Ireland, so Mr Johnson created one instead in the Irish Sea, between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, weakening the union which the DUP exists to defend. That helps explain a week of rioting earlier this month. Resentments fester and, as the 100th anniversary of Irish independence nears, reunification has never looked closer.

If the Scots, Northern Irish or even the Welsh choose to go their own way, they should be allowed to do so—but only once it is clearly their settled will. That is by no means the case yet, and this newspaper hopes it never will be.

Breaking up a country should never be done lightly, because it is a painful process—politically, economically and emotionally. Ask the Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis or the Serbs, Croats and other former citizens of Yugoslavia. Few splits happen as peaceably and easily as that of the Czechs and Slovaks. Though it seems inconceivable that the citizens of today’s UK would start murdering each other, that is exactly what they did during the Northern Irish Troubles that ended less than a quarter of a century ago.

When not bickering about the constitutional question, the UK ’s constituent parts work together fine. England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland ran separate covid-19 lockdowns, adjusted to local rates and sensitivities. Vaccines, where scale counts, were run nationally.

The UK ’s survival matters more broadly, too. Although its historical record is hardly unimpeachable, it is on the side of democracy, human rights and transparency in a nasty world. No doubt its constituent parts would embrace similar values, but when independent England or Scotland piped up in defence of Hong Kong, they would be easily ignored—especially if they lost their permanent seat on the UN Security Council.

The fact that the survival of the union is now in Mr Johnson’s unreliable hands will bring no comfort to anybody who hopes it has a future. Yet he is concerned enough to have created a “union unit” within Downing Street, and put it under Michael Gove, one of his cleverest colleagues and the government’s only high-profile non-English minister.

Some of what Mr Johnson is doing is sensible. He is right to insist that now is not the time for another Scottish referendum. The last one, only seven years ago, was advertised as a once-in-a-generation opportunity. It is true that Britain’s circumstances have since changed, but Brexit is very recent, and opinion about it has not had a chance to settle. There should not be another referendum until polls show a clear and sustained majority for independence. Holding frequent referendums is a recipe for instability and an eventual end to the union: at some point the trigger and the bullet will coincide.

But the government is getting much else wrong. It should stop plastering the Union Jack everywhere. To those whose identity is primarily regional, it looks like a campaign that is designed to stamp Westminster’s ownership on all corners of the nation. It should use non-English figures more, including Ruth Davidson, the popular former leader of the Scottish Conservative Party. Mr Johnson also needs to stop lying. His dishonesty over the Irish Sea border, which he said would be created “over [his] dead body”, exacerbated his betrayal of the province. And he needs to improve Britain’s relations with Europe, including by aligning Britain’s food-and-agriculture standards with those of the EU —the main source of the trade friction that has infuriated Northern Ireland’s unionists. That would make a trade deal with America harder, but no such deal is on offer now, and none ever will be if the peace in Northern Ireland is put in jeopardy.

You only had two jobs

Mr Johnson was elected prime minister to “get Brexit done”. In carrying that out, he has endangered his country's integrity. His single most important task for the rest of his term in office is to hold the union together. If he fails, he will go down in history not as the man who freed the United Kingdom, but as the man who destroyed it. ■

The advancing force includes 1,300 battle tanks, 3,700 drones, 1,300 artillery and mortar units and 380 multiple launch rocket systems, according to documents leaked to the Daily Mirror.

Tensions between the countries have been escalating following Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea territory in 2014, an attempt by Moscow to keep NATO away from its borders. Ukraine is not a member of NATO, but support for the organization has risen in recent years, and the country is allied with many NATO nations — including the US.

Kyiv has claimed 14,000 people have died in the ongoing conflict, and many fear that Russian President Vladimir Putin believes that the COVID-19 pandemic is the right time to attack and control large parts of the country, according to the report.

The appearance of painted stripes on Russian armored vehicles headed to the front lines reminded military experts of similar stripes on tanks used by the Soviet army during the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Mirror reports. The stripes are used as a deterrent to friendly fire.

0,New report: Federal government subsidies and financing for fossil fuels reached nearly $18 billion in 2020,https://environmentaldefence.ca/2021/04/15/new-report-federal-government-subsidies-financing-fossil-fuels-reached-nearly-18-billion-2020/,"For Immediate Release: April 15, 2021

In advance of the federal budget, a new report from Environmental Defence shows that the federal government and its agencies increased financial support for oil and gas companies as country grappled with COVID-19

Ottawa, Ont. – A new report released today by Environmental Defence reveals that despite a decade of promises to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, Canada’s federal government announced a minimum of almost $18 billion to the oil and gas sector in 2020. In contrast, the Government’s new climate plan commits $15 billion to climate initiatives – spread over ten years.

The report, Paying Polluters: Federal Financial Support to Oil and Gas in 2020, estimates federal supports either announced or provided in 2020, including COVID support programs. This includes $3.28 billion in direct spending and $13.6 billion in public financing, primarily through crown corporation Export Development Canada. However, the exact amount of financial support from the federal government is difficult to specify due to a lack of transparency and public reporting. As a result, the numbers included here are certainly an underestimate of total support.

“For too long, Canadian governments have been propping up the fossil fuel industry, using tax dollars to fill the coffers of oil and gas corporations – the very companies and activities most responsible for the climate crisis,” says Julia Levin, Climate and Energy Program Manager at Environmental Defence. “Not only is this behaviour incompatible with ensuring a safe and healthy future – this is money removed from public budgets that could otherwise be spent on a just and green recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. We’re giving away wealth to oil and gas companies at the expense of the general public.”

Providing subsidies and public financing to oil and gas companies contributes to climate change, harms our health, diverts resources from public goods to private hands, yields very little in terms of job creation and distorts the energy market.

Canada first announced its commitment to phase out fossil fuel subsidies in 2009. As a result of a decade of inadequate action, Canada now provides more public finance for fossil fuels than any G20 country other than China – and the most on a per capita basis. Yet momentum to end public finance of fossil fuels among Canada’s peers and major trade partners is snowballing. The United Kingdom has already announced it will no longer provide public finance to overseas fossil fuel projects, and President Joe Biden has made eliminating fossil fuels subsidies and public finance a priority.

“Both the upcoming federal budget and Earth Day Leaders Summit on Climate are great opportunities for Canada to announce plans to redirect the support going to fossil fuels and instead put Canada on a path to a genuinely healthier and more resilient future, one that leaves no one behind,” says Levin. “As the government continues to provide unprecedented recovery fundings in response to COVID-19, now is the time to pursue a long-term, planned exit from fossil fuel production that avoids prolonging and deepening the chaos of the past few months, by providing ample support for workers and communities.”

Other key findings of the report include:

In 2020, an additional $15.35 billion was announced in programs, including as part of the new climate plan, that currently lack robust green strings and therefore could result in substantial fossil fuel subsidies if funds are directed to the fossil fuel sector (for example towards fossil fuel derived hydrogen or carbon capture).

A significant portion of the new support provided to oil and gas during the COVID-19 pandemic was under the guise of job creation and achieving environmental outcomes. These subsidies put taxpayers on the hook to clean up industry’s mess, and have not come close to achieving the intended job creation. Rather than spending the funds on additional reclamation work, the major oil companies that undertake the bulk of the work are simply replacing their own spending with federal funding.

Federal government agencies have played a key role in financing the construction of pipelines that have huge carbon footprints, violate Indigenous rights, and put ecosystems at risk. In 2020 alone, crown corporation Export Development Canada provided up to $5.25 billion in financing renewals for the Trans Mountain expansion (a project with an estimated total price tag of at least $12.6 billion) and approved a loan of up to $500 million for the Coastal GasLink pipeline.

Oil and gas companies claimed funds from COVID-support programs such as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS), while continuing to issue shareholder dividends. For example, Imperial Oil claimed $120 million through CEWS and issued $320 million in dividend.

Thomas Peter | Reuters

BEIJING — China reported first-quarter gross domestic product a touch below expectations as industrial production disappointed but retail sales beat. GDP soared 18.3% in the first three months of the year from a year ago, China's National Bureau of Statistics said Friday. That's slightly below expectations of a 19% increase, according to analysts polled by Reuters. The surge in growth comes off a contraction in the first quarter of last year, when the economy shrank by 6.8% during the height of the domestic outbreak of Covid-19. China was the first country to deal with the disease, and the economy returned to growth by the second quarter of last year. GDP expanded 10.3% in the first quarter when compared with the same period in 2019, the statistics bureau said.

China also said retail sales rose 34.2% in March, topping expectations of 28% growth. Industrial production rose 14.1% in March, missing Reuters' prediction of 17.2% growth. The slower growth in industrial production came despite more workers staying put during the Spring Festival and not traveling home for what can be a month-long holiday. The statistics bureau cautioned in an English-language statement that the spread of Covid-19 globally and the ""international landscape is complicated with high uncertainties and instabilities."" ""The foundation for domestic recovery is yet to be consolidated and long-standing structural problems remain prominent with new situations and issues arising from development,"" the bureau said. The urban surveyed unemployment rate ticked lower in March to 5.3%, but that of China's youngest workers aged 16 to 24 remained a high 13.6%, the data showed. ""Young people's employment problem still needs a period of time to be absorbed,"" said Liu Aihua, spokesperson of the National Bureau of Statistics, according to a CNBC translation of her Mandarin-language remarks. ""The total pressure in this aspect does exist."" She added that other surveys have found a shortage in general workers and high-skilled talent. Liu said the bureau recently found in a survey of more than 90,000 industrial businesses that a historically high ratio of 44% said hiring was their biggest problem.

Jon Rosenblatt with the menu in question.

""What's wrong with me?"" Rosenblatt asked fellow graduate student Amanda Kiefer following the incident. ""Am I completely losing my mind? I just wanted to order some food from Burrito Bandito. Next thing I know, I'm analyzing the menu's content as a text, or 'text,' subjecting it to a rigorous critical reevaluation informed by Derrida, De Man, etc., as a construct, or 'construct,' made up of multi-varied and, in fact, often self-contradictory messages, or 'meanings,' derived from the cultural signifiers evoked by the menu, or 'menu,' and the resultant assumptions within not only the mind of the menu's 'authors' and 'readers,' but also within the larger context of our current postmodern media environment. Man, I've got to finish my dissertation before I end up in a rubber room.""

At approximately 2 a.m., Rosenblatt was finishing a particularly difficult course-pack reading on the impact of feminism, post-feminism, and current 'queer' theory on received notions of gender and sexual preference/identity. Realizing he hadn't eaten since lunch, the Ph.D candidate picked up the Burrito Bandito menu. Before he could decide on an order, he instinctively reduced the flyer to a set of shifting, mutable interpretations informed by the set of ideological biases—cultural, racial, economic, and political—that infect all ethnographic and commercial ""histories.""

""Seeing this long list of traditional Mexican foods—burritos, tacos, tamales—with a price attached to each caused me to reflect on the means by which capitalist society consumes and subsumes ethnicity, turning tradition into mass-marketable 'product' bleached of its original 'authentic' identity,"" Rosenblatt said. ""And yet, it is still marketed and sold by the dominant power structure in society as 'authentic' experience, informed by racist myths and projections of 'otherness' onto the blank canvas of the alien culture.""

Added Rosenblatt: ""Then, of course, I realized that this statement was problematically narrow, since I was assigning an inherent 'actual' meaning to the Ethnicity Content of the take-out menu. Which was, in itself, contradictory to one of the primary theses of deconstruction, i.e., that it's impossible for an 'impartially' observing arbiter to establish any ultimate or secure meaning in a text. I'd just begun to make a mental note of the cartoon anthropomorphic burrito on the front of the menu as a signifier of such arbitrary 'otherness' when I yelled, 'What the hell am I doing?'""

Rosenblatt's inadvertent outburst nearly led to an altercation.

""I totally woke up my neighbor in the room across the hall,"" Rosenblatt said. ""He looked like he might hit me, so I tried reasoning with him, but it came out all wrong. Instead, I found myself saying that the multiplicities and contingencies of human experience necessarily pose a threat to the tendency of any arbitrary power or 'authority' to dictate oppressive hierarchical social structures or centralize power. Ergo, any attempt to establish hierarchies and centralized power according to arbitrary dichotomies of 'right' and 'wrong' behaviors was therefore not only morally and philosophically, but also politically problematic, and, in fact, oppressive. Man, did that ever not work.""

According to friends, Rosenblatt has been under a great deal of stress in recent months due to the financial strain of student-loan debts, his part-time tutoring job, and a heavy academic courseload.

""Lacking proper sleep and struggling to keep up in the intensely competitive crucible that is Harvard grad school, Jon is starting to lose it,"" said roommate Rob Carroll, 26. ""He has become so steeped in the complex jargon of critical theory that he's unable to resist the urge to deconstruct even the most mundane things.""

This is not his first time Rosenblatt has deconstructed a random item out of habit.

""The other day, we passed a bus stop with a poster for Disney's The Country Bears,"" said friend Karen Pilson, 26. ""I heard him mumble something about the incorporation of previously received notions concerning wildlife and our ecological environment into a reassuring, behavior-validating consumer commodity in the form of aggressively infantilized computer-animated pseudohumans that talk and play country music. Before I even had a chance to react, he went off the deep end and started throwing out terms like 'prenotional,' 'prolegomena,' 'gynocritical,' and 'logocentrism.' I was just stunned.""

Added Pilson: ""I told him he was worrying me and recommended a good psychiatrist. Bad move, because that prompted him to launch into a whole discussion of Foucault's 'Male Gaze' as it applies to mother/child pair-bonding in Lacanian psychoanalysis.""

In spite of his friends' concern, Rosenblatt seems unable to restrain his reflexive impulse to deconstruct.

""I can't help it,"" Rosenblatt said. ""Even when I close my eyes at night, I feel myself deconstructing things in my dreams—random stuff like that two-hour Dukes Of Hazzard reunion special or the Andy Warhol postage stamp or commercials for that new squeezable gel deodorant. I'd say I'm going crazy, but that presupposes an artificial barrier between societally preexisting concepts of 'sanity' and 'insanity' which themselves represent another false dichotomy maintained for the preservation of certain entrenched elements of the status quo and… Oh, God. I'm doing it again.""

Rosenblatt is considering taking a leave of absence from his graduate studies to spend several months living in his mother's basement in Elmira, NY.

Asked for comment, Professor Derek Nystrom of Skidmore College, an expert on deconstructivist thought, said that the Burrito Bandito take-out menu is open to many interpretations.

""The menu can be viewed an infinite number of ways, depending on viewer perspective,"" Nystrom said. ""None of these differing views would be any more or less 'correct.'

Even as the medium has surged in popularity and esteem, many still don’t consider it a “legit” art form. Fortunately, though, that stigma seems poised to change! In a major gaming win, a popular pro gamer did something terrible, and everyone is sweeping it under the rug like he’s a real celebrity!

Hell yeah, gaming aficionados! There looks to be a bright spot on the horizon for gamers everywhere after dozens of accusers have come forward against esports all-star Elton Tapowski (AKA SpytF1re) for unmentionable comments, verbal abuse, and inappropriate advances. Hordes of online commentators are already claiming you never really know what went on in cases like this, and that we should give him a pass! Folks, it’s like he’s an honest-to-god A-lister!



While you’d expect this response from the fans of a popular comedian, actor, or athlete, getting to see supporters claim that we have to separate the art from the artist—or that SpytF1re should get a lifetime pass for his incredible speedrun of Donkey Kong Country—shows just how far gaming have come.

It’s remarkable to think that even 5 or 10 years ago, SpytF1re’s unconscionable behavior would have been easily ascribed to a gamer’s creepy, basement-dwelling personality, and he might have even faced consequences. Today, though, taking actions that endangered the emotional and physical safety of another human being is quietly dismissed or outright ignored as though he’s just as valuable to society as a famous novelist or painter.



And if that wasn’t enough, esports fans are now taking it upon themselves to call Spytf1re’s accusers liars who are just trying to take down a good man for the attention and that they should kill themselves. If this sort of response, is any indication, it looks like the future of gaming is bright! Nice going, gamers!",314,1926,21,118

Steve Jurvetson on flickr

Elon Musk's SpaceX beat out teams led by Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin and Leidos subsidiary Dynetics to win a nearly $3 billion contract to build NASA's next crewed lunar lander. ""It is one more step, in an exciting group of steps, that will get us to a sustainable human landing system to the moon,"" Kathy Lueders, the leader of NASA's human spaceflight program, said in the agency's announcement. SpaceX's contract is worth $2.89 billion. The Washington Post first reported SpaceX's win on Friday.

NASA last year awarded the three teams with $967 million and 10-month contracts to begin work on the lunar lander concepts under its Human Landing Systems, or HLS, program. SpaceX was awarded the least amount of those three, with $135 million. Meanwhile, Dynetics received $253 million and Blue Origin had won $579 million. NASA was expected to choose two of the three teams, making the sole selection of SpaceX a surprise given the agency's prior goals for the program to continue to be a competition.

0,South Korean steelmaker to end partnership with Myanmar military,https://www.wral.com/skorean-steelmaker-to-end-venture-with-myanmar-military/19629775/,"— A South Korean steelmaker on Friday said it plans to end a joint venture with a military-controlled firm in Myanmar following criticism that its business has benefited military leaders who have violently suppressed pro-democracy protests there.

POSCO Coated & Color Steel said it has decided to discontinue its partnership with Myanmar Economic Holdings Public Company Limited, which is about 40% owned by Myanmar’s Defense Ministry. However, the South Korean company said it would not pull out of Myanmar.

POSCO C&C owns 70% of its joint venture with MEHL, Myanmar POSCO C&C. Min Ji-hyun, an official from POSCO C&C, said the company has informed MEHL it wants to buy the Myanmar firm’s 30% stake so that it can continue operating the venture with full ownership. MEHL has yet to respond to POSCO C&C’s offer, Min said.

Min said he couldn’t provide detailed estimates on how much the deal would cost POSCO C&C, saying that would depend on when it goes through. He said the company will look for “other ways” to continue doing business in Myanmar if MEHL refuses to sell its stake, but did not elaborate on what those might be.

Human rights activists have been pressuring many companies around the globe to end any financial support for the military. The U.S. government has imposed sanctions on MEHL and a similar military-controlled conglomerate, Myanmar Economic Corp.

POSCO C&C is an affiliate of South Korean steel giant POSCO that manufactures steel sheets. The company issued a statement saying it hopes its steel business will “continue to contribute in improving living environments in Myanmar and facilitate the country’s economy.”

A military junta took over Myanmar from an elected civilian government in a Feb. 1 coup. Security forces have killed at least 700 civilian protesters and bystanders, have detained the former government’s leaders, and have charged doctors, entertainers and others with crimes over their opposition to the coup.

In a statement, the rights group Justice for Myanmar said it cautiously welcomed Posco C&C's decision but urged it to “immediately end all other business ties with the Myanmar military junta and its conglomerates.""

That includes rent on land leased by entities associated with the military, it said.

The statement was jointly issued with the Korean Civil Society in Support of Democracy in Myanmar, a network of more than 100 rights groups. That group said that it had joined with other advocacy organizations to file a complaint with South Korea's National Human Rights Commission and other agencies to protest business ties between Korean companies and the military. That complaint was filed in November, long before the coup.",433,2691,9,64
0,Angela Merkel receives Astrazeneca vaccine (German article),https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/corona-aktuell-merkel-impfung-astra-zeneca-1.5261743,"Bundespräsident Steinmeier hat in einer zentralen Gedenkveranstaltung an die Verstorbenen in der Corona-Krise erinnert. Die Pandemie sei über die Menschen hereingebrochen, sie habe Wunden geschlagen, Lücken gerissen. Und sie sei immer noch nicht vorbei.

Viele Menschen seien im vergangenen Jahr einen einsamen und oft qualvollen Tod gestorben. 80 000 Menschen seien es in Deutschland. Drei Millionen weltweit. Und ""Tag für Tag sterben weitere"". ""Auch in dieser Stunde ringen Menschen auf den Intensivstationen mit dem Tod"", betont Steinmeier im Konzerthaus am Gendarmenmarkt in Berlin.

Er warnt davor, das Leid der Corona-Pandemie zu verdrängen. Sein Eindruck sei, ""dass wir uns als Gesellschaft nicht oft genug bewusst machen, dass hinter all den Zahlen Schicksale, Menschen stehen"", sagt Steinmeier. ""Eine Gesellschaft, die dieses Leid verdrängt, wird als ganze Schaden nehmen.""

""Sie alle fehlen - in ihren Familien und Freundeskreisen, in der Nachbarschaft, im Kreis der Kollegen, in unserer Gesellschaft"", sagt der Bundespräsident. Sie alle kämen nicht zurück. ""Aber sie bleiben in unserer Erinnerung. Wir vergessen sie nicht.""

""Sterben in der Pandemie das war und das ist oft ein Sterben ohne Beistand und ohne Abschied"", sagt Steinmeier. Es zerreiße das Herz und mache ""unendlich traurig"", zu wissen, dass Menschen sterben mussten ""ohne ein letztes zärtliches Wort, einen letzten liebevollen Blick, einen letzten Händedruck"".

Der Bundespräsident erinnert aber auch an Ärzte und Pfleger, die Tag und Nacht um jedes Leben kämpften, auch an Seelsorger, an all jene, die ""bis zuletzt für Sterbende da sind, die versucht haben, ihnen trotz allem einen Abschied in Würde zu ermöglichen"". Nicht wenige hätten sich dabei selbst angesteckt, einige seien gestorben.

Steinmeier machte das Leid der Hinterbliebenen deutlich, die ihre Angehörigen vor deren Tod nicht beistehen konnten. ""Es gibt keine Worte für ihren Schmerz."" Er verstünde ihre Verzweiflung und ihre Bitterkeit, die sich vorwürfen, ihre Liebsten im Stich gelassen zu haben.

Das Virus habe die Gesellschaft tief erschüttert. ""Die Politik musste schwierige, manchmal tragische Entscheidungen treffen, um eine noch größere Katastrophe zu verhindern."" Steinmeier appelliert daran, über Schmerz, Leid und Wut zu sprechen, sich aber nicht in Schuldzuweisungen und im Blick zurück zu verlieren: ""Sammeln wir noch einmal die Kraft für den Weg nach vorn, den Weg heraus aus der Pandemie, den wir gehen wollen und gehen werden, wenn wir ihn gemeinsam gehen."" Die Pandemie, die zum Abstand zwinge, dürfe nicht auch noch die Gesellschaft auseinandertreiben.

Gedenk-Gottesdienst: ""Tod und Sterben sind uns näher gerückt als zuvor""

Am Vormittag fand zum Gedenken bereits ein ökumenischer Gottesdienst statt. Bei beiden Veranstaltungen ist die Zahl der Teilnehmer wegen der weiter angespannten Pandemielage stark begrenzt. Teilnehmen dürfen unter anderem fünf Menschen, die Angehörige verloren haben, sowie die Spitzen der fünf Verfassungsorgane - neben Steinmeier Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel, Bundestagspräsident Wolfgang Schäuble, Bundesratspräsident Reiner Haseloff (alle CDU) und der Präsident des Bundesverfassungsgerichts, Stephan Harbarth.

Den Auftakt zum zentralen Gedenken an die Corona-Toten bildet am Vormittag ein ökumenischer Gottesdienst in der Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedächtniskirche. Der Ratsvorsitzende der Evangelischen Kirche in Deutschland, Heinrich Bedford-Strohm, sagt in seiner Predigt, in der Corona-Pandemie hätten viele ein Gefühl der Schuld, die beim Tod ihrer Angehörigen nicht für diese hätten da sein dürfen. Sie fragten sich: ""Warum habe ich die Kontaktbeschränkung hingenommen, mir den letzten Kontakt verbieten lassen?"" Er erinnert daran, wie wichtig es gerade in Zeiten der Trauer sei, nicht allein zu sein. ""Es ist eine Kraft da in der Gemeinschaft der Trauernden.""

""Krankheit, Sterben und Tod lassen sich in diesem langen Jahr nicht wegdrücken, sie schneiden tief ein in das Leben vieler Menschen"", sagt der Vorsitzende der katholischen Deutschen Bischofskonferenz, Bischof Georg Bätzing, in seiner Predigt. ""Tod und Sterben sind uns näher gerückt als zuvor."" Dabei seien Abschiede oft holprig und überstürzt gewesen, und es fehle so viel. ""Was hier alles fehlt, was einem an Nähe und Zuneigung geraubt wird durch die Pandemie, das verwundet die Seele.""

Neben Bedford-Strohm und Bätzing kommen auch Vertreter anderer Kirchen und Gemeinden zu Wort. Auch einige speziell von der Pandemie Betroffene berichten von ihren Erfahrungen. So schildert Joachim Huber, ein Redakteur aus Berlin, seine eigene Corona-Erkrankung im März 2020. Er habe fünf Wochen im Koma gelegen. Seine Tochter und Frau hätten ihn währenddessen nicht besuchen dürfen. ""Ich habe überlebt"", sagt Huber. Doch während er dies sage, würden schon wieder neue Infizierte in die Krankenhäuser gebracht. ""Die Infizierten werden kämpfen müssen.""

Julian Leukert, Intensiv-Pfleger in der Berliner, Charité, betreut seit einem Jahr Corona-Patienten, wie er berichtet. ""Während man in den Nachrichten die Zahlen sieht, sehe ich die Menschen hinter den Zahlen"", sagt er. Er habe emotionale Momente erlebt, in denen Menschen ihren letzten Weg alleine gehen mussten. ""Wir sind keine Superhelden"", betont er. Doch noch nie habe ihm eine Herausforderung so viel Kraft abverlangt.

RKI: 19 185 Neuinfektionen und 67 neue Todesfälle

Die Gesundheitsämter in Deutschland haben dem Robert Koch-Institut (RKI) binnen eines Tages 19 185 Corona-Neuinfektionen gemeldet. Zudem wurden innerhalb von 24 Stunden 67 neue Todesfälle verzeichnet. Das geht aus Zahlen des RKI von Sonntagmorgen hervor, die den Stand des RKI-Dashboards von 05.40 Uhr wiedergeben. Nachträgliche Änderungen oder Ergänzungen des RKI sind möglich. Am Sonntag sind die vom RKI gemeldeten Fallzahlen meist niedriger, unter anderem weil am Wochenende weniger getestet wird. Am Sonntag vor einer Woche hatte das RKI binnen eines Tages 17 855 Neuinfektionen und 104 neue Todesfälle verzeichnet.

Die Zahl der binnen sieben Tagen gemeldeten Neuinfektionen pro 100 000 Einwohner lag laut RKI am Sonntagmorgen bundesweit bei 162,3. Am Vortag hatte das RKI diese Sieben-Tage-Inzidenz mit 160,7 angegeben, vor vier Wochen hatte sie noch bei 129,7 gelegen.

Der bundesweite Sieben-Tage-R-Wert lag nach dem RKI-Lagebericht von Samstagabend bei 1,22 (Vortag: 1,24). Das bedeutet, dass 100 Infizierte rechnerisch 122 weitere Menschen anstecken. ""Der Sieben-Tage-R-Wert liegt über 1. Dies bedeutet weiterhin eine Zunahme der Fallzahlen"", hieß es im Lagebericht. Der R-Wert bildet jeweils das Infektionsgeschehen vor 8 bis 16 Tagen ab. Liegt er für längere Zeit unter 1, flaut das Infektionsgeschehen ab; liegt er anhaltend darüber, steigen die Fallzahlen.

Das RKI zählte seit Beginn der Pandemie 3 142 262 nachgewiesene Infektionen mit Sars-CoV-2 in Deutschland. Die tatsächliche Gesamtzahl dürfte deutlich höher liegen, da viele Infektionen nicht erkannt werden. Die Zahl der Genesenen gab das RKI mit etwa 2 775 200 an. Die Gesamtzahl der Menschen, die an oder unter Beteiligung einer nachgewiesenen Infektion mit Sars-CoV-2 gestorben sind, stieg auf 79 914.

Altmaier mahnt konsequente Anwendung von Ausgangssperren an

Im Ringen um eine Verschärfung des Infektionsschutzgesetzes hat sich Bundeswirtschaftsminister Peter Altmaier für die umstrittenen Ausgangssperren-Pläne starkgemacht. ""Die Ausgangssperre ist ein Signal für die Dramatik der Lage und dafür, dass wir es ernst meinen - gerade weil es sie bisher in Deutschland kaum gab"", sagt der CDU-Politiker der Frankfurter Allgemeinen Sonntagszeitung. Es gehe nicht um den Spaziergänger mit Hund, sondern um die Einhaltung der Kontaktregeln.

""Überall auf der Welt, wo eine Infektionswelle erfolgreich gebrochen wurde, hat man das mit dem Instrument eines harten Lockdowns geschafft"", betont der Minister. ""Auf der sicheren Seite sind wir, wenn wir insgesamt die Zahl der sozialen Kontakte reduzieren - und die entstehen, wenn alles geöffnet ist."" Daran seien alle differenzierte Modelle wie in Tübingen oder Rostock gescheitert.

Der Präsident des Deutschen Landkreistages, Reinhard Sager, kritisierte hingegen die geplanten Ausgangsbeschränkungen. ""Diese wären in Ihrer Pauschalität ein unverhältnismäßiger Eingriff in die Freiheitsrechte der Menschen, weil dem kein überlegener Effekt zur Verhinderung von Neuinfektionen gegenübersteht"", sagte er den Zeitungen der Funke Mediengruppe (Online Sonntag, Print Montag).

Auch die SPD-Fraktion fordert eine Abkehr von den Plan. Fraktionschef Rolf Mützenich wiederholte in der Bild am Sonntag die Forderung seiner Fraktion, Abendspaziergänge grundsätzlich zu erlauben. ""Es muss möglich sein, dass sich Erwachsene auch trotz aller Beschränkungen die Beine vertreten."" Zudem sagte Mützenich: ""Kinder müssen in Kleinstgruppen Sport treiben können. Zumal wir von Experten wissen, dass das Ansteckungsrisiko draußen um ein Vielfaches geringer ist als in geschlossenen Räumen.""

Scholz wirbt für bundeseinheitliche Notbremse

Die Debatte über den Nutzen der geplanten bundeseinheitlichen Corona-Notbremse reißt nicht ab. Vizekanzler Olaf Scholz wirbt in der Welt am Sonntag erneut für die entsprechenden Neuerungen des Infektionsschutzgesetzes. Wichtig seien ihm klare, einheitliche und lebensnahe Regelungen: ""Für die privaten Kontakte, für das Einkaufen, für Ausgangsbeschränkungen, von deren Nutzen ich weiterhin überzeugt bin. Es muss für jede und jeden nachvollziehbar sein, was gilt.""

Mit dem Gesetz soll es künftig bundeseinheitliche Regelungen für Corona-Maßnahmen geben. Überschreitet die Zahl der Neuinfektionen auf 100 000 Einwohner binnen sieben Tagen in einer Stadt oder einem Landkreis den Wert von 100 an drei aufeinander folgenden Tagen, müssen etwa Geschäfte geschlossen werden und es greifen Ausgangsbeschränkungen zwischen 21.00 und 5.00 Uhr.

Über mögliche Änderungen am bisherigen Entwurf des Infektionsschutzgesetzes könnte der Gesundheitsausschuss am Montag befinden. Eine Verabschiedung im Bundestag ist für Mittwoch vorgesehen. Der Bundesrat will sich am Donnerstag damit befassen. Scholz sagte, sicherlich werde in den laufenden Beratungen des Bundestags an der einen oder anderen Stelle noch ein wenig gefeilt. ""Ich erwarte aber keine wesentlichen Änderungen gegenüber dem Entwurf.""

Genau das fordern aber unter anderem die deutschen Landkreise. ""Der Gesetzentwurf muss an vielen Stellen korrigiert werden"", sagte der Präsident des Deutschen Landkreistages, Reinhard Sager, den Zeitungen der Funke Mediengruppe (Online Sonntag, Print Montag). ""Die reine Anknüpfung an Inzidenzen wird dem Pandemiegeschehen nach mehr als einem Jahr und den regional sehr unterschiedlichen Situationen nicht gerecht.""

Brandenburg beschließt nächtliche Ausgangsbeschränkung

In Brandenburg soll ab Montag eine Ausgangsbeschränkung zwischen 22 Uhr und 5 Uhr für Regionen gelten, in denen die Sieben-Tage-Inzidenz mindestens drei Tage lang über 100 liegt. Ab 200 Corona-Neuinfektionen pro 100 000 Einwohner in einer Woche sollen in Landkreisen oder kreisfreien Städten alle Schulen mit Ausnahme der Abschlussklassen und die Kitas geschlossen werden, erklärte Ministerpräsident Dietmar Woidke (SPD) am Samstag.

Lauterbach beklagt Farbanschlag auf sein Auto

Auf das Auto des SPD-Gesundheitspolitikers Karl Lauterbach ist nach dessen Angaben ein Farbanschlag verübt worden. Gestern habe es seinen geliebten Stadtwagen erwischt, twitterte Lauterbach am Samstag. ""Farbeimer, er sieht schrecklich aus. Auch die Scheiben, ich kann ihn nicht mehr fahren."" Der Politiker und Arzt, der in der Corona-Krise stark in der Öffentlichkeit stehen und für strikte Maßnahmen zur Eindämmung der Virus-Pandemie eintritt, äußerte sich allerdings kämpferisch: ""Aber wir werden nie aufgeben. Wir sind viele...""

Unterstützung erhielt er von der stellvertretenden Bundesvorsitzenden der Grünen, Ricarda Lang. Sie twitterte in einer Reaktion unter den Lauterbach-Äußerungen: ""Gestern wurden unsere Namen auf dem Klingelschild unserer Privatwohnung rot durchgestrichen. Politiker*innen werden immer öfter bedroht und eingeschüchtert. Aber wir werden die Angst nicht gewinnen lassen.""

Unternehmen wollen Impfaktion in Deutschland beschleunigen

Große Teile der deutschen Wirtschaft sind davon überzeugt, die Impfaktion gegen das Coronavirus beschleunigen zu können. Zahlreiche Unternehmen signalisierten in den vergangenen Tagen ihre Bereitschaft, Mitarbeiter von Betriebsärzten spritzen zu lassen. Noch reicht der Impfstoff dafür aber nicht aus. Mehr als Pilotprojekte sind bisher nicht absehbar - und in den Impfzentren der Konzerne ist Geduld gefragt.

Allein beim Autozulieferer Continental könnten in Deutschland in den werksärztlichen Diensten täglich mehr als 1000 Mitarbeiter geimpft werden, wie der Dax-Konzern aus Hannover auf Anfrage mitteilte. ""Unsere Betriebsärzte stehen bereit"", sagte Personalsprecherin Nicole Göttlicher. ""Konkrete Informationen von den zuständigen Behörden, wann wir hier aktiv werden können, liegen derzeit noch nicht vor.""

Für einen schnelleren Fortschritt werden nach den regionalen Impfzentren inzwischen auch Arztpraxen mit Impfstoff beliefert. Auf die Forderung, auch Impfungen in Betrieben rasch voranzutreiben, hatte Bundesgesundheitsminister Jens Spahn zuletzt mehrmals auf den wenigen verfügbaren Impfstoff verwiesen. ""Noch ist es zu knapp"", sagte er Ende März. Die Betriebsärzte sollten nach Hausärzten in die Impfaktion einsteigen.

In dieser Woche griff Berlins Regierender Bürgermeister Michael Müller die Forderung auf und schlug Beratungen zwischen Bund und Ländern vor. ""Wir haben darüber zu sprechen, wie wir die Haus- und Betriebsärzte noch besser einbinden, um schneller zu werden."" Spahn hatte mit Blick auf die Rangfolge gesagt, er finde es schwierig, jüngere Mitarbeiter von Unternehmen zu impfen, solange die Älteren noch nicht geschützt seien.

Dennoch wird in einigen Konzernen davon ausgegangen, dass es bald soweit sein könnte. ""Wir möchten sofort beginnen zu impfen, sobald Werks- und Betriebsärzte in die Impfkampagne eingebunden werden"", sagt Markus Siebenmorgen vom Pharmakonzern Bayer in Leverkusen. ""Nach der neuesten Impfverordnung erwarten wir, dass dies in Kürze der Fall sein wird."" Das Interesse der Mitarbeiter sei hoch, und das Unternehmen wolle die Impfungen auch gern auf Fremdfirmen an den jeweiligen Standorten sowie auf Familienangehörige ausweiten.

Tobias Hans gegen Voll-Lockdown

Der saarländische Ministerpräsident Tobias Hans (CDU) hält die geplante Änderung des Infektionsschutzgesetzes mit bundesweiten Ausgangsbeschränkungen für eine Fehlentscheidung. ""Wenn wir jetzt erneut völlig unkreativ in einen weiteren Voll-Lockdown gehen, wird das zwar irgendetwas helfen"", sagte Hans einem Vorabbericht der Welt zufolge in einem Interview. ""Aber es wird auch für viel Verdruss sorgen."" Nach 14 Monaten in der Pandemie könne sich ein modernes Land wie Deutschland, das sich auf die Fahnen schreibe ""auch technologisch vorne zu sein, doch nicht auf alle Alternativen verzichten, auf Kontaktnachverfolgungen per App etwa oder regelmäßiges Testen mit Nachweisen, die digital geliefert werden können."" Hans fordert ein intelligentes Steuerungsmodell, um mit dieser Pandemie auch mittel- und langfristig umzugehen.

Kanzlerin mit Astra Zeneca geimpft

Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) hat am Freitag ihre erste Corona-Schutzimpfung erhalten. ""Ich freue mich, dass ich heute die Erstimpfung mit Astra Zeneca bekommen habe"", teilte Merkel über ihren Regierungssprecher Steffen Seibert per Twitter mit. Sie fügte hinzu: ""Ich danke allen, die sich in der Impfkampagne engagieren - und allen, die sich impfen lassen. Das Impfen ist der Schlüssel, um die Pandemie zu überwinden."" Die Kanzlerin ist 66 Jahre alt und fällt damit in die Gruppe jener, die in Deutschland für Astra-Zeneca-Impfungen infrage kommen.

Auch Vizekanzler Olaf Scholz (SPD) hat am Freitag seine Schutzimpfung bekommen. Er habe sich das Präparat von Astra Zeneca spritzen lassen, berichtete der Finanzminister auf Twitter. Zugleich dankte er dem Ärzteteam der Bundeswehr, das ihn impfte. Scholz ist 62 Jahre alt und durfte sich daher für eine Astra-Zeneca-Impfung anmelden. Auch andere Bundesminister sind bereits geimpft. ""Jede Impfung bringt uns dem Zeitpunkt näher, an dem wir diese Pandemie überwunden haben werden"", betonte Scholz bereits vor seinem Impftermin. Alle müssten ihren Beitrag leisten und Vorbild sein.

Das Vakzin von Astra Zeneca wird in Deutschland nur noch für die über 60-Jährigen empfohlen. Der Einsatz für Jüngere bleibt nach ärztlichem Ermessen bei Menschen ohne höheres Blutgerinnsel-Risiko freiwillig möglich. Merkel hatte immer betont, dass sie geimpft werden wolle, wenn sie nach der Priorisierung an der Reihe sei.

WASHINGTON: Acknowledging that India among other countries in the region has a significant stake in Afghanistan, the Biden administration has pledged to ask regional nations to do more to support Kabul even as Washington packs up from the strife-torn country by September 11 after a failed 20-year effort to defeat the Taliban .

US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, on his way to Kabul following the announcement of the American pullout, said during a stopover at the NATO headquarters in Brussels that despite some differences there are some shared interests across a number of countries, whether it is Russia, China, India, Pakistan , Iran, Turkey, and others, in not seeing Afghanistan descend back into civil war.

""The risks that that could pose to them, including potentially extremism and terrorism directed against them, refugee flows heading in their direction, drugs as well, all of those argue that countries will have an interest and also some influence with the parties in Afghanistan to try to keep things moving in a positive direction,"" he noted, without mentioning the Pakistani military's widely known and well-chronicled role in subverting Afghanistan through its Taliban proxies for its strategic goals.

""I think countries will now have to look hard at the interests that they have, look hard at the influence they have, and decide whether to use that in ways that ensure that Afghanistan is not a source of instability and a source of terrorism and extremism,"" he added, without elaborating.

Blinken was following up on similarly vague remarks by President Biden in a nationally televised address on Wednesday in which he said Washington ""will ask other countries in the region to do more to support Afghanistan, especially Pakistan, as well as Russia, China, India, and Turkey"" since they all have a significant stake in the stable future of Afghanistan.

Biden did not mention Iran, which has a long and unstable border with Afghanistan. The basket of countries also have different interests and stakes in Afghanistan, with India alone devoting huge resources in an effort to put the country on track to be a modern and plural democracy to account for its diversity.

The upcoming US pullout without specific plans to shore up a weak government in Kabul has caused concern in New Delhi, where there is apprehension that a vacuum, in the words of Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat, could create ""space for other disruptors.""

Afghanistan is a nation which is rich in resources, and there are nations ""that tend to exploit resources for their own benefit without the benefit going to the community of that nation,"" Rawat noted at the ongoing Raisina Dialogue 2021, calling on international community to ensure ""Afghanistan is for the Afghans.""

The thinly-veiled reference to Islamabad, whose well-known depredations in Afghanistan through its Taliban proxies, is largely being ignored in Washington, which in the words of one commentator lacks the ""scrotal fortitude"" to hold Pakistani generals accountable for nurturing terrorists. In the current Washington narrative, the US will deploy less visible but potent force such as Drones to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a terrorist haven - a goal that that did not succeed even when it had boots on the ground.

Plus, it’s not like diners are helping—two minutes ago, I saw the people at the table next to me sitting there, feeding it their fries.” At press time, Simmons remarked that even though it was gross, she couldn’t help but think the coronavirus babies she spotted living in the bushes were actually kind of cute.

Premier Doug Ford announced the new restrictions during a news conference at Queen’s Park on Friday afternoon. It comes in the wake of new modelling which warns that virtually every ICU bed in the province could be occupied by a COVID-19 patient by this time next month.

“I have never shied away from telling you the brutal, honest truth, never shied away from tough decisions and today I am here to do just that. My friends we are losing the battle between variants and vaccines,” Ford said in making the announcement. “We are on our heels but if we dig in and remain steadfast we can turn this around. We are down but by no means are we out.”

As of Monday checkpoints will be set up at Ontario’s provincial borders with Quebec and Manitoba and visitors will be prohibited from entering the province except for essential purposes, such as work, medical care or the transportation of goods.

The Ford government is also shutting down non-essential construction work sites and ordering the immediate closure of all recreational amenities, including playgrounds, golf courses, tennis courts, basketball courts and soccer and baseball fields as of this weekend.

Meanwhile, the stay-at-home order will be extended for another two weeks and will now remain in effect until at least May 20.

The last stay-at-home order introduced in January was largely enforced on a complaint-only basis but Solicitor General Sylvia Jones said on Friday that police will now temporarily have the authority to stop and question people about their reason for leaving home and ask them for their address. She said that all Ontarians will also be required to carry identification and produce to any law enforcement officer that makes the request.

“I cannot stress this enough, it is imperative that everyone limit their trips outside of the home to permitted purposes only, such as going to the grocery store or pharmacy, medical appointments, outdoor exercise, or for work that cannot be done remotely,” Jones said.

Ford’s cabinet met late into the night on Thursday

The Ford government has introduced escalating restrictions on three consecutive Fridays as it has worked to curb the spread of COVID-19 and protect the healthcare system amid concerns that surging hospitalizations will soon force doctors to make difficult decisions about who to treat.

Nonetheless case counts have continued to climb with a record 4,812 new infections being reported on Friday morning.

The modelling released earlier on Friday warned that even with additional restrictions the number of patients with COVID-19 in intensive care units will likely reach 1,500 by this time next month. In the worst case scenario it could near 2,000. Ontario only has about 2,300 ICU beds available on any given day and hospitals are facing a staffing crunch as they quickly try to ramp up capacity.

“I know that the majority of Ontario residents are doing the right thing. They're following the rules and keeping each other safe. But we need to step up enforcement and we need to focus on those who are deliberately putting others at risk by ignoring the stay-at-home order,” Ford said on Friday. “Those gathering in large groups are continuing to put themselves and others at risk so understand the restrictions will be strongly, strongly enforced because they must be. We know that when they are followed these measures work.”

Ford’s cabinet met late into the night on Thursday and again on Friday morning to consider the new restrictions and the news conference to announce them ended up being pushed back twice.

Speaking with reporters, Ford said the “difficult truth” is that there were only a few options left to his government in response to the surging case counts and every one of them “comes with a massive cost to people in their lives.”

But a number of epidemiologists and public health experts are criticizing Ford for not doing enough to protect the essential workers while focusing on reducing capacity at retail stores and closing down playgrounds.

The head of critical care at Michael Garron Hospital told CP24 Friday evening that the new measures announced are disappointing.

""I think what we learned today essentially seals the fate for Ontario. We're going to be triaging patients in Ontario's ICUs. My kids aren't going to be back to school this school year, and Premier Ford is going to have to have another press conference in the near future to say that what he planned today just isn't enough,"" Dr. Michael Warner said.

He pointed that the measures do not address the root cause of the surge in cases.

""The root cause is the fact that the people in my ICU right now, who are essential workers or related to them, do not have adequate protection from the virus. The modelling was very clear. The same people are getting nailed over and over again and it says very little to protect those individuals. And it's really unfortunate.""

Warner warned that Ontario will see 1,800 patients in the ICU as he said the government is not doing what's necessary to respond to the situation.

""We're on our own here. And the bleeding is not going to stop with the band aid,"" Warner said.

Dr. Andrew Boozary, executive director of social medicine at the University Health Network, said measures that do not include paid sick leave and other supports will not protect essential workers and racialized communities disproportionately affected by the pandemic.

""We've never seen how important workers' rights are than through this pandemic, which has made it a matter of life and death instantly,"" Boozary said.

""And when you look at policies like this and you speak about the disconnect, it's really hard to see how this government, this set of policies care about communities of colour -- communities that have been on fire, and people living in poverty.""

In a statement issued on Friday afternoon, NDP Leader Andrew Horwath said that the new restrictions effectively amount to “watered-down, weak changes.”

Horwath said that rather than playing the “blame game” by focusing on increased enforcement, Ford ought to “listen to the experts” and provide paid sick days to essential workers who often have to choose between going to work with symptoms and not paying rent.

“The vast majority of people are following the rules and public health advice. But busses are packed with essential workplaces. People feeling under the weather have to go in to work because they don’t have paid sick days. Employers are continuing non-essential functions because Ford allows them to,” Horwath said.

Here is a full list of all the new restrictions:

- Outdoor gatherings will be strictly limited to members of your household only

- Capacity in big box stores will be reduced to 25 per cent

- Capacity at religious services, weddings and funerals limited to 10 people indoors

- Non-essential construction projects will be prohibited",1179,7111,46,298
0,They ‘Bombed My Dream’: Denmark Strips Some Syrians of Residency Status,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/world/europe/denmark-syrian-residence-permits.html,"Most of the 34,000 Syrians who have obtained residence permits in Denmark since the war began in their country in 2011 have not had their residency reviewed. Yet the move to strip hundreds of their legal status is the latest in a series of measures by Denmark that rights groups say have targeted migrants and minorities.

The authorities have imposed mandatory instruction in “Danish values” for children in low-income and heavily Muslim neighborhoods that the government labeled “ghettos,” and doubled punishments for certain crimes in these areas.

They have also overhauled the country’s legal apparatus on immigration, shifting it from integration to the accelerated return of refugees to their native countries. Hundreds of Somali refugees have also lost their residence permits after Denmark deemed Somalia safe to return to.

Per Mouritsen, an associate professor of political science at Aarhus University, said the government had toughened its stance on immigration in recent years to avoid losing votes to the right wing, a dilemma that several center-left parties across Europe have faced.

“The only way to beat the right-wing in Denmark is to sell your soul to the devil and be as tough on immigration in order to have support for social welfare policies in return,” Mr. Mouritsen said.

Last year, the number of refugees leaving Denmark exceeded the number of arrivals. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has vowed to go further, saying that Denmark will aim to have “zero asylum seekers.”",239,1501,11,71

Matteo Salvini, leader of Italy's right-wing League party, must stand trial on charges of kidnapping over his decision to prevent more than 100migrants from landing in the country in 2019, a judge ordered on Saturday.

Salvini, who was interior minister at that time, left the migrants stranded at sea until prosecutors ordered the seizure of the ship and the evacuation of the people on board.

The trial will begin in the Sicilian capital of Palermo on September 15.

Salvini, who has built much of his political fortune on an anti-immigration campaign, could face up to 15 years in prison if found guilty at the end of a tortuous, three-stage judicial process.

A definitive conviction could bar him from government office.

""I am going to trial with my head held high, in your name as well as mine. Italy first, always,"" Salvini tweeted immediately after the ruling. ""Defending our country is a citizen's sacred duty ... that is what I am being tried for.""

During his 14 months as interior minister, Salvini stopped several boats from docking in Italy in an effort to halt migrant flows, and regularly accused the charities that operated them of effectively encouraging people smuggling.

Proactiva Open Arms, the Spanish NGO which operated the migrant rescue ship at the heart of the case, welcomed the judge's ruling.

""Violating a fundamental right such as the protection of human beings at sea for the sake of political propaganda is shameful,"" said its founder Oscar Camps, adding that the trial would be ""an opportunity to judge a period of European history.""

Salvini withdrew the League from the coalition government in the summer of 2019 in a failed bid to trigger an election when his party was riding high in the polls.

The League, now part of Mario Draghi's two-month-old national unity government, has lost more than 10 points of voter support but remains the most popular party in Italy on about 23%, according to most opinion polls.

1,Jean Teasdale is back!,https://www.theonion.com/welfare-check-1846085921,"How glad I am that that absolute heckscape known as 2020 is finally over! Whew! I don’t care if the year made the greatest novelty New Year’s eyeglasses of my lifetime! 2020? More like two-oh-two-NO! (No offense intended to anyone who had a great 2020.)

Advertisement

Yes, your old pal Jean survived 2020! And the five years before that, too, it should go without saying. Apparently there were a few Jeanketeers who were wondering what I’ve been doing since Trump was elected, or if anyone had even checked on me. Thanks for asking, I think? Frankly, I’m a little surprised that you don’t already know from my steady string of “A Room Of Jean’s Own” columns that I’ve been alive and kicking this whole time. Am I to infer that you overlooked such modern-classic Teas-tales as “Choco-LATE For Work Again,” “Just Try To Tear Me Away From My Fidget Spinner,” “Jean Ranks The Shades Of Pink,” and “Can You Dia-Beat That?” Then again, I don’t often get The Onion sent to me in the mail—in fact, I’m having a hard time even remembering the last time I saw a print copy—so I can’t say with complete certainty that all of these columns got published. No worries! As long as the kill-fee checks arrive in the mailbox, this gal ain’t complaining!

Speaking of checks, how about that stimulus moolah? Never thought I’d see the day when the government paid us pennies on the dollar to stay home during a pandemic! Maybe some of you consider it no more than a welfare check, but I choose to see it as well-deserved partial compensation for my selfless efforts to invigorate our local economy. Not to get all political (yecch!), but think of all the glitter lip balm and scented candle buys that would have collected dust on the store shelves if not for me. I don’t impulse shop as much these days because the Walmart is over an hour away from us (RIP Shopko Hometown, which will always be Pamida in my heart!). Plus, Hubby Rick warned me if I so much as I lay an eye on the Pioneer Woman aisle, he’ll drive off without me and I’ll catch the “China virus” on the Uber trip home. (Yes, he’s still an epic grouch, and yes, sheesh-o-rama! And no, he hasn’t died—another question Jeanketeers ask too (??).)

It was pretty scary when we couldn’t pay our rent for a couple months. Eventually, even cars and trucks in a pandemic cry out for new tires, and Hubby Rick eventually went back to work at the tire center, company-mandated mask and all. (Boy, did he grumble about that!)

Jeanwhile, I was still grinding away at the Riverside Indoor Flea Market for my pal Fulgencio’s thrift-find stall ¡Basura Fabuloso! when the lockdowns began and the place closed. Of course it was horrifying, but can I also admit that I was a little relieved? Things were getting a little hot under the collar because Fulgencio was still cross at me about that big shipment of old, unsold Ben Franklin store stock that disappeared on my watch, or lack of watch, just days before. I figured, what was the harm of letting a few packed boxes sit out overnight in front of the locked stalls? The wheel of our hand truck was sticking, and I refuse to bend at the waist after 2 p.m. It’s a rule I have! Besides, every story I had heard about stuff being stolen from the flea market involved shoplifting by customers, and besides besides, who would swipe a whole case of 45-year-old pantyhose still in their original packaging, T-shirt iron-ons, and hairdo tape? Turns out, somebody! But when the flea market reopened in June, Fulgencio was so pleased and he never said anything when I showed up for work as usual. Whoo-hoo!

Everyone else working at the flea market is happy to be back, the ones who returned, that is. The milk-paint furniture stall? Gone. The booth that only sold license plates and iron doorstops? Gone. But the lady that sells fudge and that gritty Turkish delight is still around. (It would probably take, like, triple coronavirus wrapped in two tornadoes to get rid of her!) For all their relief, the vendors agree that despite the re-open, the customers seem grouchier too. It must be from all the stress we’ve been feeling. Still, nothing prepared me for this encounter with a real-life Karen lady!

I know, the smart Alecs and Alexises among you are asking, “But Jean, aren’t you a Karen lady?” Wash out your mouth with soap! (Preferably from my flea market bestie Jane’s goat’s-milk soap booth—she said if I mentioned it, she’d give me a nail brush!) Oh, I know all about the Karen ladies. But anyone who truly knows Jean Teasdale sees that I’m not an aggressive and confrontational sort. I guarantee you that if anyone ends up in defensive tears at the customer service counter, it’s me! And I always leave the manager-speaking-to to Hubby Rick. Now that I think about it, Rick doesn’t get much of anywhere either. Sure, he once got a free pizza delivered to our door by that pizzeria manager, but it also came with a punch in the eye. Not sure what Rick said to him on the phone to get that shiner, but it must have been a lulu!

Anyway, there I was, minding my (well, Fulgencio’s) business, when this lady kind of sauntered into the stall and glared at me. I said, “Hi, can I help you?” in my perkiest voice, and instead of perking back, she says, “Shouldn’t someone clean that up?”

I didn’t know what she was referring to, and when I asked what it was, and she snorted and said “You don’t know? I almost fell on my heinie [I apologize for the vulgarity—Jean]. That violates health codes.”

Advertisement

Before I could react, she added. “Someone could sue. Would you like to get sued?” I was stunned. No, I would not like to get sued! I was lucky enough to keep my job after that stolen boxes incident! Trembling a little, I craned my neck over the stall. After some scanning, I spotted a kind of pinkish-greenish smear on the floor that looked like frosting or spackle or something. When I took a closer look, I noticed that it was a big lump of Turkish delight! I guess someone disliked the taste of it and just dropped it on the floor. (That happens once in a while.)

“Clean that up,” she barked. I gulped. “I’m truly sorry about that,” I replied, flustered. “I’ll go get the custodian.” “What’s wrong with you doing it?” she demanded without a pause. “You’re right here. Take care of it yourself.”

Advertisement

I balked a little. “That stuff is not from my stall, and I’d really rather not,” I said. That’s when she asked me for a phone number to call whoever oversees the whole flea market. Yes, she wanted to speak to the manager! Well, I kind of froze. I don’t know what it is about these Karen ladies, but they’re so fearsome and commanding! I was hypnotized. Her face was all stone. For a split second, it seemed to turn into my mother’s face. (And of course all this time, several of my fellow stall operators are looking on, totally frozen, not saying a word or getting involved, including the Turkish delight lady!)

Somehow through the panic, I remembered that there was a mop and bucket in the customer bathroom a few yards away. I bolted over there, hauled out the mop and bucket and the caution sign shaped like a little kid, and started swabbing furiously at the goo. Unfortunately, the water in the bucket was already gray and dirty, and I was just making a bigger mess. I know this, because I heard the Karen lady say “You’re just making a bigger mess.” I told her I’d go get some cleaner, but I didn’t see any in the bathroom, so I just jerked some hand soap into my hand, ran back to the mess, and squeezed it onto the floor. Well, I don’t need to go into more detail. Except that I was so determined to mop that mess clean that I didn’t notice her walk away. Boy, is it hard to breathe out of a mask when you’re hyperventilating. But ends up I left her at a loss for words. Pretty unique for a Karen lady situation! As far as I know, she never spoke to the manager. I think his name is Jeff. (I will find out for the next column.)

Advertisement

Incidentally, I didn’t pick up on it until later that the Karen lady wasn’t wearing a mask . It’s flea-market policy, and I always feel sheepish asking someone to put one on. I know some people go off on how it violates their rights, but in truth, I’m the least political person in the world. Start talking about that stuff to me, and I can’t guarantee I won’t loudly chant “MmmBop,” my go-to unwanted-thought-expelling happy tune. But some hazards are hard for us essential flea-market workers to avoid!

Anyway, let’s all wish for a better 2021! Hopefully they will develop a vaccine for grouchiness, too—some people could really use it!",1556,8615,4,22

0,"Raul Castro resigns as Communist chief, ending era in Cuba",https://www.arabnews.com/node/1844256/world,"HAVANA: Raul Castro said Friday he is resigning as head of Cuba’s Communist Party, ending an era of formal leadership that began with his brother Fidel and country’s 1959 revolution.

The 89-year-old Castro made the announcement in a speech at the opening of the eighth congress of the ruling party, the only one allowed on the island.

He said he was retiring with the sense of having “fulfilled his mission and confident in the future of the fatherland.”

“Nothing, nothing, nothing is forcing me to make this decision,” said Castro, part of whose speech to the closed Congress was aired on state television. “As long as I live I will be ready with my foot in the stirrup to defend the homeland, the revolution and socialism with more force than ever.”

Castro didn’t say who he would endorse as his successor as first secretary of the Communist Party. But he previously indicated he favors yielding control to 60-year-old Miguel Díaz-Canel, who succeeded him as president in 2018 and is the standard bearer of a younger generation of loyalists who have been pushing an economic opening without touching Cuba’s one-party system.

Photographs released by the official Cuban News Agency showed Castro, dressed in an olive green uniform, entering the congress with Díaz-Canel by his side.

Castro’s retirement means that for the first time in more than six decades Cubans won’t have a Castro formally guiding their affairs, and it comes at a difficult time, with many on the island anxious about what lies ahead.

The coronavirus pandemic, painful financial reforms and restrictions imposed by the Trump administration have battered the economy, which shrank 11% last year as a result of a collapse in tourism and remittances. Long food lines and shortages have brought back echoes of the “special period” that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s.

Discontent has been fueled by the spread of the Internet and growing inequality.

Much of the debate inside Cuba is focused on the pace of reform, with many complaining that the so-called “historic generation” represented by Castro has been too slow to open the economy.

In January, Díaz-Canel finally pulled the trigger on a plan approved two congresses ago to unify the island’s dual currency system, giving rise to fears of inflation. He also threw the doors open to a broader range of private enterprise — a category long banned or tightly restricted — permitting Cubans to legally operate many sorts of self-run businesses from their homes.

This year’s congress is expected to focus on unfinished reforms to overhaul state-run enterprises, attract foreign investment and provide more legal protection to private business activities.

The Communist Party is made up of 700,000 activists and is tasked in Cuba’s constitution with directing the affairs of the nation and society.

Fidel Castro, who led the revolution that drove dictator Fulgencio Batista from power in 1959, formally became head of the party in 1965, about four years after officially embracing socialism.

He quickly absorbed the old party under his control and was the country’s unquestioned leader until falling ill in 2006 and in 2008 handing over the presidency to his younger brother Raul, who had fought alongside him during the revolution.

Raul succeeded him as head of the party in 2011. Fidel Castro died in 2016

For most of his life, Raul played second-string to his brother Fidel — first as a guerrilla commander, later as a senior figure in their socialist government. But for the past decade, it’s Raul who has been the face of communist Cuba and its defiance of US efforts to oust its socialist system.

The fourth of seven children of a Spanish immigrant in eastern Cuba, Raul had joined his charismatic older brother in a nearly suicidal attack on the Moncada military barracks in the eastern city of Santiago in 1953 and survived the crackdown that followed from the forces of dictator Fulgencio Batista.

He led a major front in the ensuing guerrilla war led by Fidel that toppled Batista. And he served for the following generation or two as head of the armed forces and eventually as Fidel’s designated successor. For many years, he was considered a more orthodox communist than his brother.

But it was Raul who reached accords with US President Barack Obama in 2014 that created the most extensive US opening to Cuba since the early 1960s — creating a surge in contacts with the United States that was largely reversed under Obama’s successor, Donald Trump.",751,4527,10,58

Table Mountain National Park (TMNP) said an initial investigation showed a vagrant's fire may have sparked the blaze.

UCT has evacuated its students and announced it was cancelling campus activity on Monday and Tuesday.

A firefighter sustained burn wounds while battling the massive fire that raged at Rhodes Memorial on Sunday, spreading down to the University of Cape Town, which was forced to evacuate approximately 4000 students.

According to the City of Cape Town's Fire and Rescue Services, the firefighter was transported to a nearby hospital for treatment.

Fire crews were expected to work throughout the night on the scene of the mountain fire behind the University of Cape Town (UCT). At present, the City has more than 150 of its firefighters on the scene from various stations across the metropole, working alongside the Table Mountain National Parks (TMNP) staff, Working on Fire and the Volunteer Wildfire Services.

According to the TMNP, an initial investigation showed the blaze might have been sparked by a vagrant.

""It should be noted that due to the extreme fire danger index for today - which is red with temperatures of 36 degrees noted and an extremely low relative humidity of under 10% - the fire spread rapidly in the direction of Rhodes Memorial.""

The veldfire has destroyed parts of the Rhodes Memorial Restaurant and Tea Garden located on the mountain's slopes. As the fire spread, the TMNP urged all hikers within the Newlands and Rhodes Memorial area to evacuate with immediate effect.

UCT evacuates students

The fire spread to the veld above the UCT upper campus, damaging buildings and forcing the university to evacuate approximately 4000 students.

All academic activity at the University of Cape Town has been suspended on Monday and Tuesday. While its still unclear the full extent of the damage, the fire has damaged the HM Pearson, Fuller and Jagger Library buildings.

UCT Vice-Chancellor Professor Mamokgethi Phakeng said, ""The safety of students and staff is paramount. For safety reasons, the campus will be locked down, and no one other than emergency services will be allowed access. We are all anxious about the extent of the damage to the Rondebosch campus. We will provide updates as soon as we are able to do so.""

She said food and emergency accommodation has been arranged for all the students who had to be evacuated on Sunday.

The Mostert Mill below UCT's upper campus also set alight during the fire and was gutted. The mill is a historic landmark that was constructed in 1796 on what was once known as Welgelegen farm. It is a Cape truncated-cone tower mill and is characterised by its thatch roof.

Caution urged

Disaster Risk Management spokesperson Charlotte Powell said at this stage, they have asked residents to be cautious.

""Close all windows and doors to prevent drafts and reduce heat. Should there be an immediate threat to your property, damp down your garden using a hose or irrigation system.""

She added Disaster Risk Management was monitoring the situation closely.

""Wildfire creates smoky conditions, so it's important for everyone to reduce exposure to smoke. Wildfire smoke irritates your eyes, nose, throat and lungs. Children, pregnant women, people living with asthma and heart disease need to be especially careful,"" Powell said.

""One of the major contributors to the rapid rate of spread was the very old pine trees and their debris. The fire created its own wind that further increased the rate of spread. The excessive amount of smoke and related updrafts made it impossible for the aerial support to slow the rate of spread,"" said Table Mountain National Park's (TMNP) fire manager Philip Prins.

Meanwhile, the Cape of Good Hope SPCA has inspectors monitoring the situation.

""It is currently unsafe to enter the area. Once it is safe, our team will search the area for injured or distressed wild animals,"" the organisation said on its Facebook page.",750,4565,6,31

As in 2016, there won’t be any litmus test based on ideology or character, so long as Mr. Pence is able to hold a prestigious position while doing little more than remaining silent and nodding from time to time. He doesn’t even care if it’s a Republican or a Democrat. He might have some trouble if it were a woman, but at the end of the day, he’s a seasoned VP ready to be unswervingly loyal to anyone who can win the White House.” At press time, Conroy stated that within 24 hours of its formation, the exploratory committee had successfully identified over 320 million Americans with more charisma than Mike Pence.

Congress has no authority to reinstate these plans, or allow Barack Obama to purchase health insurance through a PPO, EPO, POS, or other means.” At press time, dissenting Justice Sotomayor protested, adding that such a precedent could open the doors to allowing the Supreme Court to strip 39th U.S. president Jimmy Carter of his personal health insurance.

Obviously, this might just be the Sambuca talking, but Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is an energetic spin on the battle royale genre that everyone should try out.

No, we’ll go farther than that. If we were dead sober, we probably wouldn’t have the stones to say something like this. But it’s just something we feel like we need to say: Fall Guys is a more- than- welcome addition to the last man standing mechanics that sparkles with polish and an addictive gameplay loop.

Look, we know a lot of people said the popular battle royale formula was played out, and we’re obviously a little tipsy right now to boot. But what the hell, y’know? Our tongue is a little loosened by all that ’ buca and what Fall Guys does best is dress up a tried-and-true formula with vibrant visuals and just enough platformer innovation to keep you coming back for more. God, who even ordered that last round?

Gamers, this is a time when we can really just be us, and this is a safe space because we trust you, which is why we’re willing to open up and say we love the way Fall Guys exchanges the typical battle royale violence for a unique sense of cartoon whimsy. It just feels like everything is coming together for us tonight if that makes sense. It’s funny how that happens, huh?



Have you ever had Sambuca before, gamers? It’s anise liquor or something like that. It’s not really good per se, but it’s unique and kind of addicting, not unlike Fall Guys’ level design.

Hold on. We should put something in the stomach just to absorb the alcohol before we talk about the delightful rag-doll physics. It was, like, $24 for this big tapas thing, but it’s going to be worth it tomorrow morning. We didn’t have lunch, so these shots were really going to our head. You don’t mind if we keep telling you about Fall Guys while we chow down, right? Man, these polpette meatball things are so good.

Anyway, gamers, we’re pretty wasted at this point. That’s probably clear already. But these shots and Peroni keep coming our way, and we’d feel like dicks refusing. Ugh. What were we even saying? Something about there being 24 mini games in all, ranging from simple obstacle course races to heart-pounding variations like Hoopsie Daisy?

We have these dreams about you...



Oh God, what were we thinking? Sorry, we shouldn’t have said anything. We don’t know what we were talking about. It’s just all the Sambuca. We’ve had too much, gamers. We’re going to grab a cab home. We don’t even remember exactly what we said about Fall Guys. Please, just try to erase this whole thing from your memory.

1,Biden Asks White House Visitor If He Wants To Check Out Roof,https://politics.theonion.com/biden-asks-white-house-visitor-if-he-wants-to-check-out-1819572998,"WASHINGTON—Claiming it was ""pretty fucking cool up there"" and not to be missed, Vice President Joe Biden reportedly asked Estonian ambassador Väino Reinart on several occasions Sunday if he wanted to check out the White House roof.

The vice president assures Ambassador Reinart that ""there's plenty of good skin mags up there.""

""So, you ready to see this sweet-ass roof or what?"" the vice president was overheard telling Reinart, one of several foreign dignitaries who visited the White House this weekend. ""Come on, it'll be a lot of fun. It's a killer spot to just chill out. Everyone thinks this place is all about the Oval Office, but I guarantee the best seat in the house is right up top.""

Advertisement

""Real beaut of a view, too,"" Biden added as he threw an arm around the 48-year-old diplomat. ""You can see tons of shit. Be a damn shame if you didn't at least take a gander.""

Sources confirmed Biden invited Reinart to go up to the roof on at least a dozen separate occasions during his three-hour White House visit, telling the ambassador that he'd ""have a blast"" and that ""Diamond Joe"" would never steer him wrong.

Reinart told reporters the vice president repeatedly said the roof would ""totally kick ass,"" while a tour of countless bedrooms filled with boring antique furniture would ""seriously blow.""

Despite Reinart's polite assertions that he had a busy itinerary with a visiting Estonian delegation and senior White House officials, Biden insisted the two of them should ""lose the suits"" and cruise up to the roof where they could unwind with a couple of brews.

""Fuck it—let's go up,"" said Biden, who opened a Coors tallboy and handed the overflowing can to the ambassador, ignoring his gentle protests. ""I'll get the grill going, and we can just throw whatever we want on there. I got some sweet lawn chairs, a cooler, even some fireworks. I usually do my own Fourth of July thing up there.""

""Just gotta snag my tuneage,"" Biden added while retrieving a boom-box stereo and a handful of cassette tapes from a vacant office. ""I'll bring the binocs, too. Never know when a few topless chicks with balconies might be out catching some rays.""

Advertisement

As he explained that going to the top of the White House was ""the only way to truly fucking experience D.C.,"" Biden said the one rule when they got on the roof was that they definitely couldn't throw beer bottles over the side of the building anymore.

Biden, whom Secret Service officials confirmed is not permitted to be on the roof, then reportedly removed a small bag of marijuana from his pocket and explained to Reinart that he was running low but still had enough to roll a pinner joint.

Although the ambassador reminded Biden they were expected to attend a state dinner that night, the vice president assured Reinart it would be ""way cooler to get blazed"" beforehand, as doing so makes the food at official White House events taste much better.

""I've spent a lot of time on this roof,"" Biden said. ""Even slept up there once and it rained on me. By the way, if you're thirsty, don't drink anything from those Gatorade bottles.""

Advertisement

In the past, Biden has reportedly taken numerous guests up to the White House roof, including, on one occasion, Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi and German chancellor Angela Merkel, a visit Biden described as ""pretty hot and heavy.""

The vice president, who eventually convinced Reinart to journey to the roof after making numerous pleas, apologized to the ambassador for the oversight of not ""scoring some shrooms"" and arranging for a couple of local babes to accompany them on the rooftop excursion.

We’ve witnessed some amazing panels, dream-come-true announcements, and a few moments that surprised even us. Still, there’s one small detail that’s been irking us. Gamers, are you not seeing all the olives we left around the expo hall for you? There are, like, $ 500 worth here, and it’d be a huge waste if no one scooped them up and tried a few.



Advertisement

We left all of these olives out for you, guys! So really, feel free to have at ’ em!

Look, readers, we thought this would be a nice treat for everyone, so it’s just a bit of a bummer that we scattered these olives around the convention center and nobody is even picking them up to try a little nibble. Now, it’s possible no one has noticed them, but we really tried to make sure that wasn’t the case. There are olive on tables, some are on the floor, some are in baskets. Anywhere you look, there are olives.

These aren’t some cheap prepackaged olives from the grocery store, either. Maybe that’s what you’re worried about? We went to a nice cheese store and picked them up before the show. We’re talking green and black. Even a few stuffed with blue cheese. Please understand, that’s hundreds of dollars from our pockets down the drain if you don’t even take a little nibble.

Come on, gamers, why are you stepping over them like they’re trash? These are really great olives. Some of them are K alamatas straight from Greece, some have rosemary in the brine. There are even these spicy buffalo- flavored ones that are really nice, too. Even if you don’t want a ton of olives, you can be nice about it and just grab a couple.

Hell, if you really don’t like olives, all you have to do is put them on your plate, walk around with them for a little bit, and then throw them out while we aren’t looking.

Honestly, we’re a little annoyed with you right now, gamers. We sent out an email to see if anybody had dietary restrictions and no one even responded, so we were left to assume everyone was cool with olives. And now we’ve basically spent 500 dollars on nothing.

Think about it: How would that make you feel?

Now, we will take some ownership that we should have left them in jars instead of just putting them down on the conference floor and booths. But we had this image in our head that it would set up a nice tableau, and then we just ran with it. Who knows? Maybe we got overly excited about putting olives everywhere. Either way, their brine is probably an antibacterial, so it’s not like it’s going to get you sick by just picking them up and popping one in your mouth.

Listen, we’re not perfect. Not by a long shot. We’ll admit that a pitted snack might not be the best thing for a video game conference without many trash cans. But you could have at least told us you didn’t enjoy olives before the conference started. We just wanted to do something nice for you and now you’re making us feel like jerks.

This wasn’t out of some food discretionary fund, either. All of our writers pooled their own money in a little manila envelope labeled “OLIVES” because we thought it would be a great reward for our attendees. Instead, we’re going to have to pack them up in Tupperware containers at the end of the day and take them home.

0,Canadian Parliament backs Halifax Security Forum's decision to honor Taiwan's president,https://news.yahoo.com/canadian-parliament-backs-halifax-security-184813329.html,"OTTAWA — Canada’s House of Commons unanimously passed a motion Wednesday in support of the Halifax International Security Forum’s decision to honor the president of Taiwan with a prestigious award.

“President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan is a well-respected international leader, female president of Taiwan and a strong global advocate for democracy,” Conservative MP Michael Chong said as he introduced the motion, which he said was created in consultation with all political parties. “She would certainly be an ideal fit for this award.”

The symbolic, nonbinding motion also calls on the Canadian government to maintain its funding of the international defense forum at current levels, even if its flagship John McCain Prize for Leadership in Public Service is presented to President Tsai Ing-wen.

The motion comes a few days after POLITICO reported that Canadian officials told HFX organizers that the government would pull its support from the event if the John McCain Prize went to Tsai. Canada is a top sponsor of the forum.

Canadian Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan has since denied that the Trudeau government threatened to withhold funding over the organizers’ plan for the award.

Sajjan, however, declined to answer Monday when pressed by Conservative lawmakers to say if he would endorse Tsai for such a prize. The minister told a committee hearing that HFX is independent and was free to make its own decisions when it comes to awards.

He was also asked whether he would commit to continuing to fund the forum regardless of whom the HFX chose to receive its prizes. Sajjan said he would take a look at the funding request as he does every year.

For several days, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government has also faced questions about the story in the House of Commons.

Earlier Wednesday, Trudeau was pressed by Chong during question period to commit to maintaining HFX funding, even if organizers awarded the John McCain Prize to Tsai.

Trudeau replied, “the government has supported and provided funding to the Halifax Security Forum throughout our time in office, and the minister has participated every year and will continue to.”

Story continues

The prime minister continued by saying that he has always supported Taiwan's “meaningful participation in multilateral international forums.”

“Canada continues to have strong and growing trade and people-to-people relations with Taiwan,” he said.

Trudeau ignored the preamble to Chong’s question in which he referenced details from POLITICO’s story. “The government’s attempt to silence those critical of China is shameful and it plays right into China's desire to silence its critics abroad,” Chong said.

Ottawa has avoided provoking Beijing after bilateral relations plunged over two years ago. In December 2018, Canadian authorities arrested Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on behalf of the U.S.

Beijing, angered by her arrest, has demanded her release. Meng, accused of breaking U.S. international sanctions against Iran, has denied any wrongdoing and is fighting extradition.

In an apparent retaliation, China arrested two Canadians — Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor — just days later and has since charged them with spying.

Multiple sources familiar with the matter told POLITICO that HFX organizers decided to give the 2020 award to Tsai. Cindy McCain, a member of the forum’s board of directors, approved the decision to honor Tsai with the prize named after her late husband.

When Canadian officials learned of the plans, they made it clear if organizers gave the award to Tsai, the Canadian government would yank its support — and funding — from HFX.

During Monday's committee hearing, a testy exchange suggested that Sajjan has concerns about the organization behind the forum.

The back-and-forth started when Conservative MP John Williamson asked Sajjan what he thought about HFX.

“I want to make sure you’re talking about the Halifax International Security Forum, not their office that they have in Washington. Is that correct?” Sajjan asked before getting an affirmative answer from Williamson. “Good, so just the event itself, not the office and not the employees that are former Conservative staffers that actually work in that office? Is that correct?”",669,4254,11,87

Its provisions dictate that the president can sidestep any checks and balances on his power once he has abused his authority so many times that no one can keep track anymore.” Trump added that while his opponents may try to challenge his executive order in court, the loophole also states that by then he will have achieved his immediate political aims.",204,1267,18,117

More than 16,000 civilian contractors, including over 6,000 Americans, now provide security, logistics and other support in Afghanistan, according to recent figures compiled by the Pentagon. Top military officials on Wednesday played down any significant role for civilian contractors in combating Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, although some analysts say they could be used to train Afghan security forces.

Under Mr. Biden’s order, the United States is withdrawing 2,500 troops from Afghanistan, but the Pentagon actually has about 1,000 more troops on the ground there than it has publicly acknowledged. The murky accounting results from some Special Operations forces having been put “off the books,” Pentagon officials say, to include some elite Army Rangers, who work under both the Pentagon and the C.I.A. while deployed to Afghanistan.

The Obama administration used similar sleights of hand under the bureaucratic term “force management levels,” which resulted in more troops in war zones with little public oversight.

But Pentagon officials said they would not resort to those tactics to slip undisclosed troops into Afghanistan after the departure deadline, even though some analysts voiced skepticism.

“We are actively engaged in counterterrorism where every effort is made to minimize the ‘troops’ — the boots on the ground — and replace them with an invisible force that can achieve just as much,” William M.

The agreement includes a $1.65 billion contract for the establishment and operation of a training centre for the Hellenic Air Force by Israeli defence contractor Elbit Systems over a 22-year period, Israel’s defence ministry said.

The training centre will be modelled on Israel’s own flight academy and will be equipped with 10 M-346 training aircraft produced by Italy’s Leonardo, the ministry said.

Elbit will supply kits to upgrade and operate Greece’s T-6 aircraft and also provide training, simulators and logistical support.

“I am certain that (this programme) will upgrade the capabilities and strengthen the economies of Israel and Greece and thus the partnership between our two countries will deepen on the defence, economic and political levels,” said Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz.

The announcement follows a meeting in Cyprus on Friday between the UAE, Greek, Cypriot and Israeli foreign ministers, who agreed to deepen cooperation.

The Israeli and Greek air forces on Sunday launched a joint exercise in Greece, the Israeli military said.

In at least one past exercise over Greece, Israeli fighter planes practised against an S-300 posted on Crete. The Russian-made air defence system is also deployed in Syria and Iran, Israel’s foes.

A source in the Hellenic National Defence Command said the S-300 had not been activated in the joint exercise that began Sunday.",291,1864,9,56

0,Microplastics Are Now Spiralling Around The Globe in The Air We Breathe,https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-are-now-spiralling-around-the-globe-in-the-air-we-breathe,"Our plastic pollution problem has become so bad that microplastics are now embedded in the regular cycles of the atmosphere, circulating around the planet like oxygen or water, according to a new study.

Plastic particles sent up into the air from ocean spray and road surfaces travel across continents and reaching the most remote spots on Earth, according to a mix of sampling and modeling done by researchers.

Much of this plastic appears to have been circulating through our ecosystems for a long time – highlighting just how much of a massive clean up operation we've got on our hands if we're to reverse the plastic tide.

""We found a lot of legacy plastic pollution everywhere we looked,"" says geological scientist Janice Brahney from Utah State University. ""It travels in the atmosphere and it deposits all over the world.""

""This plastic is not new from this year. It's from what we've already dumped into the environment over several decades.""

Between December 2017 and January 2019, researchers collected 313 samples of airborne microplastics from 11 different sites across the western US. They found that 84 percent of the plastic particles came from road dust, 11 percent originated from sea spray, 5 percent came from agricultural soil, and 0.4 percent was put down to population sources.

In other words, this is mainly plastic that has been ground down on roads or whipped up from garbage patches in the ocean. Microplastic pollution isn't just concentrated around urban areas – it's getting everywhere, carried on the wind.

The findings were then plugged into a computer model to try and figure out what the worldwide pattern of atmospheric plastics might look like. Time spent in the air for the particles could range from an hour to almost a week, the team deduced – long enough for the plastic to travel the continents.

While the remote wilderness of Antarctica isn't exporting any airborne microplastics, it's very likely to be importing them, the model showed – and it's a similar story across the planet. Microplastics are accumulating just about everywhere scientists look, including national parks, with the highest concentrations estimated to be over the oceans.

""Using our best estimate of plastic sources and modeled transport pathways, most continents are net importers of microplastics from the marine environment,"" says Natalie Mahowald from Cornell University. ""This underscores the cumulative role of legacy pollution in the atmospheric burden of plastic.""

While the modeling part of the study uses some guesses and estimations to map out airborne microplastics on a global scale, there's little doubt that these polluting particles are very much blowing in the wind.

To date, nearly 10 billion metric tons of plastic have been produced globally since the early 1900s, and it's estimated that between 12-18 percent of it isn't accounted for by landfills, recycling, or incinerating.

The team behind this latest study is calling for more research into where all of this plastic ends up and how it might be distributed worldwide – affecting ecosystems, wildlife, the food chain, and ultimately our health.

""We did the modeling to find out the sources, not knowing what the sources might be,"" says Mahowald. ""It's amazing that this much plastic is in the atmosphere at that level, and unfortunately accumulating in the oceans and on land and just recirculating and moving everywhere, including remote places.""

The research has been published in PNAS.",562,3490,12,71
0,"In its latest lurch to the far right, Denmark plans to send refugees back to Syria",https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/18/europe/denmark-syrian-refugees-damascus-intl/index.html,"They did not speak a word of Danish yet the Scandinavian country was an outpost of calm for the siblings, who fled the destruction and death that followed the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011.

""I can hardly remember anything but war in Syria,"" Dania, 22, told CNN of her time growing up on the outskirts of the country's capital, Damascus. She said what drew her family of five to Denmark was its reputation for welcoming refugees -- being the first country in the world to sign the United Nations Refugee Convention in 1951.

On arriving in 2015, it only took them a year to learn the language, and now Dania is months away from finishing high school in the Danish port of Kolding. ""We were very happy at the beginning and felt safe being here,"" Dania, who hopes to work in bio-medicine, said. ""We [wanted] a good future, therefore we did everything [we could] to learn Danish.""

The siblings asked CNN to withhold their last name due to concerns for family members back in Syria.

Hussam, 20, described Denmark as a place of peace, a country where his family felt at home, and ""a society that gives you the freedom to live the way you want."" He hoped to study engineering or medicine once he completed high school next year.

Those dreams were dashed when Denmark became the first democratic European nation to tell Syrian refugees originating from Damascus and its surrounding countryside to return to the war-torn nation.

In 2019, the Danish government began reviewing the residency permits of refugees who came from Damascus -- a move based on its assessment that the conditions there had improved and it was therefore safe for refugees to return. In February, it was announced they were also reviewing the status of several hundred Syrian refugees from Damascus' surrounding region.

But critics say the policy of stripping Syrians of residency permits is the latest salvo aimed at Denmark's non-White refugee and immigrant community. While fighting has subsided considerably in the region around Damascus, activists say the Danish government is actively putting Syrians in harm's way.

""We disagree with the decision to deem the Damascus area, or any other area [in Syria], safe for refugees,"" Charlotte Slente, the secretary general of the Danish Refugee Council, told CNN.

""We have knowledge from various reports of arbitrary detention and ongoing civil rights abuses of the civilian population in Syria,"" she added, citing a March Human Rights Council report , which found that the Syrian government's policy and acts ""amount to crimes against humanity [and] have continued unabated for nearly 10 years, without any sign that the government intends to discontinue them.""

The Danish minister for immigration and integration, Mattias Tesfaye, defended the policy in a statement to CNN, saying that ""Denmark has been open and honest from day one"" that residence permits for Syrian refugees are ""temporary, and that the permit can be revoked if the need for protection ceases to exist.""

""The approach of the Danish government is to provide protection to those in need of it, but when the conditions in their home country have improved, former refugees should return to the home country and reestablish their life there,"" Tesfaye added.

Dania and Hussam's family have been caught in the dragnet. The Danish Immigration Service uprooted their lives in February by refusing to extend their father's residency permit, which their own visas are linked to, according to their lawyer Daniel Nørrung. Dania and Hussam had been told to leave Denmark by March 5, but with the help of a lawyer, the family is challenging the decision with the Refugee Appeals Board.

""It's a bit problematic, Dania and Hussam were given a date to leave Denmark when their father's case has not even been finalized,"" Nørrung told CNN.

If the appeals board upholds the immigration service's decision, the family will be stripped of their rights to study, work or live in the country. This mean they risk being sent to one of two deportation facilities -- known as ""departure centers"" -- for people who have been refused asylum and refugees like them who have lost their status.

""We are going to languish in a center, where people are broken down, humiliated and held in helplessness and hopelessness, instead of being able to go out and contribute to society,"" Dania said.

A small group of people in Copenhagen Central Station wait to welcome Syrian refugees on September in 2015.

Uprooting lives

The Danish government has refused to extend the residency permits of least 300 Syrian refugees since 2019, after its security assessment concluded that the situation in Damascus was ""no longer so serious.""

Authorities are currently reexamining the protection of more than 400 more Syrian refugees living in the country, according to figures given to CNN by the Ministry of Immigration and Integration.

This is part of a self-described paradigm shift of Danish refugee policy, said Nikolas Feith Tan, a refugee law expert at the Danish Institute of Human Rights.

The move has seen successive governments enact legislative amendments that have shifted the country's focus from the integration and permanent protection of refugees to the kind of temporary residency permits Dania and Hussam were placed under.

In January, the country's left-wing Social Democrat Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen reiterated her party's intention to be as restrictive on immigration as her right-wing predecessors, telling parliament the goal was to have ""zero asylum seekers."" Frederiksen adopted a hardline stance on immigration in the run-up to Denmark's 2019 election, luring voters away from the right-wing populist Danish People's Party (DPP).

After winning the election, the Social Democrat party is ""locked in now"" to prove it is not soft on immigration, or it risks drawing the ire of right-wing parties or the electorate, Kristina Bakkær Simonsen, an associate professor at Aarhus University, who specializes in immigrant integration, discrimination and stigmatization, told CNN.

While the Danish government ""cannot carry out forced returns"" as it does not have diplomatic relations with Syria, ""the government's clear hope is that this group of people will choose to return voluntarily, which some Syrians already have done,"" Tan added.

To help with the move ""a bag of money from the Danish state"" is provided to the voluntary Syrian returnees, the immigration and integration minister Tesfaye has said . His ministry told CNN the financial support is around $28,150, and since 2019 more than 250 Syrian refugees have taken the financial support package.

But activists say Syrians are being compelled to return by the Danish government's efforts to make life intolerable for those without residency rights. The deportation centers Dania and Hussam dread entering ""are like torture, designed to break people down,"" Michala Clante Bendixen, the head of Refugees Welcome Denmark, told CNN.

The centers are partially open, which means their occupants are able to move in and out freely, said Bendixen. But the occupants have to check in every evening, and have no income, rights to employment or access to public housing. One center is around four miles from the nearest bus stop, making it impossible for anyone to leave in the day.

""There are no activities, no training courses, you can't even cook your own food,"" Bendixen said, noting that even in prison there are opportunities to make money. Instead of returning to their country of origin, refugees sometimes ""go underground"" and flee to other European countries ""where they will try and reopen their asylum cases,"" Bendixen said.

Targeting immigrants and refugees

In 2018, Denmark's government struck a deal to move ""unwanted"" migrants to a remote uninhabited island once used for contagious animals. The plan was later scrapped.

In recent years, Denmark has rolled out some of the harshest anti-immigrant policies in Europe, including a so-called jewelry bill that allows the government to take certain assets from asylum seekers to contribute to the country's welfare state.

In 2017, the former Liberal Party immigration minister Inger Stojberg celebrated the passage of another law that tightened immigration controls with cake. The following year, a decade-old proposal by the right-wing populist DPP to ban face coverings in public came into force, essentially criminalizing Muslim women who wear the niqab or burqa.

In 2019, the government forced social and ethnic change in 15 low-income housing estates across the country -- which it called ""hard ghettos"" and which Danish regulations define partly according to the races of residents.

This year, the authorities said it would drop the term ""ghetto"" but expand the law to prevent the growth of such enclaves. The aim is that by the end of the decade, ""residents with non-Western backgrounds"" can only comprise up to 30% of any neighborhood in Denmark, according to a press release from the Interior and Housing Ministry.

""For far too many years, we have closed our eyes to the development that was underway, and only acted when the integration problems became too great,"" housing minister Kaare Dybvad Bek said in a statement. ""We will do this by preventing more vulnerable housing areas and by creating more mixed housing areas throughout Denmark.""

But the government is not succeeding in escaping the scrutiny that ""they are trying to avoid by renaming ghetto areas, when they keep prioritizing ethnicity as the prime criterion"" of these policies, Simonsen told CNN.

'Copying the far right'

Critics say the governing coalition, which is led by the Social Democrats, is copying the language of the Danish far right.

""Denmark is strong when it comes to rights and solidarity; burden sharing and economic equality; fair governance and no corruption,"" Bendixen said. ""In that way, it is very surprising and very paradoxical we have this growing xenophobia and also managed to make ... clearly discriminatory laws"" for refugees and immigrants, she said.

Some maintain that, at its core, Denmark's identity is tied to its White heritage -- something reflected in official statistics, which divides the population into three categories: ""persons of Danish origins,"" ""immigrants,"" and ""descendants of immigrants."" This means that second-generation immigrants, who are naturalized Danish citizens, are not counted officially in the Danish category.

In 2019, new legislation compelled housing associations to sell or redevelop 40% of public housing stock in low-rent, ethnic minority enclaves.

Last year, the immigration and integration minister Tesfaye announced a new classification for people from primarily Muslim countries. The category, called MENAPT, will include people from or with heritage from Middle Eastern and North African countries as well as Pakistan and Afghanistan.

""It will provide a clearer picture of how people from 24 countries, primarily in the Middle East and North Africa, who have played a major role in immigration to Denmark, cope in relation to, for example, crime and employment,"" a government statement wrote.

What it shows, Bendixen said, is that there appears to be ""two sets of laws"" in Denmark: ""One set for 'the real Danes,' and one set for the 'others who don't belong here.'""

While analysts have noted that Danish political discourse on immigrants is extremely negative compared to other European countries, the policy of removing the refugee status of Syrians has been controversial in the country.

The plight of young Danish-speaking Syrians have filled the pages of the country's largest broadsheets and Facebook groups have been set up to campaign for them to remain.

The action has also made the country an outlier among its closest allies. In March, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the UN Security Council that it was ""not in the interest of the Syrian people to pressure Syrian refugees to return to Syria, including to regime-held areas, where many fear they will be arbitrary detained, tortured, or even killed by Assad's security forces in retaliation for fleeing.""

""We agree with the UN that refugee returns must be voluntary, well-informed, and should ensure the safety and dignity of the people involved -- or else they should not happen,"" Blinken added.

But Denmark does not appear to be reconsidering the move. ""The government's policy is working, and I won't back down, it won't happen,"" immigration minister Tesfaye told Agence France Presse. In a statement to CNN he pointed to reports by the UK Home Office , the European Union's Asylum Office and the Swedish government that said the security situation in Damascus had improved.

However, neither of those nations are repatriating Syrians to the Damascus region, while the EU does not recommend doing so.

All Hussam and Dania want to do is remain in Denmark. But instead of worrying about exams and other everyday concerns like their Danish friends, the siblings now fear their family may face repercussions on returning to Syria for ""turning our backs"" against the regime. Hussam also stands the risk of being conscripted into the Syrian army, he said.

""Syria is not safe, and will not be safe no matter what city it is, as long as a dictator rules it,"" he said.",2145,13301,16,82

China is using five different vaccines in order to vaccinate its population and has just gotten to the point where millions of people are being vaccinated per day.

0,US cancels warships deployment to Black Sea: Turkish officials,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/15/us-cancels-warships-deployment-to-black-sea-turkish-officials,"Turkey said last week the US will send two warships to the Black Sea, a decision Russia called unfriendly provocation.

The United States has cancelled the deployment of two warships to the Black Sea, Turkish foreign ministry officials said, amid concerns over a Russian military build-up on Ukraine’s borders.

Last week, Turkey said Washington would send two warships to the Black Sea, in a decision Russia called an unfriendly provocation.

Washington and NATO have been alarmed by the build-up near Ukraine and in Crimea, the peninsula that Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.

The US embassy in Ankara had notified Turkey’s foreign ministry of the cancellation, officials said on Wednesday but did not provide a reason.

Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency later reported that no new notices had been conveyed to Ankara for potential deployments at later dates.

US officials said Turkey may have misunderstood the initial notification and that the deployment was never confirmed.

They said the US frequently notifies Turkey of potential access to the Black Sea, adding that a request does not necessarily mean its ships will pass through, but rather ensures that if they choose to, they already have the required approval.

Moscow’s warning

Russia, which has warned Washington to stay far away from Crimea and its Black Sea coast, says the build-up is a three-week snap military drill to test combat readiness in response to what it calls threatening behaviour from NATO.

It said the exercise is due to wrap up within two weeks.

Ahead of the notification about US warships, Russia’s navy on Wednesday began a drill in the Black Sea that rehearsed firing at surface and air targets.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called on Moscow on Tuesday to end its troop build-up.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has called for the “worrying” developments in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region to come to an end.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Joe Biden called on Russia to pull back troops from Ukraine’s borders.

Judge Lorenzo Iannelli set September 15 as the trial date during a hearing in the Palermo bunker courtroom, the LaPresse news agency reported.

Mr Salvini, who attended the hearing, confirmed the outcome and insisted he was only doing his job and his duty by refusing entry to the Open Arms rescue ship and the 147 people it had rescued in the Mediterranean.

Citing the Italian constitution, Mr Salvini tweeted that defending the country was the “sacred duty” of every Italian.

Palermo prosecutors have accused Mr Salvini of dereliction of duty and kidnapping, for having kept the migrants at sea off the coast of Lampedusa for days in August 2019.

During the standoff, some of the migrants threw themselves overboard in desperation as the captain pleaded for a safe, close port.

Eventually after a 19-day ordeal, the remaining 83 migrants still on board were allowed to disembark in Lampedusa.

Mr Salvini had maintained a hard line on migration as interior minister during the first government of premier Giuseppe Conte, from 2018-2019.

While demanding European Union nations do more to take in migrants arriving in Italy, Mr Salvini argued that humanitarian rescue ships were only encouraging Libya-based traffickers and that his policy actually saved lives by discouraging the risky trips across the Mediterranean.

His lawyer, Giulia Bongiorno, said she was certain the court would eventually determine that there was no kidnapping involved.

Open Arms, for its part, hailed the decision to put Mr Salvini on trial.

“We are happy for all the people we have rescued … in all these years,” the group tweeted.

The group’s founder, Oscar Camps, said the decision to prosecute was “historic”, showing that European political leaders can be held accountable for failing to respect the human rights of migrants.

“This trial is a reminder to Europe and the world that there are principles of individual responsibility in politics,” Mr Camps told a press conference Saturday.

The decision to prosecute shows “it’s possible to identify the responsibility of the protagonists of this tragedy at sea”.

Mr Salvini is also under investigation for another, similar migrant standoff involving the Italian coastguard ship Gregoretti that he refused to let dock in the summer of 2019.

The prosecutor in that case, Andrea Bonomo, recommended last week that Mr Salvini not be put on trial, arguing that he was carrying out government policy when he kept the 116 migrants at sea for five days.",441,2707,13,82

The meeting would lay the groundwork for a meeting in the so-called ""Normandy"" format, he said, though he gave no indication whether or when such a meeting could happen.

The ""Normandy"" format talks involve the leaders of France, Germany, Ukraine and Russia and have not taken place since December 2019.

""...This is an important preparatory meeting for the Normandy format,"" Zelenskiy said, adding that ""the situation in Donbass is now under control.""

Ukraine and Russia have traded blame over a spike in violence in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian troops have battled Russian-backed forces in a conflict that Kyiv says has killed 14,000 people since 2014.

Ukraine and its Western allies have accused Russia of a ""provocative"" build-up of troops near Ukraine's eastern border and annexed Crimea.

Zelenskiy also thanked Turkey for its support and said Ukrainian tourists should visit Turkey after Russia restricted travel there.

A court in Paris on Thursday handed down life sentences to two Ivorian officers and a Belarussian mercenary who were tried in absentia for the deadly 2004 bombing of French peacekeepers in Ivory Coast that triggered days of fierce clashes.

Advertising Read more

Ivorians Patrice Ouei and Ange Gnanduillet and Belarus national Yury Sushkin were found guilty of carrying out the raid near the Ivorian city of Bouaké on November 6, 2004, in which nine French soldiers and a US aid worker were killed.

The Bouaké bombing targeted a peacekeeping force deployed in a buffer zone between the government-controlled south of Ivory Coast and the rebel-held north.

It prompted a French retaliatory strike that wiped out Ivory Coast’s small air force, in turn triggering days of fierce clashes that saw French helicopters pluck people to safety as angry mobs hunted foreigners through the streets of Abdijan and other cities.

Thursday's verdict caps a protracted legal battle that has fuelled suspicions of a cover-up. The three men were tried in absentia having controversially evaded capture in the days following the raid.

Laurent Gbagbo, the then-Ivorian president whose relations with the former colonial power had already plummeted at the time, has always denied ordering the Bouaké airstrikes.

The case was brought by some 40 plaintiffs, including victims of the slain peacekeepers and some of the dozens of soldiers who were injured in the air strikes – the deadliest attack on French forces since the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing.

The plaintiffs were hoping the three weeks of hearings would help shed light on the many unanswered questions raised by a case that carries shades of France’s often murky dealings in its former African colonies.

How suspects got away

Shortly after the Bouaké airstrikes, the three suspects were identified in pictures taken by French intelligence at an airport near the capital, Yamoussoukro, standing next to the Sukhoi-25 planes used in the attack.

Ten days later, Yury Sushkin and seven other Belarussians were detained by Togolese authorities after travelling from Ivory Coast. Togo offered to turn them over to French authorities, who, in a twist that has puzzled investigators, suggested they be released instead.

It was the second time France had potentially allowed at least one of the suspects to slip away.

The day after the Bouaké airstrikes, French troops in Abidjan detained 15 mercenaries from Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, only to release them four days later.

According to investigators, French diplomats, soldiers and intelligence had been instructed “not to get involved” in the matter. Officials quizzed over the years have repeatedly argued that the priority then was to rescue French nationals living in Ivory Coast at the time.

Ministers quizzed

Failure to apprehend the suspects has prompted scrutiny of the role of three senior cabinet ministers at the time: Michèle Alliot-Marie, then the defence minister, Dominique de Villepin, the former interior minister, and Michel Barnier, who held the foreign affairs portfolio.

Attempts to prosecute the three former ministers collapsed in 2019 when the Cour de justice de la République, the only court with the power to try ministers, chose not to take up the case.

Instead, the trio appeared as witnesses in the Paris trial, though they were unable to explain how the three suspects got away.

Senior French officials have long backed the hypothesis of an Ivorian military “blunder” orchestrated by Gbagbo’s government. Its aim, they argue, was either to turn the attention away from a failing campaign against northern rebels or to sever the country’s remaining ties with its former colonial power.

Among the plaintiffs, however, widespread frustration at the many roadblocks hit by investigators over the years has only heightened suspicions of a potential cover-up.

Along with Gbagbo’s entourage, some relatives of the victims suspect their loved ones were caught up in a botched operation aimed at discrediting the Ivorian president and justifying a French riposte.

Gbagbo was eventually forced from power in 2011, with the help of French peacekeeping forces, following a disputed presidential election won by his longtime rival, Alassane Ouattara.

“We cannot allow a foreign power to interfere in our democratic process with impunity,” Biden said in remarks delivered in the East Room of the White House.

On Thursday morning, the president signed an executive order that imposed a range of new sanctions and the expulsion of diplomats. The sanctions allow the U.S. government to block bond transactions between U.S. institutions and Russian banks; the order reserves the right for the U.S. to expand these sovereign debt sanctions.

In his remarks from the White House, Biden said he had warned Putin repeatedly in the past several months that there would be consequences for Russia’s meddling in U.S. elections, the SolarWinds data breach of U.S. government computers and its continued aggression in Crimea.

In a call with Putin on Wednesday, Biden said, he informed the Russian president of the new sanctions but also stressed that he had sought to deliver a “proportionate” response to them.

“I was clear with President Putin that we could have gone further. But I chose not to do so. I chose to be proportionate,” Biden said. “The United States is not looking to kick off a cycle of escalation and conflict with Russia. We want a stable, predictable relationship.”

Biden added that further retaliatory action against Russia was not off the table.

“If Russia continues to interfere with our democracy, I’m prepared to take further actions to respond,” he said.

As part of the Biden administration’s retaliatory actions, the Treasury Department unveiled sanctions against 32 entities and individuals on Thursday. The White House, meanwhile, expelled 10 Russian diplomats from Washington.

In a show of support for the new sanctions, foreign ministers from the other G-7 nations — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the U.K. — joined the U.S. in a statement issued Thursday.

""We call on Russia to cease its provocations and to immediately de-escalate tensions in line with its international obligations,"" the statement said.

While Biden said he was firm with Putin during Wednesday’s call, he also stressed that the two leaders should continue to speak one on one and proposed that they hold a summit in the coming months.

“I expressed my belief that communication between the two of us, personally and directly, was to be essential in moving forward to a more effective relationship, and he agreed on that point,” Biden said. “To that end, I proposed that we meet in person this summer in Europe for a summit to address a range of issues facing both of our countries.”

Kremlin and White House readouts of Wednesday’s phone call between the two men make no mention of conversations about jailed Putin opposition leader Alexei Navalny.

Asked about the omission Wednesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that “the health, the safety of Alexei Navalny is raised frequently and through many channels.”

In a March interview with ABC News, Biden was asked whether he thought Putin was a “killer.”

“I do,” he replied, a response that drew a sharp rebuke from Russia, which also promptly recalled its ambassador to Washington.

On Thursday, Biden’s tone was far less critical, as he repeatedly highlighted the potential in an ongoing partnership with Russia.

“The way forward is through thoughtful dialogue and the diplomatic process,” he said.

As yet, there has been no formal response from the Kremlin regarding Biden’s proposal for a summit.

Biden seemed optimistic about the prospect for good relations between the U.S. and Russia, but made sure to underscore that he will not be bullied or allow himself to be taken advantage of by Putin.

“My bottom line is this: When there is interest to work with Russia, we should and we will,” Biden said. “And when Russia seeks to violate the interests of the United States, we will respond.”

Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada: China’s Orwellian “social credit system” that records the social and financial behaviour of individuals and corporations across China, using a vast surveillance system, has expanded globally, and is now openly operational at the renowned Haidilao hot pot restaurant, in Western Canada.

Ryan Pan, a manager with Haidilao Hot Pot in Vancouver confirmed that over 60 surveillance cameras have been installed in the restaurant at the request of the Haidilao corporation, as part of the social credit system in China. He said that the Vancouver location has 30 tables with two cameras assigned to each table.

When asked specifically why Haidilao required so many cameras to monitor staff and patrons, Ryan Pan said that the cameras were installed to “punish” staff if they didn’t adhere to corporate standards and to “people track”. Pan also said that the video is sent back to China but declined to say why this was, other than to say the reason for this was “secret.”

Founded in Sichuan, China, the Haidilao opened up at two locations in the Vancouver region, the most recent of which was opened in 2018 in a former Swiss Chalet restaurant in the trendy Kitsilano district of Vancouver. The location is within walking distance of the home rented by Huawei for staff temporarily re-located to Vancouver to assist Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer (CFO) of the telecom giant. Following her arrest and hearing over a provisional US extradition request for fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud in order to circumvent US sanctions against Iran. The Haidilao location is no more than 10 minutes to Meng Wanzhou’s mansion and the Peoples Republic of China Consulate. Haidilao has over 935 locations around the world and more than 36 million VIP members and 60,000 plus staff.

We reached out to Ivy Li, with the Canadian Friends of Hong Kong, who is a well-known public speaker, writer and activist on matters related to China and pro-democracy, to ask why Canadians should be concerned that China’s social credit system is now operational in Canada.

Ivy, who was born and raised in Hong Kong, had this to say in response: “Not only ethnic Chinese Canadians and residents, and businesses with Chinese ties are put at risk, but the privacy and safety of all Canadians and our society are compromised. Customers at a popular ethnic cuisine restaurant, especially in an upscale area, could be diplomats and politicians entertaining their guests, CEOs discussing their business strategies, professionals talking about company projects, journalists conducting interviews, etc., etc. Dinners discuss a wide range of subjects, especially after a couple of wine. The dining table in a popular restaurant is one of the best places to eavesdrop on someone and to get the pulse of a society.”

CHINA’S SOCIAL CREDIT SYSTEM

China’s social credit system was officially rolled out nationwide in 2014 with a plan to build “trust” in the marketplace and broader society. According to a report by USA Congressional Research Service (CRS) in 2020, China’s social credit system has developed into two connected but distinct systems: a system for monitoring individual behaviour, still in early pilot stages, and a more robust system for monitoring corporate behaviour.

The deadline for implementing China’s social credit system was 2020 when it became mandatory for all Chinese citizens to be enrolled in the national database and rated with a “social score” based on different behaviours; these “social scores” are then used to punish or reward. Praise the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on social media and you will be given a higher score, potentially leading to benefits such as priority for school admissions, free gym services, shorter wait times at hospitals and other benefits. Illegally protest against the CCP, forget to pay your utility bill, or knowingly associate with another individual who has a low score, and you might be restricted in accessing public services, excluded from taking transportation, or perhaps your children will be denied entry into the best schools.

A similar model is applied to businesses in China called the Corporate Social Credit System (CSCS) designed to create a single, standardized reputation system for local and foreign firms alike. The system touches on virtually all aspects of a company’s business operations in China by assessing company performance, making sure they pay their taxes, uphold standard of service and other market entities. Based on their rating, Chinese authorities will reward or punish businesses that can result in penalty fees, higher inspection rates and possibly even blacklisting. Companies receiving a high corporate social credit score could result in better tax rate, market access and possibly being placed on what is known as a “redlist”.

That is inside China. What isn’t clear is how China’s social credit system impacts overseas Chinese living in Canada who work for companies with ties to China who are required to be a part of CSCS. Will the behaviours and actions taken by individuals working in Canada for Chinese companies impact the score of relatives or other employees inside China? It’s not inconceivable that a person protesting in Canada about human rights abuses in China, may not be hired by a Chinese owned company because they have been blacklisted by China’s social credit system, even if they live in Canada. What about the impact of China’s social credit system on Canadian employment laws, privacy, and human rights laws?

We know that China has already started to move forward with the creation of an English language corporate social credit system version by Xinhua Credit for non-Chinese firms.

International brands are already punished if they step out of line in and out of China. They must either stay silent or actively support China’s policies if they want future access to the Chinese market. We saw the NBA’s Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted in support of the Hong Kong protests and ultimately was forced to apologize. More recently, the boycott of H&M and other Western brands in China after they spoke out against forced labour in the cotton industry in the Xinjiang region of China. There is already a punishment-based system for corporations that don’t comply with the CCP regime regardless of compliance with China’s CSCS.

HAVE ANY CANADIAN LAWS BEEN BROKEN?

China’s CSCS operating within Canadian borders all boils down to the safety of workers, human rights, privacy of citizenry and national security, all of which is governed by legislation at a municipal, provincial, and federal level. The Canadian government is aware that China has implemented the CSCS and has even issued recommendations on how to conduct business inside China now that it has been implemented. But little to nothing has been done by elected officials to prevent China from implementing the CSCS inside Canada as a way to control foreign workers from China and Chinese owned businesses, or anyone for that matter, who is ethnic Chinese with personal or professional ties to China.

At a municipal (city) level, until recently, commercial security cameras used to be powered from a plug in the wall with a video cable going back to a personal video recorder (PVR). The City of Vancouver would normally require an electrical permit for this kind of set-up which would have, at the very least, alerted city officials in this case, given the large volume of cameras installed. However, the Haidilao cameras appear to be more modern cameras powered over Ethernet (POE). Meaning they are plugged into a network that can send video footage live back to China. They can be installed at any point without a permit. Quite simply, there is nothing stopping the Chinese government from insisting that all businesses in Canada who have ties to China either professionally or personally install a surveillance system as part of China’s social credit system.

British Columbia purports to have strict privacy laws with the Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) governing how an organization can collect, use, or disclose information on individuals. When asked if the Office of the Privacy Commissioner was aware of CSCS sending private footage of temporary foreign workers and Canadian citizens back to China, Michelle Mitchell with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner in BC (unrelated to author), stressed that an important component of PIPA is consent and that an organization must have consent before collecting, using, or disclosing personal information, citing three types of consent under PIPA, which is express consent, implied consent, and opt-out consent.

Since many of the staff at the Haidilao restaurant are Chinese citizens and work under the Temporary Foreign Worker Program in Canada, and are already listed in the Social Credit system in China as citizens of China, they aren’t likely to demand privacy under Canadian law. Even staff members who live in Canada permanently with “permanent resident status” face the same pressure to conform to China’s mandatory CSCS program, because China doesn’t consider individuals with permanent resident status in Canada unless they renounce their Chinese citizenship. “Consent” isn’t an option in totalitarian regimes.

SAFETY OF WORKERS AND PRIVACY OF CITIZENS

We asked the Minister of Labour in British Columbia, Harry Bains, if he was aware that China’s social credit program was active in BC, and if he had any plans to update labour laws to protect employees—both foreign and domestic—to prevent punishment of overseas employees working in BC. The Minister didn’t answer the question at all, choosing instead to have Lisa Beare, the Minister of Citizens’ Services in British Columbia, who is in charge of governing PIPA legislation, respond. Lisa Beare also didn’t respond directly to the question either, instead the Ministry provided a boiler plate response to say that they expect organizations to essentially adhere to the honour system by following current privacy legislation. “The Province expects organizations to follow Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) in regards to the handling of British Columbians’ personal information.” There was no mention by Ms Beare of government plans to update legislation to reflect current privacy concerns around China’s intrusion into the Canadians’ right to privacy.

NATIONAL SECURITY

A more insidious aspect to China’s CSCS is that it can be used to spy on Canadian citizens under the pretence of being a part of China’s social credit program. Canadian authorities may take the approach that CSCS has nothing to do with Canada and our laws. However, the Haidilao hot pot restaurant manager clearly stated that there were two reasons for the surveillance cameras, for both social credit and state security purposes. In all likelihood, next-generation data sources—such as information from facial recognition-driven video feeds, cell phone surveillance and e-com purchase history—are being collected from Canadians while they eat and it wouldn’t be the first time that the CCP has filmed Canadians inside Canada.

Over the past couple of years, an ever-expanding collection of surveillance cameras have been added to the Vancouver PRC Consulate, located in the prestigious Shaughnessy district of Vancouver, on the edge of a high traffic road that goes into the City. The surveillance camera has been installed on the edge of the property, one of which jettisons out into Canadian space, then retracts back. The street is a frequent place for pro-Hong Kong activists, Uyghurs protesting genocide, Iranians protesting the cooperation pact with China and members of Falun Gong protesting persecution. Canada is a multicultural country that has opened its doors to countless refugees fleeing persecution and promotes equality and the right to free speech as a core value. Yet Canada’s elected officials have done little if anything to ensure that the very people we have invited into Canada are promised a safe haven from the oppressive regimes they fled from in the first place.

The cameras used by the PRC consulate are the same cameras that the US banned the purchase and use of under the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) as a cyber security threat.

In 2019, Global Affairs, the department of the Government of Canada that manages Canada’s diplomatic and consular relations, also doesn’t appear to concerned that the Government of China is spying on Canadians with cameras installed on embassy grounds that jettison out into Canadian space, naively suggesting that addressing the matter is left to the Peoples Republic of China and the “honor” system of having a duty to adhere to Canadian laws.

“Diplomatic and consular representatives have a duty to respect local laws, and there is a similar expectation for the manner in which foreign missions operate. In Canada, there is an expectation that foreign missions comply with federal, provincial, and municipal laws and regulations, including those that governs the use of physical security equipment, such as cameras, fences, and lights.”

WHY MAKE IT SO OBVIOUS?

Why install over 60 security cameras in a restaurant if you don’t want customers to ask questions? Restaurant manager Ryan Pan did say that the company had a very strict food safety discipline. The chain suffered an embarrassing public incident at one of its Beijing restaurant s a number of years ago that could be used to justify as an overreaction to installing so many cameras.

However, there is little doubt that Chinese surveillance within Canada can be correlated to the CCP’s need for control of its citizens. By establishing this capability within Canada, through what is believed to be capitalist corporate enterprise, the Chinese are able to identify Canada’s response. The restaurant in this case, with its “over-the-top” large volume of surveillance cameras could actually be a penetration test that measures vulnerability, as well as the reactions Canadian law enforcement and general public display.

Passive responses by Canada’s elected officials, law enforcement, and security intelligence agencies only serve to embolden influence operations, which have historically been the standard by which the Chinese base their tactics. The potential for further technology-based exploitation inside Canada will most assuredly increase.

In a rare public statement made on 9 February 2021, Director David Vigneault of Canada’s Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) had this to say about the threat to Canada’s National Security by the Government of China: “To be clear, the threat does not come from the Chinese people, but rather the Government of China that is pursuing a strategy for geopolitical advantage on all fronts-economic, technical, political, and military-and using all elements of state power to carry out activities that are a direct threat to our national security and sovereignty. We must all strengthen our defenses.”

Despite Canada’s security intelligence agency warning Canadians and elected officials about the threat to Canada’s national security, Canada’s Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, has enjoyed the benefits of a very cozy relationship with China and isn’t likely to implement any significant changes to law that might affect that relationship.

We asked the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) if Prime Minister Trudeau was aware that China’s Corporate Social Credit System is now operational in Canada and if he was aware that Canadian citizens were having their biometric information taken via video surveillance and sent back to China. We also asked, what if anything did he intend to do legislatively to address CSCS in Canada.

The Prime Minister’s Office did not respond by deadline.

Ivy Li said this in response to the Prime Minister of Canada’s apparent lack of concern over China surveillance of Canadian citizens; “What is most chilling as a Canadian is that, knowing the Chinese Communist Party ‘Social Credit System’ is able to operate in Canada openly, yet our governments at all levels have no measures to stop it, to prevent it from replicating across the country, and to protect Canadians from being spied on directly through private companies by a dictatorial regime who is currently committing genocide, forced-labour, on-demand organ harvesting, and crushing the basic rights of Hong Kong citizens. That regime is coming for us. CCP’s social credit system should be made illegal in Canada, and sharing our information live with a foreign regime’s suppressive surveillance system by a private business should be a criminal offence. Official policy must be brough in ASAP to stamp out such practices.”

The ultimate question is: how many companies in Canada have installed surveillance systems at the behest of the CCP for the purpose of fulfilling their obligation to the Corporate Social Credit System? Is this just the start or is the system already well underway? Is Canada prepared to address China’s Social Credit System operating inside Canada from a labour, human rights, privacy, and national security perspective or will Canada’s elected officials just wish it all away and appease the CCP instead of protecting its citizens and living up to best practices under the 5eyes partnership alliance?

The high-ranking diplomat was nabbed during a meeting with a Russian citizen who allegedly provided him with secret data.

The diplomat, identified as Alexander Sosonyuk, was arrested in Russia's second city on Friday, the Federal Security Service (FSB) said on Friday. The diplomat was detained while having “a meeting with a Russian citizen, during which he received secret information from law enforcement and FSB databases,” the agency said in a statement.

“Such activity is incompatible with the status of a diplomatic worker and is openly hostile towards Russia. The foreign diplomat will be subjected to measures applied under international law,” the FSB added.

While the agency did not elaborate on the fate of Sosonyuk, he’s likely to be declared a persona non grata and expelled from Russia shortly. It also remained unclear whether any other individual, including Sosonyuk’s Russian contact, has been detained in the aftermath of the ill-fated meeting.

Ukraine has acknowledged the incident, rejecting the allegations and accusing Russia of “hostile” behavior.

“We’ll be working to bring him home soon. Our diplomat has no connection to the activities Russian law enforcement accuse him of,” Ukraine’s Deputy Foreign minister Yevgeniy Yenin told Ukraine 24 TV channel.

It was a truly impressive TV moment, and it may represent a whole new chapter for the dining brand.” Cillizza added that a fact check would be forthcoming, but there was no doubt that the message of delicious and convenient food had stuck a chord with wide swaths of Americans.

""...Even the smallest doses of its extract have strong negative effect on the body and the person might quickly die,"" she added. ""We are falling back into the Middle Ages.""

While promoting aconitum soongaricum, Japarov also urged Kyrgyz citizens to wear masks and vaccinate, saying that so far only 4,000 people have received shots in a country of six million, a sign of ""extreme indifference"".

I ignored all the warning signs: the increasingly hostile behavior, the isolation, the white nationalist literature all over his scratching pad. I have a lot to learn if I ever want to be a dad.” DeSpiegler admitted he should have taken a tougher look at himself last year after his pet hamster burned down his woodshed.

0,Black Lives Matter founder Patrisse Khan-Cullors breaks down in interview over right-wing attacks on her new home,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/patrisse-cullors-blm-founder-home-b1832846.html,"Black Lives Matter (BLM) co-founder Patrisse Cullors held back tears while discussing criticism she faced last week over her housing portfolio, worth $3m (£2.17m).

Ms Cullors, 37, who created the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter in 2013 and later co-founded the Black Lives Matter Network, was criticised last week after the New York Post revealed that she had spent $1.4m (£1.017m) on a Los Angeles property, her third residence in the city and fourth overall.

She has bought two other homes in the Los Angeles area over the last few years, which sit in her portfolio alongside a 3.2-acre property in Georgia that she purchased for $415,000 (£301,950).

Questions were raised about how the director of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation had acquired the funds to pay for the properties, with Black sports journalist Jason Whitlock accusing her and other BLM founders of “making millions of dollars off the backs of these dead Black men who they wouldn’t spit on if they were on fire and alive”.

However, during an interview with Marc Lamont Hill for Black News Tonight on Thursday, Ms Cullors described the scrutiny over her homes as a “racist and sexist” attack by the “right-wing media”.

Ms Cullors also rejected claims that the purchases go against her self-described ideology as a “trained Marxist”, explaining that she bought the homes for her family, and defines her wealth “as my family’s money, as well”.

She added: “I think that is critique that is wanting. The way that I live my life is a direct support to Black people, including my Black family members, first and foremost.

“For so many Black folks who are able to invest in themselves and their communities they choose to invest in their family and that is what I have chosen to do.”

Ms Cullors then told Mr Hill that she thinks the criticism over her properties is part of an effort to discredit her work and BLM’s activism.

“The whole point of these articles and these attacks against me are to discredit me, but also to discredit the movement,” she said.

“We have to stay focused on white supremacy,’ she added as she urged people to ‘see through the right-wing lies,’” Ms Cullors added.

After being asked how she has coped with the criticism by Mr Hill, she then held back tears and revealed that she hired security last week after the initial reports came out and her new home was pictured in the media.

“I spent the last week with security and these articles have shown the homes that I live in and that my family lives in,” she said as she held back tears.

“I have not just been a target of white supremacists and the right in this moment but obviously since the beginning of when I started Black Lives Matter I have been a target and these folks have created a much more dangerous situation for me and my family. It is very serious.”

The criticism last week prompted BLM to release a statement on Tuesday denying paying for the properties.

The group revealed that Ms Cullors has not been paid by them since 2019 and that she had only received around $120,000 (£87,234) since the organisation’s founding in 2013, for “duties such as serving as spokesperson and engaging in political education work”.

BLM added: “All Black activists know the fear these malicious and serious actions are meant to instil: the fear of being silenced, the trauma of being targeted, the torture of feeling one’s family is exposed to danger just for speaking out against unjust systems.

“We have seen this tactic of terror time and again, but our movement will not be silenced.”

Since helping found BLM in 2013 following George Zimmerman’s acquittal for killing Trayvon Martin, Ms Cullors has written a best-selling memoir and has signed a deal to create content with Warner Bros.

Now, look, obviously I’m fine with that, nothing wrong with decapitating and eating chickens all day every day. It’s her hypocrisy that gets to me.” Hastings has also claimed that she was still meat-free despite taking a “cheat day” once a month to jump the fence at a nearby farm, use a bolt gun on the first cow she came across, and feast on the warm brains and marrow.

Russian authorities demanded earlier this year that DOXA take down its video explaining that students shouldn't be afraid to voice their opinions at a Jan. 23 pro-Navalny protest and that it was unlawful for universities to expel students who attend. DOXA said it had deleted the video at the authorities’ request and maintains that it contained no calls to illegal activity.

Russian police have raided independent student news site DOXA’s Moscow offices and charged its editors with inciting minors to illegally protest, the outlet said Wednesday.

“Today at 6 a.m. [security officers] carried out searches at the DOXA office and the homes of editors Armen Aramyan, Vladimir Metelkin, Alla Gutnikova and Natasha Tyshkevich,” the outlet said on its website.

The four editors were then charged after being taken in for questioning by investigators.

According to human rights lawyer Pavel Chikov, their charges fall under the same case opened against top Navalny aide Leonid Volkov, who was charged in absentia as he is based in Lithuania.

On Wednesday afternoon, dozens of supporters, mostly young people, gathered outside Moscow's Basmanny District Court, where the editors were due to be sentenced to pre-trial restraints.

“I came here to support Natasha [Tyshkevich],” Anna, 26, told The Moscow Times. “I believe the whole case has been fabricated and politically motivated. I also believe that journalistic activities should not succumb to political repressions.”

Leonid, 22, chief editor of the city of Kazan's first independent student-run outlet, said he came to show his support and solidarity with DOXA, who he said set an example for university students nationwide.

“Unfortunately in Russia, everything is arranged so that there are five or six truly independent student publications. There are many of them in general, but very few are willing to criticize the academic community,” he said.

A Moscow court late Wednesday ordered the four journalists to follow restrictions including a ban on phone and internet communications and leaving their homes from 00:00 to 23:59, the Mediazona news website reported. Metelkin called the measures ""essentially house arrest.""

DOXA said in a statement that it will “continue to cover things that are important for young people, and we will continue to stand up for their rights.”

“The pressure that the journalistic community has faced lately is unprecedented, but we will not stop our activities,” the statement said.",408,2606,9,64

0,The Saudi Royal Family May Have Paid $450 Million For A Fake Leonardo da Vinci Painting,https://www.celebritynetworth.com/articles/billionaire-news/the-saudi-royal-family-may-have-paid-450-million-for-a-fake-leonardo-da-vinci-painting-a-painting/,"In November 2017, Christie's auction house offered a 500-year-old painting to the highest bidder. Officially titled ""Salvator Mundi"", but nicknamed the ""male Mona Lisa"", a 20-minute bidding war waged between a half dozen buyers from all over the world. Bids, which went up in $10 million increments, were made by billionaires and museum curators in China, the US, Qatar, Russia and Saudi Arabia.

Before the auction opened, the 500-year-old Leonardo da Vinci painting was estimated to sell for $100 million.

The final winning bid?

$450 million

That price more than doubled the previously-held record for most-expensive piece of art sold at public auction.

The previous record for a public art auction was $179 million paid in 2015 for Pablo Picasso's 1955 piece ""Women of Algiers (Version O)"". The buyer was former Qatari prime minister, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani.

The $450 million purchase also significantly topped the previously-held record for a private art sale. The previous known record for a private sale was $300 million paid in 2015 for a Paul Gauguin. The buyer in that case was a museum in Qatar.

After the smoke cleared, the winner of the $450 million da Vinci auction was revealed to be the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, AKA ""MBS"".

There's now a teeny tiny problem with MBS' $450 million ""Salvator Mundi"".

Upon closer investigation, it may not actually be a 100% authentic da Vinci.

This claim is according to a new documentary called ""The Savior for Sale"".

In the documentary, art analysts allege that although the painting was produced in one of da Vinci's workshops, the legendary genius might have, at most, only ""contributed"" to the painting.

$1,175

That's how much ""Salvator Mundi"" would have cost you in 2005.

""Salvator Mundi"" was sold for just $1,175 in 2005 by an art dealer in New York. That's not a typo. You could have bought this $450 million painting for a little more than half a ""stimmy"" check just 16 years ago. After undergoing a restoration, it was authenticated by several British art experts as a long-lost da Vinci.

It was then displayed at London's National Gallery as such. It sold in 2013 to a Russian oligarch for $127.5 million.

The oligarch was the seller in 2017 when MBS scooped it up for $450 million.

The painting has not been seen publicly since the sale. Most people assumed it was hanging on the wall of some Saudi castle or being stored at a highly-secure art warehouse in Switzerland.

In reality, it was indeed hanging on a wall. But not in a castle… on MBS' $500 million yacht ""Serene"":

And while Serene does have two helipads, a climbing wall, a dozen luxury cabins and three swimming pools, the art world was shocked to learn this is where a da Vinci was being stored. A yacht, even one that cost $500 million, likely does not have the required temperature controls or protection from salty air needed to store a 500-year-old painting.

After winning the auction in 2017, the original plan was to display the painting at the Louvre Abu Dhabi in neighboring United Arab Emirates for around two years. Then in late 2019 the painting was to be moved to the Louvre in Paris which was unveiling a massive exhibit to mark the 500th anniversary of Leonardo da Vinci's death.

A curator at the Louvre planned to display a history of the painting that included research which his team showed da Vinci at least painted the Christ figure in the painting.

That news was very well-received back in Saudi Arabia. It would essentially be a permanent stamp of approval proving they did not pay $450 million for a fake painting.

The documentary, ""The Savior for Sale"" claims that some members of the French government lobbied on behalf of Bin Salman, due to a concern over the strategic and economic relationship between France and Saudi Arabia.

In the end, President Macron denied Salman's request to give the painting an official stamp of approval from his government.

This left it to the Louvre to negotiate with the Saudi royal family.

Then a second major bone of contention popped up between the Louvre and MBS.

This bone of contention was related to the actual placement of the painting at the Louvre.

MBS insisted his painting be displayed nearly side-by-side with da Vinci's most-famous masterpiece, the ""Mona Lisa"". The Louvre refused, arguing that the Mona Lisa is held in a custom-constructed room that can barely accommodate the 30,000 daily visitors she sees today.

A compromise was not reached and MBS' da Vinci was shuttled back to an undisclosed location in Saudi Arabia where it will ultimately be displayed in a yet-to-built local museum.

As of this writing there has not been a 100% conclusion on the painting's authenticity.",803,4739,16,87

A diplomatic source cited by Interfax suggested the expulsions could prompt Russia to shut the Czech Republic's embassy in Moscow.

""There is well-grounded suspicion about the involvement of officers of the Russian intelligence service GRU... in the explosion of [an] ammunitions depot in the Vrbetice area,"" Babis told a briefing shown live on television.

Hamacek said 18 Russian embassy staff identified as secret service personnel would be ordered to leave the NATO country within 48 hours.

Several explosions shook the Vrbetice ammunition depot, 330km southeast of Prague, on October 16, 2014. They killed two employees of a private company that was renting the depot from a state military organisation.

The Czech Republic said Sunday it had informed NATO and European Union allies that it suspected Russia of causing the blast, and European Union foreign ministers were set to discuss the matter at their meeting on Monday.

A NATO official said that the alliance would support the Czech Republic as it investigated Russia's ""malign activities"", which were part of a pattern of ""dangerous behaviour"".

""Those responsible must be brought to justice,"" added the official, who declined to be named.

British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab tweeted that the Czechs ""have exposed the lengths that the GRU will go to in their attempts to conduct dangerous and malign operations"".

Washington also offered Prague its support.

The Interfax news agency cited Vladimir Dzhabarov, first deputy head of the upper house's international affairs committee, as saying Prague's claims were absurd and Russia's response should be proportionate.

The expulsions prompted Russia’s Foreign Ministry to vow on Sunday to ""force the authors of this provocation to fully understand their responsibility for destroying the foundation of normal ties between our countries"".

Moscow took the first steps Sunday by summoning the Czech ambassador in Russia to the foreign ministry.

The row is the biggest between Prague and Moscow since the end of decades of Soviet domination of eastern Europe in 1989.

Separately, Czech police said on Saturday they were searching for two men carrying various passports, including Russian ones in the names of Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov. The men are wanted for their potential role in the 2014 explosion, the organised crime squad (NCOZ) said on its website.

Those names were the aliases used by two Russian military intelligence officers who British prosecutors charged with the attempted murder on British soil of Russian spy Sergei Skripal.

They and Moscow both denied involvement.

Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with a nerve agent in the English city of Salisbury in March 2018.

The attack prompted the biggest wave of diplomatic expulsions between Moscow and the West since the Cold War.

On Thursday, the parliament voted unanimously to make rape with children below 15 a punishable offence, inviting up to 20 years in jail.

The long stand-law comes after the country was rocked by series of sex abuse scandals for years and allegations of incestuous abuse plagued the French elite.

“This is an historic law for our children and our society,” justice minister Éric Dupond-Moretti said in the National Assembly on Thursday.

The activists and supporters believe that the new law will make it easy to prosecute predators and serial offenders.

“No adult aggressor will be able to claim the consent of a minor younger than 15 years old,” Mr Dupond-Moretti said.

Previous laws allowed consent of a person to be accepted by the court irrespective of the age, that included adults having sex with children or making incest relations.

Although the sex between adults and under-5s was prohibited but allowed consent of under 15s, making it extremely difficult for the prosecutors to prove allegations of child rape.

However, a so-called ""Romeo and Juliet"" clause was added to the law which still makes it possible for teenagers to consent to sex with a minor, who is above five years of age. The clause will not apply to cases of sexual assault.

This clause was added after concerns were raised by lawmakers that setting the age of consent at 15 will automatically criminalise a sexual relationship between young partners of the same age.

The legislation has also toughened laws on incestuous sex as thousands of women who were the victim of the sexual crimes testified they were abused by their relatives.

The country that has long cherished its image as the land of seduction and romance was marred by exposé of sex scandals after the #MeToo swept across France after step daughter of prominent academic Olivier Duhamel was accused of abusing her twin brother as a child.

It led to more people coming forward to testify with the hashtag #MeTooIncest.

The country previously toughened sex crimes laws in 2018 when it outlawed sexual harassment on the streets, with spot-on fines for eve-teasers and catcallers.",471,2916,12,66

Deputy Chief Craig McCartt on Friday afternoon identified the gunman as 19-year-old Brandon Hole, who was last employed by FedEx in 2020.

Hole was found dead of a gunshot wound that appeared to be self-inflicted, McCartt said.

In March 2020, Hole's mother told law enforcement that he might attempt ""suicide by cop,"" the FBI's Indianapolis office said in a statement.

Special Agent in Charge Paul Keenan said Hole was placed on an immediate mental health temporary hold by the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department. He also said a shotgun was seized at Hole's residence.

""Based on items observed in the suspect's bedroom at that time, he was interviewed by the FBI in April 2020,"" the statement said. ""No Racially Motivated Violent Extremism (RMVE) ideology was identified during the course of the assessment and no criminal violation was found. The shotgun was not returned to the suspect.""

McCartt told reporters that Indianapolis police found Hole's name in two past incident reports. The deputy chief didn't have information about the first report. The details he described from a 2020 report align with the FBI statement.

Investigators are trying to determine motive and were searching what they believe is the suspected gunman's home, Keenan told reporters late Friday morning.

When asked what brought the suspected gunman to the FedEx facility Thursday around 11 p.m., McCartt said: ""I wish we could answer that.""

On Friday evening, Indianapolis police released the names of the eight deceased victims. They are: Matthew R. Alexander, 32; Samaria Blackwell, 19; Amarjeet Johal, 66; Jaswinder Kaur, 64; Jaswinder Singh, 68; Amarjit Sekhon, 48; Karli Smith, 19; and John Weisert, 74.

A statement by IMPD said the next of kin has been notified by the Marion County Coroner's Office. The cause of death will be determined after autopsies are complete, according to the statement.

IMPD said the names of those injured are not being released.

The mass shooting is the country's deadliest since 10 people were killed March 22 at a grocery store in Boulder, Colorado

Thursday night's killings began when a gunman ""got out of his car, and pretty quickly started some random shooting outside the facility,"" McCartt said.

The gunman then ""went inside and did not get very far into the facility at all,"" while shooting others there, McCartt told CNN earlier Friday.

A crime lab technician works Friday in the parking lot of the site of the mass shooting at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis.

Laveda Chester told CNN's ""OutFront with Erin Burnett"" that she was arriving for her overnight shift when she heard one pop and thought it might be a car accident. She said she looked around and didn't see one. But then she saw the gunman running toward the building with a rifle in his hand.

She waited until he went in so she could drive away without drawing the gunman's attention. She went to another parking lot and called police. She said she then tried to warn other arriving workers that there was a shooting going on. Some stopped and some drove past her.

Two employees inside the building at the time heard as many as 10 gunshots, they told CNN affiliate WISH . The men left the building and watched as about 30 police cars responded, they said.

""Thank God for being here because I thought I was going to get shot,"" one of them, Jeremiah Miller, told WISH.

Investigators have heard the shooting lasted ""just a couple minutes -- that it did not last very long,"" McCartt said.

""My understanding is, by the time that officers entered ... the situation was over -- that the suspect took his life very shortly before officers entered the facility,"" McCartt told reporters.

There were at least 100 people in the facility when the shooting began, he said. Many were on their dinner break or changing shifts.

Four people were found dead outside and four others, not counting the shooter, were dead inside, McCartt said.

The incident marks at least the 45th mass shooting in the United States since the Atlanta-area spa shootings on March 16. CNN considers an incident to be a mass shooting if four or more people, excluding the gunman, are wounded or killed by gunfire.

President Joe Biden ordered flags at federal facilities to be lowered to half-staff and urged Congress to act on firearm legislation, calling gun violence an ""epidemic.""

Several people wounded

McCartt said four survivors were taken to a hospital with gunshot wounds and a fifth person sought treatment in another county for a gunshot wound. Two people were treated at the scene, he said.

The gunman had at least one weapon, which investigators believe was a rifle, McCartt told reporters.

Police early Friday were trying to make sense of the crime scene while relatives of FedEx employees gathered at a nearby hotel, which officials offered as a place where they could await news, reunite with the workers and meet with police chaplains.

""Many of the employees did not have cell phones on them in the facility,"" and so many survivors were not immediately able to contact their families, McCartt told CNN.

Several people tearfully embraced as they reunited Friday morning at the hotel, video from CNN affiliate WISH showed.

When asked Friday morning whether witnesses indicated that FedEx or security personnel had any indication that something like Friday's shooting would happen, McCartt said no.

""We're still working with FedEx security for anything that might have been an indication this was going to happen right now,"" McCartt said at the Friday morning news conference.

'They didn't sound like gunshots at first'

FedEx worker Timothy Boillat and his coworker heard what they thought initially were ""two loud metal clangs"" when the shooting started, he told CNN affiliate WRTV

""They didn't sound like gunshots at first ... Then, we heard three more shots, and then my buddy ... saw someone running out of the building."" Boillat said.

""And then more shots went off. Somebody went behind their car to the trunk and got another gun,"" Boillat said, without saying whether that person was the shooter.

""And then I saw one body on the floor,"" Boillat told WRTV.

Police are asking anyone who was at the scene and may have left for safety or for medical treatment to contact them to provide information on the shooting.

Family members await information about their loved ones.

Governor and other officials offer condolences

Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett said the process of healing will be impacted in part by what conversations the nation has about cycles of violence ""driven by readily accessible guns.""

""We must guard against resignation or even despair -- the assumption that this is simply how it must be and that we might as well get used to it. We need the courage that compels courageous acts that push past weariness,"" Hogsett said.

FedEx released a statement saying it was ""deeply shocked and saddened by the loss of our team members.""

""Our most heartfelt sympathies are with all those affected by this senseless act of violence. The safety of our team members is our top priority, and we are fully cooperating with investigating authorities,"" FedEx said

Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb said Friday is ""another heartbreaking day and I'm shaken by the mass shooting at the FedEx Ground facility in Indianapolis.""

""In times like this, words like justice and sorrow fall short in response for those senselessly taken. Our thoughts are with the families, friends, coworkers and all those affected by this terrible situation,"" Holcomb said.

Flags will be lowered to half-staff from Friday until sunset Tuesday ""in remembrance of those we've lost,"" Holcomb said.

""Nothing we learn can heal the wounds of those who escaped with their lives, but who will now ... endure the memories of this horrific crime,"" Hogsett said.

US Rep. Andre Carson, whose district includes Indianapolis, tweeted that he was heartbroken by the mass shooting.

""I am communicating with local authorities to get all details of the attack and my office stands ready to help everyone affected any way we can,"" he said.

1,California Firefighters Massage 2.5 Million Gallons Of Moisturizer Into Forests To Prevent Dryness,https://www.theonion.com/california-firefighters-massage-2-5-million-gallons-of-1845159161,"SANTA ROSA, CA—Reminding the public that “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,” the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection reportedly massaged 2.5 million gallons of moisturizer into parched state forests Tuesday to break the cycle of dryness that has led to continual flare-ups. “The number one cause of forest fire breakouts is dry brush, which is best treated by saturating the affected area with a lubricating cream designed to lock in moisture,” said California Fire Chief Thom Porter as he gently worked three quarts of lavender-scented lotion into the rough, cracked trunk of a 300-foot redwood. “We chose a hypoallergenic, coconut milk-based emulsion that not only replenishes lost chloroplast lipids, but also uses a hyaluronic acid to boost the brushwood’s natural moisture production, ensuring our vegetation remains thoroughly hydrated without developing oily bark. We’ll be applying the cream in gentle, circular motions from the Bay Area down through the Sierra Nevada region and all the way up to the Oregon border. Then we’ll follow with a gentle SPF 30 setting spray to prevent further sun damage to the already crispy leaves.” Porter added that while the program is expensive, taxpayers save millions thanks to state prison inmates, who are paid $1 per acre to administer the forests’ autumn exfoliation regimen.

0,Czech Republic - Czech police hunt two men with names matching Skripal suspects - News follows announcement of expulsion of 18 Russia diplomats identified as spies linked to 2014 blast that killed two people,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/17/czech-police-hunt-two-men-with-names-matching-skripal-suspects,"Czech police have said they are seeking two Russian men in connection with a 2014 blast that killed two people. The men, they said, hold passports used by the suspects in the attempted poisoning of Sergei Skripal.

The names match those used by the two men accused of poisoning Skripal and his daughter Yulia with the Soviet-era nerve agent novichok in the English city of Salisbury in 2018. Russia denied involvement in the poisoning, but about 300 diplomats were sent home in subsequent tit-for-tat expulsions.

“The two men were present on Czech territory in … October 2014,” when the Vrbetice blast occurred, the Czech organised crime squad said on Saturday, adding that they also used Tajik and Moldovan identities.

The Czech government had earlier said it was expelling 18 Russian diplomats identified by local intelligence as secret agents of the Russian SVR and GRU services that are suspected of involvement in a 2014 explosion.

“Eighteen employees of the Russian embassy must leave our republic within 48 hours,” the interim foreign minister, Jan Hamáček, told reporters.

Hamáček said on Twitter on Sunday that he would discuss the matter at an EU foreign ministers’ meeting on Monday.

The prime minister, Andrej Babiš, said Czech authorities had “clear evidence” linking GRU officers to the explosion in an ammunition warehouse in 2014 that left two people dead.

“We have good reason to suspect the involvement of GRU officers from unit 29155 in the explosion at the ammunition warehouse in Vrbetice,” in the east of the country, Babiš said. He added he had received the information on Friday, without explaining why it had taken so long.

“The explosion led to huge material damage and posed a serious threat to the lives of many local people, but above all it killed two of our fellow citizens, fathers of families.”

Hamáček, who is the interior minister as well as serving as interim foreign minister after his predecessor was sacked earlier this week, said he was sorry that the incident would “fundamentally damage Czech-Russian relations”.

“We are in a situation similar to that in Britain following the attempted poisoning in Salisbury in 2018,” he said, referring to the case of Skripal.

Hamáček said he had summoned the Russian ambassador, Alexander Zmeyevsky, on Saturday evening to tell him about the decision.

On Thursday, the Czech Republic’s neighbour Poland said it had expelled three Russian diplomats for “carrying out activities to the detriment” of Poland.

Warsaw also expressed solidarity with the US, which earlier that day had announced sanctions and the expulsion of 10 Russian diplomats in retaliation for what Washington said was the Kremlin’s US election interference, a massive cyber-attack and other hostile activity.

Gamers, this is bad. This is really bad. We don’t know how this happened exactly, but we were just playing a game of Super Mario Party a few minutes ago when Mario and Yoshi used a warp box at the same time and... dear God—emerged onto the board as a horrifying, fused monstrosity.



Advertisement

Holy shit, this is really bad. We don’t want to look. But we cannot stop ourselves.

Gamers, we are nauseated just looking at the grotesque mass of green flesh pulsing over Mario’s iconic red hat. But what’s worse is we can’t even say for certain what occurred during that warp to cause this moral trespass. All that’s clear is both Yoshi and Mario were holding warp boxes at the time, and when Mario used his to swap places, it seems like Yoshi accidentally activated his own, splicing their genetic code together into... into this... Jesus, we’re going to be sick.



One thing that’s obvious is that dinosaur and human DNA are not a good match, and this ungodly creature seems to be in deep pain. It’s pulsating with tumors or cysts or something, and fluid is leaking out all over from the burst pustules. Oh Christ, Yoshi’s red tongue is twitching around horribly on the outside of its body.

What inhuman horror have these two wrought?



As terrible as this misbegotten creature is, what’s scaring us even more is the fear and revulsion reflected in the eyes of the other game characters in King Bob-omb’s Powderkeg Mine. Peach just fell to the ground racked with sobs and is trying to tear her own eyes out. Meanwhile, Donkey Kong apparently went mad, because he immediately started screaming in madness and then leaped off the map into the lava below rather than look one more moment upon this repulsive hybrid.



Oh, no, no, no, there’s a sound coming from the unspeakable thing’s throat now—a wet hiss, a weeping scream emanating out of its dual-tongued mouth. It wants us to come closer, but we can’t. We won’t let this thing come close. No way.



Oh, fuck, what’s it doing? Fuck, FUCK, it’s dragging itself towards the railroad tracks—it looks like it’s trying to run itself over with a mine cart, but its poor, decrepit body doesn’t have the strength to make it that far. Sweet mother of Christ, we don’t know what we did to deserve seeing this, but now the monstrosity is looking right at us through the screen and begging us to come over there to end its torture.

0,Buckingham Palace announces guest list for Philip's funeral,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/15/uk/prince-philip-funeral-arrangements-gbr-intl/index.html,"Windsor, England (CNN) Buckingham Palace has revealed the 30 people who will make up the congregation at the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral service on Saturday.

However, the remembrance will retain the colorful traditions of a royal funeral and ""are a reflection of The Duke's military affiliations and personal elements of His Royal Highness's life,"" a Buckingham Palace spokesman said Thursday.

Members of the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery ride away from Windsor Castle, west of London, on April 15.

Soldiers from the Welsh Guards bow their heads as they rehearse for Prince Philip's funeral in Woking, England on Wednesday.

The palace spokesman said the family was ""grateful"" for the condolence messages sent from across the globe.

""The tributes received from young and old are truly a testament to the remarkable life and lasting endeavors of His Royal Highness,"" he added.

Over 700 Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, British Army and Royal Air Force will provide ceremonial support during the funeral.

Princes William and Harry will reunite to walk behind the Duke of Edinburgh's coffin with their father, Charles, and other members of the royal family as part of a private procession ahead of the funeral service on Saturday.

While the Queen will not take part in the procession before the service, Prince Charles and his sister Princess Anne will follow a specially modified Land Rover, which will carry the Duke's coffin to the chapel. The journey is expected to take around eight minutes.

Their siblings, Edward and Andrew, will participate in the procession immediately behind them. William and Harry will come next though they will be separated from walking together by their cousin Peter Philips. And behind them will be the final family members, Anne's husband, Vice Admiral Tim Laurence, and the Earl of Snowdon.

Royals who are not involved in the procession such as the Duchess of Cornwall and Duchess of Cambridge will join the 94-year-old monarch to watch the funeral parade outside the chapel's Galilee Porch. This also includes blood relatives from the Duke's side who will be in attendance including Philip's great nephews, the Hereditary Prince of Baden and the Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg.

The decision for some royals to walk behind the coffin will inevitably draw comparisons to Princess Diana's funeral in 1997 when Charles, William and Harry participated in a similar procession alongside Prince Philip and Diana's brother Earl Spencer.

Saturday's memorial will be unlike any other recent royal funerals due to the coronavirus pandemic. The congregation will wear masks for the duration of the service, the palace spokesman said.

In line with the Duke's wishes, it will be a ceremonial funeral, rather than a state event, and all arrangements are set to take place within Windsor Castle without public engagement making sure to adhere to existing Covid measures.

In a break with tradition, members of the royal family will not be dressed in military uniform and instead don morning coats with medals or day dress, the spokesman added.

The subject of clothing emerged in recent days after some British media reported Prince Andrew wished to wear an admiral's uniform. Andrew stepped back from his royal duties in 2019 over his ties to disgraced financier and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein

The Duke of York joined the Royal Navy in 1979 as a Seaman Officer, sub-specializing as a pilot. He was promoted to the rank of vice-admiral in 2015 when he turned 55. He was due to be elevated to admiral upon his 60th birthday but that did not come to be in the wake of a disastrous interview with the BBC when he discussed his relationship with Epstein.

The decision against uniforms will also solve a dilemma facing the family as Prince Harry recently lost his honorary military titles when he chose to step down as a senior royal with his wife Meghan last March.

Harry was enlisted with the British Armed Forces for nearly a decade before ending his military service in 2015 . He served two tours in Afghanistan and achieved the rank of captain in 2011. He has also qualified as an Apache Aircraft commander.

During the service, a choir of four will sing music selected by Philip for the occasion. They will be seated in the nave, socially distanced from the assembled family members and close aides. One notable absence will be the lack of congregational singing which is currently prohibited by public health guidelines.

Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall view the flowers and messages of condolence left outside Buckingham Palace.

Following the service, the coffin will be lowered in the Royal Vault below the chapel as the choir sings the national anthem.

In the meantime, maybe I could interest you in the new Jodi Picoult?

REUTERS/Tom Brenner

President Joe Biden on Friday sought to present a united front with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to counter an increasingly assertive China as the U.S. leader held his first face-to-face White House summit since taking office.

The talks offered the Democratic president, inaugurated in January, a chance to work further on his pledge to revitalize U.S. alliances that frayed under his Republican predecessor Donald Trump.

China topped the agenda, underscoring Japan’s central role in U.S. efforts to face down Beijing. The two leaders addressed an array of geopolitical issues in a joint statement, including “the importance of peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait,” a slap at Beijing’s increased military pressure on the Chinese-claimed, self-ruled island.

“Today Prime Minister Suga and I affirmed our ironclad support for the U.S.-Japanese alliance and for our shared security,” Biden told a joint news conference in the White House Rose Garden, calling the discussions “productive.”

“We committed to working together to take on the challenges from China and on issues like the East China Sea, the South China Sea, as well as North Korea, to ensure a future of a free and open Indo Pacific.”

Other pressing concerns at the talks included China’s increased military movements near Taiwan, its tightening grip on Hong Kong and its crackdown on Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang.

Suga said he and Biden agreed on the necessity of frank discussions with China in the context of Beijing’s activities in the Indo-Pacific region.

In a strongly worded statement on Saturday, China’s embassy in Washington said Beijing was “resolutely opposed” to the joint statement, and that Taiwan, Hong Kong and Xinjiang were China’s internal affairs.

The remarks have “completely gone beyond the scope of the normal development of bilateral relations”, harming the interests of third parties as well as peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific, the embassy said.

The move was an attempt to split the region that “will inevitably proceed with the purpose of harming others and end in harming themselves”, it added.

The summit - Biden’s first in-person meeting with a foreign leader as president - came just days after China sent 25 aircraft, including fighters and nuclear-capable bombers, near Taiwan, which Beijing considers a wayward province.

“I refrain from mentioning details, since it pertains to diplomatic exchanges, but there is already an agreed recognition over the importance of peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait between Japan and the United States, which was reaffirmed on this occasion,” Suga said.

The joint leaders’ statement included the first reference to Taiwan since 1969, before Tokyo normalized ties with Beijing, using similar phrasing by the foreign and defense ministers of both countries after a meeting last month.

Attention had been focused on the wording on Taiwan and other sensitive issues, given caution in Tokyo about the need to balance its security concerns with Japan’s deep economic ties with China.

DIGITAL COMPETITIVENESS, HUMAN RIGHTS

Taiwan’s government welcomed the show of support, and called on China to act responsibly.

“We hope the Beijing authorities will fulfill their responsibilities as part of the Taiwan Strait and region and jointly make positive contributions to stability and well being,” presidential office spokesman Xavier Chang said in a statement.

In another swipe at China, Biden told the news conference the United States and Japan will invest together in areas such as 5G, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, genomics and semiconductor supply chains.

The joint statement said the United States had committed $2.5 billion and Japan $2 billion to strengthen digital competitiveness including in 5G and beyond 5G networks.

“Japan and the United States are both deeply invested in innovation and looking to the future,” Biden said. “That includes making sure we invest in and protect technologies that will maintain and sharpen our competitive edge.”

Speaking later to a Washington think tank, Suga said Japan would say what is needed to be said to China and speak up on human rights, while also stressing the need to establish a stable, constructive relationship with Beijing.

The leaders’ statement said they “share serious concerns” about the human rights situation in Hong Kong and China’s Xinjiang region, where Washington has said Beijing is perpetrating a genocide against Muslim Uighurs. China has denied abuses.

Japan has been criticized for not taking stronger action on alleged human rights abuses for fear of a backlash that could hurt its firms with business in China, its biggest trade partner.

At the White House news conference, Suga said he told Biden that he was committed to moving forward with the summer Olympic Games in Japan and that Biden offered his support. Japan is grappling with rising coronavirus infections with fewer than 100 days until the planned start.

“I told the president about my determination to realize the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic games this summer as a symbol of global unity,” Suga said.

As they sat down for talks, Biden, Suga and their two delegations all wore masks, in keeping with protocols to protect against the spread of COVID-19.

Biden appeared determined to get off on the right foot with Suga after four years in which Trump sometimes chastised allies in Asia and elsewhere over what he saw as insufficient defense spending or funding for U.S. troop presence and questioned the value of bedrock military alliances.

With the Suga meeting and another planned summit with South Korea in May, Biden hopes to energize joint efforts with Australia, India and Japan in a grouping known as the Quad, as well as with South Korea, to counter China and longtime U.S. foe North Korea.

How do they expect us to pay this? We could sell off every team and it still wouldn’t even come close. They didn’t even warn us either, they acted like it was no big deal and then they slam us with this bill just because 7,200 of these people were out of network.

Samarra (Iraq) (AFP)

Five rockets targeted an Iraqi airbase hosting US soldiers Sunday, wounding two foreign contractors and three Iraqi soldiers, in the latest attack coinciding with tensions between Baghdad's allies Tehran and Washington.

Two of the rockets fired at Balad airbase, north of Baghdad, crashed into a dormitory and a canteen of US company Sallyport, a security source told AFP.

Two foreign contractors and three Iraqi soldiers were wounded, the source added.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the United States routinely blames Iran-linked Iraqi factions for such attacks on its troops and diplomats.

F-16 fighters are stationed at the Balad airbase, and several maintenance companies are present there, employing Iraqi and foreign staff.

There have been around 20 bomb or rocket attacks against American interests, including bases hosting US soldiers, since US President Joe Biden took office in January.

Dozens of others took place from the autumn of 2019 under the administration of Donald Trump.

Two Americans and an Iraqi civilian have been killed in such attacks since late 2019.

An Iraqi civilian working for a firm maintaining US fighter jets for the Iraq airforce was also wounded in one attack.

The Balad base was also targeted earlier this month, without causing any casualties.

The attacks are sometimes claimed by shadowy Shiite armed groups aligned with Iran who are demanding the Biden administration set a pullout date for Iraq as it has for Afghanistan.

On Wednesday, an explosives-packed drone slammed into Iraq's Arbil airport in the first reported use of such a weapon against a base used by US-led coalition troops in the country, officials said.

There were no casualties in the strike on the capital of northern Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region, although it did cause damage to a building in the military part of the airport.

In February, more than a dozen rockets targeted the military complex inside the same airport, killing an Iraqi civilian and a foreign contractor working with US-led troops.

Pro-Iran groups have been ratcheting up their rhetoric, vowing to ramp up attacks to force out the ""occupying"" US forces, and there have been almost daily attacks on coalition supply convoys across the mainly Shiite south.

The United States last week committed to withdraw all remaining combat forces from Iraq, although the two countries did not set a timeline for what would be a second US withdrawal since the 2003 invasion which toppled Saddam Hussein.

- Sworn foes -

The announcement came as the Biden administration resumed a ""strategic dialogue"" with the government of Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi, who is seen as too close to Washington by pro-Iranian groups.

Biden last week announced a full US pullout from Afghanistan by the 20th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks that also led to the US-led invasion of Saddam Hussein's Iraq three years later.

Sworn foes Tehran and Washington have both since had a presence in Iraq, where 2,500 US troops are still deployed and Iran sponsors the Hashed al-Shaabi, a state-integrated paramilitary coalition.

Tensions have spiked to the edge of war, in particular after Trump ordered a drone strike near Baghdad airport in January 2020 that killed top Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani.

0,Russian Security Service Detains Ukraine Diplomat.,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/04/17/russian-security-service-detains-ukraine-diplomat-a73632,"Russia on Saturday said it would expel a Ukrainian diplomat, prompting an immediate pledge of retaliation from Kiev, further escalating tensions over Moscow's troop build-up on Ukraine's eastern flank.

The detention of a Ukrainian consul in the second city St. Petersburg comes at a time of global concern of a repeat of Moscow's 2014 aggression, when Russia annexed the peninsula of Crimea and backed separatists in Ukraine's east.

Moscow claimed the Ukrainian diplomat had been caught ""red-handed"" trying to obtain sensitive information.

In response, the Ukrainian foreign ministry protested ""the illegal"" detention of its diplomat and said Kiev would expel a senior Russian diplomat.

Kiev has been battling Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine since 2014 and clashes intensified early this year, effectively shredding a ceasefire agreed last July.

Around 30 Ukrainian troops have been killed since the start of the year, compared to 50 last year. Most of them were victims of sniper fire.

Russia has detained a number of Ukrainian nationals on suspicion of spying in recent years but the arrest of a diplomat is rare.

""A Ukrainian diplomat, a consul of Ukraine's Consulate General in St. Petersburg, Alexander Sosonyuk, has been detained by Russia's FSB,"" the security service said in a statement, using the Russian language spelling of his name.

He was held on Friday, the security service said. Kiev said the diplomat had spent several hours in detention.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said Saturday it had summoned Ukraine's charge d'affaires Vasyl Pokotylo and told him that the Ukrainian diplomat had 72 hours to leave the country ""beginning April 19.""

""The Russian side pointed to the inadmissibility of such kind of activity,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

Russia's domestic intelligence agency said Sosonyuk had been caught ""red-handed"" during a meeting with a Russian national as he sought to receive ""classified"" information.

""Such activity is not compatible with his diplomatic status and is clearly hostile in nature towards the Russian Federation,"" the FSB said.

""In conformity with international law, measures will be taken against the foreign diplomat.""

'Crude violations'

In Kiev, the Ukrainian foreign ministry said it protested the diplomat's detention and rejected Russia's accusations.

Foreign ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said Russia had ""crudely"" violated diplomatic conventions and sought to escalate tensions.

""In response to the above-mentioned provocation, a senior diplomat of the Russian Embassy in Kiev must leave Ukrainian territory within 72 hours beginning April 19,"" Nikolenko told AFP. He did not provide further details.

Faced with the largest deployment of Russian troops on Ukraine's borders since 2014, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has requested more help from the West, and Western leaders have urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop intimidating Ukraine.

Tensions between Russia and Ukraine come against the background of a new war of words between Moscow and Washington as new U.S. President Joe Biden seeks a tougher line against Putin.

The U.S. on Thursday announced sanctions and the expulsion of 10 Russian diplomats in retaliation for what the White House says is the Kremlin's U.S. election interference, a massive cyber attack and other hostile activity.

Russia said Friday it would expel U.S. diplomats and sanction U.S. officials in response while recommending the U.S. envoy leave Russia ""for consultations.""",534,3517,6,50
0,Iran produces first batch of 60% enriched uranium,https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2021/04/16/649598/Iran-says-it-produced-first-batch-of-60-percent-enriched-uranium-products,"Iran’s scientists have managed to produce the country’s first batch of 60-percent enriched uranium in Natanz days after a nuclear facility came under a terrorist attack, top officials say.

""60-percent enrichment is currently underway at the Shahid Ahmadi Roshan nuclear facility"" in Natanz, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran Ali Akbar Salehi said Friday.

Salehi said any level of enrichment is now possible for Iran, adding despite the recent sabotage, enrichment continues at the Natanz facility.

He said the 60-percent enrichment was completed in two days. “Production of 60-percent enriched uranium is currently 9 grams per hour,” Salehi said.

The 20-percent enrichment which was already underway at the facility continues in parallel with the 60-percent enrichment, he said, adding ""the Natanz site is still standing and moving forward vigorously"".

""One of the deterrents is the readiness of our devout youth who immediately fix up the problem whenever the enemy creates an accident and move a few steps forward as well,” Salehi said.

The announcement came days after Iran informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of a plan to start 60-percent uranium enrichment, following what Iran called “nuclear terrorism” against Natanz.

“I am proud to announce that at 00:40 last night ... young and pious Iranian scientists were able to obtain a 60% enriched uranium product,” Parliament speaker Mohammad-Baqer Qalibaf wrote in a Persian tweet on Friday.

""We congratulate the brave people of the Islamic Iran on this success; the will of the Iranian people is miraculous and will thwart any conspiracy,"" he added.

The 60-percent uranium is used to make a variety of radiopharmaceuticals, which are hard to come by amid the most aggressive US sanctions ever on Iran.

Salehi said enrichment to 60-percent purity level has different applications, one of which for the production of radiopharmaceuticals.

The production is possible with 20-percent enrichement, but ""as the richness increases, our efficiency increases and the amount of molybdenum also increases, while the production time becomes shorter and the process easier"", he added.

Molybdenum has many civilian uses including in medical imaging. It is also used as a catalyst in the refining of petroleum and an alloying agent in steel.

The act of sabotage came a day after Iran began feeding gas to cascades of new, advanced centrifuges and unveiled 133 achievements to mark its national nuclear technology day.

Iranian officials have said while the aim of the attack was apparently to limit Iran's nuclear capability, all the centrifuges that went out of order due to the incident were of the IR1 type that are being replaced with more advanced ones.

On Saturday, an order was given to feed gas to 164 all-Iranian IR6 centrifuges, with 10 SWU – separative work units that indicate the amount of separation done by an enrichment process.

The IR6 is the most sustainably efficient centrifuge Iran currently deploys, which will be mass-produced on an industrial level. The machine is able to produce 10 times more uranium hexafluoride (UF6) than IR1, Iran’s first-generation centrifuges.

Presiden Hassan Rouhani also gave the order to begin feeding gas to test a number of 30 IR5 centrifuges and 30 IR6s centrifuges, numbers that could grow if they are successful.

Moreover, mechanical tests began on the top-of-the-line IR9 centrifuge that has a separative capacity of 50 SWU.

Also in Natanz, a unit to assemble and evaluate advanced centrifuges was launched, where Iranian experts said more than half of all operations are currently industrialized.

Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has said the perpetrators of the sabotage are wrong to think the act will undermine Iran’s position in Vienna negotiations which are held with the aim of lifting US sanctions on the Islamic Republic.

“Incidentally, this cowardly act will strengthen our position in the negotiations,” Zarif said on Monday.

Both the US and the Europeans have kept silent on the attack, and expressed concerns over Iran's 60-percent enrichment, instead. The Europeans are one of the interlocutors in the Vienna talks - while the US is not because it is no longer a party to the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.

In a surprise move, the European Union on Monday imposed sanctions on eight Iranians, including head of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), raising the ante in hostile measures against Tehran.

Iran's chief negotiator Abbas Araqchi told Press TV on Thursday that the EU sanctions are meant to undermine the negotiations.

“The Europeans not only ignored this important act of sabotage, but also they were busy imposing new sanctions on Iran and that was totally unacceptable,” he said in Vienna.

Araqchi said participants at a Thursday session had “very tough exchanges of views”, but they all agreed to move forward.

“They have to lift all sanctions and we need the list of sanctions and this should be our job in this round of discussion,” he said of the US sanctions on Iran, asserting that without a list, “I don’t think we can make any progress.”

The list should also include the third parties which have been sanctioned because of their cooperation with Iran, Araqchi said.

“Before we see the list, we cannot judge whether it is as complete as we want or not.”

On Wednesday, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei warned against ""attritive negotiations"", saying protracted talks are harmful to Iran.",884,5517,8,49
0,Australian federal police have launched a fresh investigation into former soldier Ben Roberts-Smith after it was alleged he buried sensitive material in his backyard and attempted to intimidate a witness in an active investigation into war crimes.,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/apr/14/australian-federal-police-investigating-fresh-allegations-against-ex-soldier-ben-roberts-smith,"The Australian federal police has launched a fresh investigation into former soldier Ben Roberts-Smith after it was alleged he buried sensitive material in his backyard and attempted to intimidate a witness in an active investigation into war crimes.

The AFP deputy commissioner, Ian McCartney, told a Senate estimates hearing on Wednesday that police had opened an investigation into the new allegations.

The Nine Network has alleged that Roberts-Smith buried – in a child’s lunchbox in his backyard – USB sticks containing classified information including operational reports from an SAS mission in southern Afghanistan, drone footage and photos.

The Nine report also alleged Roberts-Smith, a winner of the Victoria Cross, sent emails and letters intimidating people he believed would give evidence against him to war crimes investigators.

Audio recordings published by Nine allegedly reveal Roberts-Smith speaking candidly about seeking retribution against politicians, journalists and other former soldiers who have opposed him.

“I’m going to do everything I can to fucking destroy them, mate … that’s my sole fucking mission in life,” he allegedly said.

McCartney confirmed: “The AFP has opened an investigation into aspects of that media reporting.” He declined to say whether the AFP was in possession of USB drives. “Given it’s an ongoing investigation we’d prefer not to provide a running commentary.”

McCartney would not confirm any of the particulars of the investigation but made the general observation that witness intimidation was a serious issue.

“Some of the allegations that have been raised are serious and it’s being treated as a priority by the Australian federal police,” he said.

Roberts-Smith, one of Australia’s most decorated soldiers, is suing the publishers of the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times over articles he says defamed him when reporting he was alleged to have committed war crimes in Afghanistan between 2009 and 2012.

Roberts-Smith has consistently denied all claims made against him. A statement issued on his behalf on Wednesday denied the new allegations.

“The allegations that he ‘hid’ or failed to disclose material to the inspector general of the ADF during the Afghanistan inquiry is false,” the statement said. “Mr Roberts-Smith fully cooperated with the Afghanistan inquiry.

“The allegations that he threatened any witnesses or potential witness to the inspector general … to stop them giving evidence is false. The allegations he buried USBs in his backyard is false. This simply did not happen.”

Arthur Moses, acting for Roberts-Smith, told a federal court directions hearing that the publication of the allegations ahead of the June defamation trial was an abuse of process.

“Eight weeks out from a trial, there is a concerted effort by the respondents to publish material prejudicial to the trial. That is an abuse – if they want to run the case then they should do it properly.”

The AFP has previously confirmed it was investigating allegations of war crimes committed by Australian soldiers in Afghanistan but has refused to confirm or deny specific incidents or identify who it was investigating.

A report last year by the inspector general of the Australian defence force, Paul Brereton, found credible evidence to support allegations Australian special forces troops were involved in the murder of 39 Afghan civilians, in some cases executing prisoners to “blood” junior soldiers before inventing cover stories and planting weapons on corpses.

Maj Gen Justice Paul Brereton described the special forces’ actions as a “disgraceful and a profound betrayal” of the ADF.",568,3661,37,247

The rare remains were discovered in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, according to a statement from Historic England, a public body that looks after the country's historic environment, published Thursday.

Archeologists were drafted in to work on the project because Iron Age and Roman remains had been found at the site, but the findings ""were far more significant than anticipated,"" said Historic England.

They include a circular central room with various rooms built off it, as well as a bath house. Archeologists believe the large complex of buildings could have been a luxury villa, a religious sanctuary or a mixture of both.

The remains will be preserved in an open public space on the new housing development. MAP Archaeological Practice

""These archaeological remains are a fantastic find and are far more than we ever dreamed of discovering at this site,"" said Keith Emerick, inspector of ancient monuments at Historic England. ""They are already giving us a better knowledge and understanding of Roman Britain.""

0,Qatar stocks soar on plan to allow full foreign ownership,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/15/qatar-stocks-soar-on-plan-to-allow-full-foreign-ownership,"Qatari stocks jumped the most in a year after the country said it could allow foreign investors to fully own listed firms – a move that could trigger nearly $1.5bn in inflow.

Qatari stocks rose the most in a year after the country said it may allow foreign investors to fully own listed companies, a move that could trigger more than $1 billion of overseas inflows.

The cabinet approved a draft law that will allow overseas investors to own up to 100% of listed companies, according to the state-run Qatar News Agency. If the law is implemented, companies would have to individually approve the increased limit.

While implementation is yet to be confirmed, the decision could trigger inflows of about $1.5 billion into listed companies that would earn bigger representation in global benchmarks, according to estimates by investment bank EFG-Hermes. The QE Index gained 2.8% Thursday, the most in more than a year, to close at the highest level since Jan. 14.

Stocks that could benefit the most include Qatar Islamic Bank SAQ, Masraf Al Rayan QSC and the Commercial Bank of Qatar, the investment bank said. Their shares climbed 8.3%, 5.5% and 10% on Thursday, respectively, leading gains among members of the main gauge.

The gas-rich nation is following similar decisions by other Gulf countries as they seek to attract inflows from abroad. In 2019, the United Arab Emirates said it would allow foreigners to own 100% of businesses across industries and Saudi Arabia removed a cap on ownership of publicly traded companies for foreign strategic investors.

The proposal is “another milestone on the path to liberalising the economy, with Qatar setting the foreign ownership standard for the region,” said Akber Khan, senior director of asset management at Al Rayan Investment in Doha.

The ministers also announced the extension of pandemic-prompted financial support for private businesses, particularly the extension of a guarantee program that allowed some companies to borrow money interest-free to pay salaries and rent through the end of September. Restaurants, salons and other recreational venues closed earlier this month as the country tightened restrictions to combat a second wave of the coronavirus.

“With the loan-deferral program extending further, businesses will have more time to improve cash flow before lenders assess the ability of customers to pay down deferred dues and it allows for more loan restructuring,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Edmond Christou. Qatari banks have relatively low ratios of non-performing loans, but data on first-quarter earnings suggests they’ve edged higher, he added.

REUTERS/Stringer TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY - RC22VM9Y10NU

France has advised French citizens to temporarily leave Pakistan and warned of serious threats to French interests in the country, two diplomatic sources said on Thursday, after violent clashes there this week.

Thousands of Pakistani Islamists had clashed with police earlier this week in protest against the arrest of their leader ahead of rallies denouncing French cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammad.

For Muslims, depictions of the Prophet are blasphemous.

The diplomatic sources said that a message had been sent overnight to French citizens and companies following threats by hardline Islamist group Tehrik-i-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) to target French interests.

The sources said the embassy sent a message to French residents in Pakistan recommending that French nationals leave the country and French companies shut down activities temporarily ""due to the serious threats to French interests in Pakistan"".

Relations between Paris and Islamabad have worsened since the end of last year after President Emmanuel Macron paid tribute to a French history teacher who was beheaded by an 18-year-old man of Chechen origin for showing cartoons of the Prophet in a class on freedom of speech.

The images sparked anger and protests in the Muslim world, especially in Pakistan, and even saw a Pakistani minister forced to withdraw comments she made that Macron was treating Muslims like Nazis had treated Jews in World War Two.

Last year, TLP ended a similar protest against France only after the government signed a deal agreeing to endorse a boycott of French products and making a move in parliament to expel French ambassador. It had this week demanded the envoy be expelled.

Pakistan has said it would outlaw the group and the arrest of its leader this week sparked further protests against France.

""It's a serious situation and we know that in Pakistan things can escalate quickly,"" said one of the diplomatic sources.

It is now readily available online.

Keeping their identities anonymous, the hackers have sent emails to Navalny's supporters, threatening to use their email addresses to gather extra information, before eventually selling the database to advertising companies. The leaked file contains 529,570 different addresses, although many of them have not been verified.

The website, set up on March 23, aims to collect information about 500,000 Navalny backers, with the aim of mobilizing an extensive database once they hit the figure. To sign up, a supporter just needs to enter their location, which can be either their house or street, and an email address. Once the email is confirmed, the person is placed on an interactive map, which currently has 440,217 people.

The initiative, set up by Navalny's right-hand man, Lithuania-based Leonid Volkov, seeks to show the authorities that a considerable number of Russians are behind the opposition figure. The hackers, however, aren't very happy about the idea.

""Keep participating in the movement of this IT wizz Volkov, and we'll keep getting new data about you, haha,"" the email, sent to the entire database, cajoled. ""In the meantime, we'll start de-anonymizing emails, and soon we'll know your names, addresses, phone numbers. Next, we'll sell your data to advertising companies.""

Ivan Zhdanov, director of Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, confirmed the hack as real, but assured those on the database that their only listed data is their email address. The Anti-Corruption Foundation is listed by the Ministry of Justice as a Foreign Agent.

Writing on the Team Navalny telegram channel, Zhdanov suggested that the issue lies with the third-party service used to send out communications.

""The biggest mean thing malicious users can do is to send you a nasty email, which will probably end up in spam,"" he said. ""We apologize for the trouble caused.""

This is not the first time Navalny supporters have had their information exposed online. In February, Moscow daily Kommersant wrote that an archive of personal information about 28,000 people was leaked on the web, including telephone numbers.

The opposition figure is currently in prison after being judged to have broken the terms of a suspended sentence, handed to him in 2014 due to a case involving French company Yves Rocher.

Opponents of Myanmar's junta on Friday announced the formation of a national unity government, which includes ousted lawmakers, members of ethnic minority groups and figures in the anti-coup protest, according to a video statement read out on Public Voice Television.

The announcement was made on the Facebook page of the opposition Public Voice Television, which posted a video statement by veteran Myanmar democracy activist, Min Ko Naing.

""Please welcome the people's government,"" said Min Ko Naing said in a 10-address in Burmese.

A second post named the heads of 15 senior posts in the national unity administration with the country's deposed president, U Win Myint, and detained opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi retaining their pre-coup posts.

It also named heads of various ministries in opposition, from defence and home affairs (interior ministry) to a ""ministry of international cooperation"".

In a Twitter post, the unity government's minister of international cooperation, Dr Sasa, who goes by one name, said he had ""humbly accepted"" the responsibility of his new post.

Statement by Dr. Sasa

I am proud to have been asked to serve as the Union Minister of International Cooperation and as Spokesperson for the National Unity Government of Myanmar . I have humbly accepted this responsibility.

We will prevail pic.twitter.com/xP0pCBz48t — Dr. Sasa (@DrSasa22222) April 16, 2021

In his address, Min Ko Naing said the will of the people was the unity government's priority, while acknowledging the scale of the task at hand.

""We're trying to get this out from the roots so we have to sacrifice a lot,"" he said, referring to the junta.

An unhappy union

The February 1 coup in Myanmar has opened an unexpected window of opportunity for the various ethnic rebel outfits, which have no loyalty to either the junta or to Suu Kyi to unite in opposition to the army's rule.

>> Read more: Myanmar ethnic groups unite in fight against army

Stretching from the tropical coastal lowlands of the Bay of Bengal to temperate mountain ranges bordering China, Myanmar is one of the world’s most ethnically diverse countries. But the dominant Bamar ethnic group has long marginalised minority ethnic groups, many of them based in border ares.

Myanmar has 133 officially recognised minority ethnic groups – as well as other groups, such as the Rohingyas, that are not officially recognised.

For many ethnic minorities, Suu Kyi's administration has been more foe than friend.

While each ethnic armed group has its own demands, all want a version of federalism, giving them at least some measure of self-governance.

Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy (NLD) once offered them that in exchange for electoral support, but ethnic community leaders say little came of it.

""The Bamar majority have given such a promise from time to time, without it materialising,"" Khu Oo Reh of the Karenni National Progressive Party (KNPP), told AFP.

Silent strike

While the politicians were announcing the unity government, other opponents of military rule observed a ""silent strike"" staying home to mourn those killed or wearing black in small marches in several cities and towns.

Streets in the main city of Yangon were largely deserted, residents said, while black-clad protesters held small rallies in half a dozen cities and towns, media reported.

There were no immediate reports of violence but overnight, two people were shot and killed in the central town of Myingyan, Radio Free Asia reported.

The military has also been rounding up its critics and has published the names of more than 200 people wanted under a law that makes it illegal to encourage mutiny or dereliction of duty in the armed forces.

Two prominent protest organisers were arrested on Thursday along with an actor and singer, both known for speaking out against the coup.

In another show of defiance, a previously unknown group called the Ayeyarwaddy Federal Army said on Facebook it aimed to fight the military to restore an elected government and protect the people and it called for volunteers.

It gave no details about how it aimed to take on the well-equipped and experienced army.

The turmoil has alarmed Myanmar's neighbours in Southeast Asia, who have been trying to encourage talks between the rival sides.

Southeast Asian leaders will meet in Indonesia on April 24 to discuss the situation, Thai and Indonesian media reported. Junta leader Senior General Min Aung Hlaing was due to attend, a Thai broadcaster said, but the Jakarta Post said it had not been confirmed whether the summit would include representatives of the junta or the former government.

Sasa however said ASEAN should not invite ""murderer-in-chief"" Min Aung Hlaing to the summit.

1,Colorado Temporarily Re-Bans Marijuana For Statewide Tolerance Break,https://www.theonion.com/colorado-temporarily-re-bans-marijuana-for-statewide-to-1846644038,"DENVER—Reminding residents of a time when a single joint was all it took to get a nice buzz going, Colorado officials announced Thursday that, effective immediately, they would temporarily re-ban marijuana as part of a statewide mandatory tolerance break. “After nearly a decade of legalized recreational use, we are instituting a 21-day ban on the sale and possession of cannabis so we can all cool off, reset, and reverse the diminishing effects that we as a state have experienced,” said Gov. Jared Polis, who added that in a recent marijuana-use survey, 78% of state residents mentioned they were considering taking a break anyway, having noticed lately that it took two or three bowls before they even felt anything. “Many Coloradans are now burning through half their stash just to get in the right mindset for the day, and we’re reaching a point at which primo weed is something we merely take for granted rather than something we truly appreciate and enjoy. The simple pleasure of lighting up with some friends has fallen by the wayside, and despite rotating strains, mixing in edibles, and venturing into the world of waxes and dabs, it’s obvious our state is not getting that fun, heady high we used to get back when pot was first legalized. Plus, when Colorado residents hang out with new users from Virginia or Illinois, it’s embarrassing to have to get a huge head start just to wind up on the same level as everyone else.” At press time, Coloradans who suddenly found themselves unable to purchase weed were reportedly upset, having scraped out their smoking devices and found there wasn’t enough resin left to get anything more than a headache.",281,1659,8,68
0,China ramps up vaccination drive with free eggs for those getting jab,https://www.euronews.com/2021/04/16/china-ramps-up-vaccination-drive-with-free-eggs-for-those-getting-jab?utm_source=flipboard.com&amp;utm_campaign=feeds_news&amp;utm_medium=referral,"China's success at controlling the coronavirus outbreak has resulted in a population that has seemed almost reluctant to get vaccinated.

The country is accelerating its inoculation campaign by offering incentives — free eggs, shop coupons and discounts on groceries and merchandise — to those getting a jab.

After a slow start, China is now giving millions of vaccines a day. A top government doctor, Zhong Nanshan, announced a June goal of vaccinating 560 million of the country’s 1.4 billion people.

The challenge lies partly in the sheer scale of the effort and the need to convince a population that currently feels safe from infections.

When patients first showed up at hospitals in Wuhan in late 2019 with fevers, coughs and breathing difficulties, the government locked down the city and others in Hubei province for more than two months starting in January 2020. Wuhan later became known as the epicentre of the outbreak.

Since then, China has controlled the virus through stringent border controls and quick lockdowns whenever new outbreaks crop up.

People can dine out in restaurants and the risk of infection is low, so many don't seem to be in a hurry to get the vaccine.

But China also wants to open up as the world seeks to return to pre-pandemic normalcy and Beijing readies to welcome tens of thousands of visitors as host of the Winter Olympics in February 2022.

For now, in major cities like Shanghai and Beijing, the government has relied mostly on sustained messaging and freebies to convince people to get vaccinated.

Shopping malls have offered points at stores or coupons. A temple in Beijing offered free entry to anyone showing proof of vaccination. Shanghai is using buses in its campaign to set up mobile vaccination points.

And then there are the free eggs. “Good news. Starting from today, residents 60-years-old and above who have got their first shot are eligible for five ‘jin’ (2.5 kilograms or 5 1/2 pounds) of eggs. First come, first served,” said a poster by a city-run health centre in Beijing.

Some people have expressed doubts about how good the existing vaccines are given how quickly they were developed.

The five vaccines currently being used in China have an efficacy range of 50.7% to 79.3%, based on what the companies that developed them have said.

But the effectiveness of a Sinovac vaccine at preventing symptomatic infections was found to be as low as 50.4% by researchers in Brazil, near the 50% threshold at which health experts say a vaccine is useful. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been found to be 97% effective.

`The threshold needed for regulatory approval by the World Health Organization (WHO) is also 50%.

Herd immunity only occurs when enough of the population has immunity, either from vaccinations or past infection, to stop the uncontrolled spread of an infectious disease.

China may need to vaccinate at least 1 billion people to achieve that, said Wang Huaqing, a top immunology official with China’s Center for Disease Control, in an interview with state media this week.

As of early April, roughly 34 million people had received two shots and about 65 million got one dose.

Gao Fu, the head of the CDC, said last weekend that China is considering various strategies such as mixing different vaccines to try to increase effectiveness. Outside experts say China could eventually deploy other, more effective vaccines, such as the Pfizer or Moderna shots.

Chinese drugmaker Fosun Pharmaceutical Group has partnered with Germany's BioNTech to sell the Pfizer vaccine in China. However, it has only been approved in Hong Kong and Macao, special territories in China with their own regulatory agencies. A clinical trial for mainland approval is underway.

Vaccination is supposed to be voluntary, but overzealous efforts by some local governments and companies prompted health officials to issue a warning this week against forced vaccinations.

A hospital in Danzhou on the southern island province of Hainan issued an apology after it issued a notice to staff saying: “Those who are not vaccinated could be fired.”

In Zhejiang province, an April 2 announcement said all government departments, Communist Party cadres and people working in universities would be required to take the lead in getting shots.

The national government also required vaccination for all residents in Ruili, a border town with Myanmar, because of a recent outbreak.",721,4426,12,69
0,Europe eyes strict rules for artificial intelligence,https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-strict-rules-artificial-intelligence/,"The rules carve out an exception allowing authorities to use the tech if they're fighting serious crime | Image via iStock

Press play to listen to this article Voiced by Amazon Polly

No HAL 9000s or Ultrons on this continent, thank you very much.

The European Union wants to avoid the worst of what artificial intelligence can do — think creepy facial recognition tech and many, many Black Mirror episodes — while still trying to boost its potential for the economy in general.

According to a draft of its upcoming rules, obtained by POLITICO, the European Commission would ban certain uses of ""high-risk"" artificial intelligence systems altogether, and limit others from entering the bloc if they don't meet its standards. Companies that don't comply could be fined up to €20 million or 4 percent of their turnover. The Commission will unveil its final regulation on April 21.

The rules are the first of their kind to regulate artificial intelligence, and the EU is keen to highlight its unique approach. It doesn't want to leave powerful tech companies to their own devices like in the U.S., nor does it want to go by the way of China in harnessing the tech to fashion a surveillance state. Instead, the bloc says it wants a ""human-centric"" approach that both boosts the tech, but also keeps it from threatening its strict privacy laws.

That means AI systems that streamline manufacturing, model climate change, or make the energy grid more efficient would be welcome. But many technologies currently in use in Europe today, such as algorithms used to scan CVs, make creditworthiness assessments, hand out social security benefits or asylum and visa applications, or help judges make decisions, would be labeled as ""high risk,"" and would be subject to extra scrutiny.

Checks and balances

Social scoring systems, such as those launched in China that track the trustworthiness of people and businesses, are classified as ""contravening the Union values"" and are going to be banned.

The proposal also wants to prohibit AI systems that cause harm to people by manipulating their behavior, opinions or decisions; exploit or target people's vulnerabilities; and for mass surveillance.

But the rules carve out an exception allowing authorities to use the tech if they're fighting serious crime. The use of facial recognition technology in public places, for example, could be allowed if its use is limited in time and geography. The Commission said it would allow for exceptional cases in which law enforcement officers could use facial recognition technology from CCTV cameras to find terrorists, for example.

The exception is likely designed to appease countries like France, which is keen to integrate AI into its security apparatus, but is opposed by privacy hawks and digital rights activists who have lobbied hard for these uses to be banned outright.

“Giving discretion to national authorities to decide which use cases to permit or not simply recreates the loopholes and grey areas that we already have under current legislation and which have led to widespread harm and abuse,” said Ella Jakubowska of digital rights group EDRi.

The EU is also keen to avoid issues of racial and gender bias, which have plagued the development of the technology from its inception. One of the Commission’s requirements in the draft are that data sets do not “incorporate any intentional or unintentional biases” which may lead to discrimination.

The draft also proposes creating a European Artificial Intelligence Board, comprising one representative per EU country, the EU's data protection authority, and a European Commission representative. The board will supervise the law’s application and share best practices.

Transatlantic tensions

Industry is likely to take issue with the stringent rules, which they say would make the EU market less appealing and encourage European innovators to launch elsewhere.

The strict rules could also put the EU in the crosshairs of its allies. The U.S., which is far more concerned about countering China, and whose companies are likely to be subject to the regulation, is likely to have preferred a looser bill. Surveillance remains one of Europe's key sticking points when it comes to transatlantic collaboration with the U.S.

In an interview with POLITICO in March, Eric Schmidt, Google's former chief and chair of the U.S. National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI), said Europe's strategy won't be successful, as it is ""simply not big enough"" to compete.

""Europe will need to partner with the United States on these key platforms,” Schmidt said, referring to American big tech companies which dominate the development of AI technologies.

""Hydrogen has great potential to emerge as a future source of energy,"" he said. ""The enthusiasm about hydrogen has a simple reason -- whether it's used in a fuel cell or burned to create heat, wherever hydrogen replaces fossil fuels, it slows global warming.""Carbon-free hydrogen can be produced from fossils fuels, such as natural gas or coal, by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using a current of electricity. Hydrogen thus generated can be used as a transport fuel.However, hydrogen supply and distribution in India face challenges such as high production costs and complimentary infrastructure requirements.Speaking at a roundtable on hydrogen economy, Pradhan said the government is ""committed to augmenting the hydrogen supply chain infrastructure in the country"", including integrating it with flagship programs like SATAT that generates compressed biogas from municipal and agri waste.Stating that work was on pilot projects to produce blue hydrogen (from fossil fuels) and green hydrogen (from renewable sources), he said hydrogen was being blended with compressed natural gas (CNG) for use as a transportation fuel as well as an industrial input to refineries.""Fifty buses in Delhi are plying on CNG blended with hydrogen on a pilot basis. We plan to scale it up in the coming months across the major cities of India,"" he said.Pradhan further said various initiatives for the greater use of hydrogen in India's energy mix are being taken, including the recent budget announcement of a National Hydrogen Mission for making a hydrogen roadmap for the country.Indian refineries, he said, are planning to leverage the available surplus hydrogen capacities for meeting the initial demand in mainstreaming hydrogen.One of such projects is underway at Gujarat refinery of Indian Oil wherein the combination of hydrogen production through natural gas and its hyphenation with the carbon capture technology will result in the production of blue hydrogen.Multiple buses powered by fuel cells will be covering various iconic routes.""Efforts are underway to leverage the vast CNG pipeline infrastructure to reduce the transportation cost of hydrogen,"" he said.Stating that global efforts are focused on finding ways to develop a hydrogen economy, he said the contours of India's energy transition roadmap include the development of emerging fuels, particularly hydrogen.""Energy is integral to support our fast-growing economy. We are developing an energy sector which will be growth-centric, industry-friendly and environment-conscious,"" he said. ""This requires ample access to affordable energy to improve the lives of Indians coupled with the need to have a smaller carbon footprint.""The inclusion of hydrogen as an energy carrier in the future energy portfolio presents a unique opportunity to address emerging energy sectors, including power to gas, power to power, and power to mobility and even vehicle to grid applications, he said.""India remains committed to environmental and climate causes with a massive thrust on deploying renewable energy and energy efficiency measures,"" he said, adding India's renewable power portfolio has grown from 32 GW to almost 100 GW in the last six years.India is targeting 450 GW of renewable energy generating capacity by 2030.""Diversification of our energy basket would be the key lever enabling energy transition,"" he said. ""However, it is equally important that the new energy-mix options synergize and co-exist with the established base technology already operational in the respective countries, in which huge capital investments have been made.""The role of hydrogen as a chemical is well known. ""We all now recognize the importance of hydrogen as an energy carrier and efforts are underway to devise ways to harness it in a reliable, cost-effective and safe manner.""""My Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, with a mandate of keeping the energy pipeline flowing, is committed to augmenting the hydrogen supply chain infrastructure in the country. Presently, as in the case of other countries, our petroleum sector is the largest producer of hydrogen for various refinery process operations.""Hence, we realize petroleum sector's capability to produce hydrogen molecules, stored and traded as gas, making it a natural votary of this new energy form,"" he said.The utility of hydrogen is not going to be limited only to the transport sector. ""The maturity of the ecosystem can be accelerated through its usage as a decarbonizing agent for a range of sectors, including industry covering chemicals, iron, steel, fertilizer and refining, transport, heat (domestic and industrial) and power,"" he said.By establishing synergies with natural gas, hydrogen can be easily adopted in the energy mix without seeking major infrastructural overhauling, he said.

Oof. This is obviously a big drag for everyone who was hoping that we could finally break the cursed ties that bind us and give birth to a beautiful child!

We were as thrilled as anybody in June of 2019 when Nintendo first announced Hyrule Warriors: Age Of Calamity at a Nintendo Direct event. Unfortunately, though, after traveling deep in the woods to the hovel where we first crossed paths with Glynwynda Of The Fens that fateful day, she shoved her bony finger in our faces and confirmed with devilish glee that since the game exists in a separate universe it can’t strictly be considered canon.

We have to admit, we were pretty blindsided by this, readers. Obviously, we’d never try to claim something like Super Smash Bros counted as a Zelda game because it contains characters from the series, or even that the Phillips-developed CD entries like Zelda: The Faces Of Evil and Zelda: The Wand Of Gamelon should be included, but at this point, we can’t help but feeling like the miserable crone is being a real stickler.

Yes, it’s pretty disappointing, especially since we have always dreamed of giving birth to a beautiful baby girl, and now it looks like our dream will never come true. The only real good news is that Age Of Calamity seems pretty fun. It’s got all the classic characters, settings, and objects Zelda fans will love—although it doesn’t have any of the signature puzzles or dungeons that would finally fulfill the terms of the magical bargain and give our mother the grandchild she so desperately wants. On the whole, it looks like a fun and creative way to keep us from thinking about the youthful hubris that led us to mock a wizened old hag for getting killed in the first level of the NES’ Legend Of Zelda all those years ago.

All in all, Age Of Calamity has really whetted our appetite for the next official Zelda game. Here’s hoping Nintendo will be releasing the Breath Of The Wild sequel soon, or that we can locate the powerful enchanted Amulet of Rapacity to finally banish Glynwynda back to the depths of Hell!",402,2269,33,175
0,China’s Ant explores ways for Jack Ma to exit,https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-chinas-ant-explores-ways-jack-ma-exit-beijing-piles-pressure-sources-2021-04-17/,"Ant Group is exploring options for founder Jack Ma to divest his stake in the financial technology giant and give up control, as meetings with Chinese regulators signaled to the company that the move could help draw a line under Beijing's scrutiny of its business, according to a source familiar with regulators' thinking and two people with close ties to the company.

Reuters is for the first time reporting details of the latest round of meetings and the discussions about the future of Ma's control of Ant, exercised through a complicated structure of investment vehicles. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Ma had offered in a November meeting with regulators to hand over parts of Ant to the Chinese government. https://on.wsj.com/2QvkHbc

Officials from the central bank, People's Bank of China (PBOC), and financial regulator China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) held talks between January and March with Ma and Ant separately, where the possibility of the tycoon's exit from the company was discussed, according to accounts provided by the source familiar with the regulators' thinking and one of the sources with close ties to the company.

Ant denied that a divestment of Ma's stake was ever under consideration. ""Divestment of Mr. Ma's stake in Ant Group has never been the subject of discussions with anyone,"" an Ant spokesman said in a statement.

Reuters could not determine whether Ant and Ma would proceed with a divestment option, and if so, which one. The company hoped Ma's stake, which is worth billions of dollars, could be sold to existing investors in Ant or its e-commerce affiliate Alibaba Group Holding Ltd without involving any external entity, one of the sources with company ties said.

But the second source also with company connections said that during discussions with regulators, Ma was told that he would not be allowed to sell his stake to any entity or individual close to him, and would instead have to exit completely. Another option would be to transfer his stake to a Chinese investor affiliated with the state, the source said.

Any move would need Beijing's approval, both sources with knowledge of the company's thinking said.

The accounts provided by all the three sources are consistent in terms of the timeline for how discussions have evolved over the past few months. On the company side, one source said Ma met regulators more than once before the Chinese New Year, which was in early February. And the second source said Ant started working on options for Ma's possible exit about a couple of months ago. The source familiar with the regulators' thinking said Ant had told officials during a meeting sometime before mid-March that it was working on options.

The source familiar with the regulators' thinking has direct knowledge of conversations between Ant and officials, while one of the sources with company ties has been briefed on Ma's interactions with regulators and Ant's plans. The other one has direct knowledge of Ant's discussions about options. They requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.

The Ant spokesman did not provide any comments from Ma. Alibaba referred questions to Ant. Jack Ma's office did not respond to Reuters' request for comment made via Ant. The State Council Information Office, PBOC, and CBIRC, also did not respond to requests for comment.

The high-stakes discussions come amid a revamp of Ant and a broader regulatory clampdown on China's technology sector that was set in motion after Ma's public criticism of regulators in a speech in October last year.

Ma's exit could help clear the way for Ant to revive plans to go public, which stalled after the tycoon's speech, both sources proximate to the company said. Ant, which was about to raise an estimated $37 billion in what would have been the world's largest initial public offering, aborted plans the day after Ma's Nov. 2 meeting with regulators.

'TOO BIG FOR THEIR BRITCHES'

Since then Beijing has unleashed a series of investigations and new regulations that have not only reined in Ma's empire but also swept across the country's technology sector, including other high-profile, billionaire entrepreneurs.

For Ma, 56, who also founded Alibaba and once commanded cult-like reverence in China, the consequences have been particularly severe. The tycoon completely withdrew from the public eye for about three months and has continued to keep a low profile after a brief January appearance. read more

China's antitrust regulator fined Alibaba a record $2.75 billion on April 10 following an antimonopoly probe that found it had abused its dominant market position for several years. A couple of days later Ant was asked by the central bank to become a financial holding company, bringing it under the ambit of banking rules that it had managed to avoid so far and allowed it to grow rapidly. read more

""China still likes to promote its technology firms as global leaders just as long as they don't get too big for their britches,"" said Andrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research.

CONTROLLING STAKE

Although Ma had previously stepped down from corporate positions, he retains effective control over Ant and significant influence over Alibaba.

While he only owns a 10% stake in Ant, Ma exercises control over the company through related entities, according to Ant's IPO prospectus.

Hangzhou Yunbo, an investment vehicle for Ma, has control over two other entities that own a combined 50.5% stake of Ant, the prospectus shows. Yunbo can decide all matters related to Ant and exercise the combined voting power of the three entities, the prospectus shows.

Ma holds a 34% equity interest in Yunbo, the prospectus shows.

One of the sources with company ties said there's ""a big chance"" Ma would sell his equity interest in Yunbo to exit from Ant, ultimately paving the way for the fintech major to move closer to completing its revamp and reviving its listing.

Reuters could not reach Yunbo for comment. Ant did not provide a comment on behalf of Yunbo.

0,Pakistan blocks social media platforms amid protest crackdown.,https://dw.com/p/3s67P?maca=en-gk-volltext-newsstand-world-en-10745-xml-googlenews,"Pakistan placed a temporary ban on several social media websites on Friday.

Platforms that will be unavailable include Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp, YouTube and Telegram.

The Interior Ministry directed the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to block the platforms until 3 p.m. (11:00 GMT).

""Social media has been blocked for a few hours so that troublemakers can not use it during Friday prayers congregations,"" an official told dpa.

Why exactly has social media been blocked in Pakistan?

The block comes amid fears that activists belonging to the radical Islamist Tehreek-e-Labaik (TLP) group might use the technology to perpetuate violent protests that have shaken the country this week.

At least five people including two police officers have been killed, and nearly 600 injured. Around 200 of those are in critical condition.

The TLP has also been agitating against the arrest of its leader, Saad Rizvi, who initially called for the rallies.

Political parties, Islamist groups and militant organizations in Pakistan rely heavily on social media platforms to connect with their followers.

Experts slam 'unconstitutional' move

The block drew widespread criticism from officials and human rights advocates. ""This ban is against the fundamental rights enshrined in the constitution,"" Dr. Mehdi Hassan, the ex-chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, told DW. ""Instead of putting a ban on social media, the government should arrest all the top leadership of the extreme outfit [TLP] and prosecute them in the court of law.""

Islamabad-based analyst Amir Hussain echoed those sentiments, adding that the ban on social media could have wide-reaching consequences on millions of people and businesses, many of whom have become dependent on social media to earn an income.

""Imagine the ways Uber drivers would be affected. Think of the women who are working at home and marketing their businesses through social media,"" Hussain told DW, adding that thousands of Pakistanis living abroad also use social media to conduct phone calls, and will be cut off from their main lines of communication.

He called on the government to alternatively ""change state policy, put an end to hate materials, and take action against those who use religion for political purposes.""

Some analysts, however, have praised the ban. ""The ban is a wise decision,"" Afzal Ali Shigri, a prominent security expert and former inspector general of police, told DW. Without a social media ban, he said, TLP supporters could use the platforms to upload fake videos to inspire further unrest.

""It is a prudent decision but I hope that this decision will be for a short time,"" Shigri added.

TLP supportes launched protests over the publication of caricatures of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad

What is the dispute with France about?

The TLP has been organizing rallies to denounce the publication of cartoons in France depicting the Prophet Muhammad.

The demonstrations prompted the French Embassy in Pakistan to urge its nationals to leave the country temporarily.

Extra security personnel have been deployed to the French embassy, and additional shipping containers placed as fortifications around its outer wall.

Prime Minister Imran Khan's government has struggled to get TLP protests under control in recent years, but this week announced an outright ban against the group.

The TLP is known for holding days-long, violent road protests over blasphemy issues, causing major disruption within the country.

In the most recent protests, demonstrators blocked roads and streets, demanding that the government fulfill an earlier promise to expel the French ambassador by April 20.

William Amos, who has represented the Quebec district of Pontiac since 2015, appeared on the screens of his fellow lawmakers completely naked Wednesday. The pandemic has meant many Canadian lawmakers participate in sessions via video conference instead of in person.

A screenshot obtained by The Canadian Press shows Amos standing behind a desk between the Quebec and Canadian flags, his private parts hidden by what appears to be a mobile phone in one hand.

“This was an unfortunate error,″ Amos said in a statement sent by email. ”`My video was accidentally turned on as I was changing into my work clothes after going for a jog. I sincerely apologize to my colleagues in the House of Commons for this unintentional distraction. Obviously, it was an honest mistake and it won’t happen again.”

Claude DeBellefeuille, a legislator for the opposition Bloc Quebecois party, raised the incident in a point of order after question period, suggesting that parliamentary decorum requires male Parliament members to wear a jacket and tie — and a shirt, underwear and trousers.

Speaker Anthony Rota later thanked DeBellefeuille for her “observations” and clarified that while he had not seen anything, he checked with technicians and confirmed they saw something. He reminded lawmakers to always be vigilant when they are near a camera and microphone.

Amos, the parliamentary secretary to Industry Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne, was visible only to Parliament members and staffers on an internal video conference feed. Because he was not speaking, his image did not show up on the public feed.

Liberal Party colleague Mark Holland said Amos was “utterly mortified.” Holland said he was satisfied with the explanation from his colleague.

“I don’t think there was any ill intent. It’s certainly an unfortunate circumstance,″ Holland said.

“This is a warning to everybody,"" Holland added. ""You’ve got to really always assume that camera is on and be very careful any time you wander anywhere near that camera that you’re dressed appropriately.″

This effectively closes the Ukrainian ports of Mariupol and Berdyansk to traffic,https://interfax.com.ua/news/general/737914.html,"Министерство иностранных дел Украины выражает решительный протест в связи с объявлением РФ о закрытии со следующей недели до октября 2021 года части акваторий Черного моря в направлении Керченского пролива для военных кораблей и государственных судов других стран под предлогом военных учений, и требует немедленно отменить решение о незаконном закрытии отдельных акваторий Черного моря.

""Такие действия Российской Федерации являются очередной попыткой в нарушение норм и принципов международного права узурпировать суверенные права Украины как прибрежного государства, поскольку именно Украина обладает правами регулировать судоходство в этих акваториях Черного моря"", - говорится в заявлении МИД Украины, обнародованном в четверг.

Министерство призвало международных партнеров усилить политико-дипломатическое давление на государство-агрессора с целью отмены решения о закрытии акватории и прекращения эскалации в Азово-Черноморском регионе.

""Также этот шаг является грубым нарушением права на свободу судоходства, гарантированного Конвенцией ООН по морскому праву.

Она перебрасывает военные корабли с Каспийского моря и усиливает свой военный потенциал в Азово-Черноморском регионе, а также, несмотря на отсутствие правовых оснований, решила закрыть эту акваторию для военных кораблей других государств, в частности Украины.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told Breakfast she was looking forward to seeing family and friends reunited as the transtasman bubble opens today.

Today 2000 New Zealanders would head off shore and 3000 would arrive in the country.

""That's really positive for us as we really want the inward flow to stimulate the economy.""

Ardern expected family and friends would be the first to make the most of the new bubble rules but that tourism would follow after.

From July to September New Zealand was expecting an influx of Aussies arriving in the South Island for skiing and expected Australian tourism to back to 80 per cent by the beginning of 2022.

Ardern thanked Kiwis for following the rules and making the ""unique"" arrangement between Australia and New Zealand possible.

While New Zealand was still focussed in opening up quarantine travel to the Cook Islands in May, she said there were ways to mitigate and concerns New Zealand had if for example Australia opened up its bubble to Singapore.

A date for the Cook Islands travel bubble had yet to be set and the Cook Islands were currently setting up and training staff around its PCR testing as this was needed before it commenced, she said.

Ardern said Singapore and Fiji were also keen to join New Zealand's travel bubble, but New Zealand would be a ""bit more cautious"" before going to Singapore.

She told RNZ it was a big day for New Zealand, but warned there would be ""ups and downs"" in the travel free the quarantine-free arrangement.

If New Zealand was worried about Australia opening up to Singapore then it could require anyone who had travelled outside Australia to stay in Australia for a period of time before travelling to New Zealand.

""Our base line to get as many NZers vaccinated before opening up to high-risk countries.""

While early research showed the chances of passing on Covid-19 once vaccinated was low, Ardern said there still needs to be more data to confirm that.

Ardern told the AM Show they would stop flights if they were concerned about a case not having an origin.

Ardern said she would love to sit in a terminal and watch the arrivals hall and see people be re-united. A flight from Australia was due to arrive in Auckland at 11am and another touches down in Wellington at 1pm.

She expected Australians would head over because New Zealand was a safe option and they had nowhere else to go.

She said beyond Cook Islands, Niue and possibly Fiji there were no plans for New Zealand to open up its borders to anywhere else.

New Zealand made its own decisions and would not necessarily open up to the same places as Australia.

Later this morning the government would address the issue with inequity where some critical and essential workers have been allowed to bring families while those who arrived earlier on were not.

The temporary suspension for those travelling from India was in place and Ardern said it was still on track to be lifted at the end of the month as it couldn't render New Zealand citizens stateless.

""Covid is rampant there right now. This is home for many of those travellers.""

""We're heading out!"" a delighted Angus Crampton declared at Wellington Airport before catching a flight to Sydney to see his family.

Sydney-based Rowan Heath will see her 85-year-old mother Heather in Auckland today, one of many tearful reunions as quarantine-free flights finally begin between New Zealand and Australia.

Heath, a 58-year-old teacher from Manly, will be one of the first Australians to take advantage of the transtasman travel bubble opening when she lands about 4.30pm.

About 400 quarantine-free flights per week will arrive and depart Auckland Airport on transtasman routes operated by Air New Zealand, Jetstar and Qantas by the end of April - a stark contrast to the 36 flights to and from Australia in the first week of April.

With her two brothers also in Australia, Heath spoke to the Herald about how hard the separation from her beloved mother had been.

""At the beginning, she was very, very teary saying, 'I'm never going to see you again', and we were like, 'No it's okay', but at 85 you just don't know,"" she said.

""It has been awful, but thank goodness for digital technology because otherwise it would have been absolutely horrendous.""

Normally, Heath crossed the ditch about four times a year. Now her whānau would be spacing out their trips to share time with their mother, who is in a rest home.

Heath expressed her gratitude for how New Zealand handled the Covid-19 pandemic.

""I've been really happy knowing that [mum] has been there, knowing that she's safe.""

More than 5000 Air New Zealand passengers are booked to travel between the two countries on Monday aboard 30 flights between Brisbane, Melbourne, Gold Coast, Perth, Sydney, and Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.

She already had a flight and MIQ booked prior to the announcement of the transtasman bubble, so she was feeling blessed that she now no longer had to quarantine.

The first flight is due to take off just after 7.30am. Auckland Airport chief executive Adrian Littlewood said it's an important day that has taken a long time to get to.

""It's great to see Tasman going again, something that used to be about as uneventful as going to the supermarket, so it's certainly an exciting thing to get back to normal.""

He said the transtasman bubble has taken longer than anticipated. ""I think the path has been a bit unclear as we've all lived through the realities of Covid, and there's no straight-shot out of it either, there's always risks of things changing as we look ahead.

Air New Zealand aircraft, outside the international terminal, readied for take-off to join Australia and New Zealand in a transtasman bubble. Photo / Juliette Sivertsen

""The tourism industry and all travellers will be waiting to see how people feel about travelling again internationally, but I think it will gradually come back.""

Littlewood told Newstalk ZB's Mike Yardley there were 32 return flights scheduled today. Last week there were 36 flights to Australia across the entire week.

""We've got a range of ports across Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, as well as Gold Coast coming in. Later this week we'll have Hobart for the first time. So all up, nine ports across Australia.""

Littlewood said Australia was Auckland Airport's biggest market and the Tasman connection was critical to the bottom line.

""It's major for us, and for the tourism industry. Transtasman was about 40 percent of our international business, so to get that back really is the next step in the slow recovery of our business.""

Duty free shops would slowly be reopening at the terminal, along with food and beverage outlets, but Littlewood said the others will take time as the passenger market recovers.

""You've got to remember these shops have been shut for over a year, they've de-stocked, they've let staff go, so to bring that back does take some time.""

He said discussions about a travel bubble with the Cook Islands were ongoing, with many touting ""summer in May"" as a target date, but that was a decision for the Government.

Littlewood says he's completely confident in the airport's ability to accommodate quarantine-free travel, with multiple checks and audits from the organisations involved, but said there may be some bumps along the way.

""We're bringing a lot of staff back in and they'll have to get used to the new covid routines at the airport if they haven't been around for a year or so.""

Cheryl Mackie was departing from Wellington to go see her two daughters and grandson in Melbourne. ""It's been 13 months,"" she said. ""I never thought the day would come actually.

""Jacqui is there for six weeks. I've got 10 days, I've got to get back to work.""

Air New Zealand chief executive Greg Foran said he relished the ability to bring whānau together again.

""We're humbled to be part of these reunions and reconnecting people who have missed out on so much over the last year.""

He anticipated the national carrier would operate more than 300 flights per week during the July school holidays.

Customers should plan to check-in at least three hours prior to departure on transtasman flights. Masks are required on board and in the airports.

The Australian Travel Declaration must be completed at least 72 hours before departure, along with any state declarations. More details can be found at airnz.click/QFT2AU.

Auckland Airport chief executive Adrian Littlewood expected potential travellers to be cautious at first, as confidence in the bubble grew.

""We saw it unfold in the domestic market, where passenger numbers have gradually recovered since New Zealand began moving out of lockdown nearly a year ago.""

From Wellington this week, there will be 27 return flights to Australia, increasing to about 40 per week by the end of May. Pre-Covid, Australia and the Cook Islands accounted for 66 per cent of Wellington Airport's international travel.

Tourism New Zealand is predicting Australian travellers could bring in at least $1b by the end of the year.

In 2019, Australian visitors accounted for 19 per cent of the total international tourism market spend in Auckland with a value of about $933m.

Money was far from many travellers' minds on Monday morning however, as excited passengers checked in at airports.

Rara Akariri was at Auckland Airport, headed for Melbourne to see her daughter and five grandchildren, who are aged between 7 and 14. She hasn't seen them for two years.

Akariri said she was ""over the moon"" to hear about the transtasman bubble and expects it will be a tearful reunion on the other side when she arrives.

In a joint statement, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the start of two-way quarantine-free travel reflected the sustained efforts of both countries in managing the virus.

Morrison called today's milestone a ""win-win"" for Australians and New Zealanders.

""Both countries have done a remarkable job in protecting our communities from Covid and two-way flights are an important step in our road out.""

Ardern said it was ""truly exciting"" to start quarantine-free travel with Australia.

""Be it returning family, friends or holiday makers, New Zealand says welcome and enjoy yourself.

""The bubble marks a significant step in both countries' reconnection with the world and it's one we should all take a moment to be very proud of.""

The Tasman leaders said in the statement that Australia and New Zealand were exploring opportunities to expand quarantine-free travel to other countries in the Pacific when it is safe to do so.

Auckland mayor Phil Goff welcomed the bubble's anticipated boost to local business, as well as its social benefits.

""The lockdowns have been tough for everyone on both sides of the Tasman, and I know there will be many people who will be thrilled to be reunited with their loved ones, here and in Australia.

""It will give a much-needed boost to those involved in providing tourism, hospitality and retail services, whose jobs and businesses were badly affected by the border closure caused by the pandemic.""

NZ Herald travel writer Juliette Sivertsen is flying Auckland to Sydney and said the terminal is buzzing this morning.

""The airport is full of very very happy, excited travelers, most of them going off to see family they have not seen in a very long time.""

She said told Newstalk ZB's Mike Yardley most of the travel seems be people wanting to reconnect with friends and family, and many were keen to book the first flight out. ""There are a lot of people who have grandchildren or sisters or other family members or perhaps older parents or sick family members - they're all expecting it to be a very tearful reunion on the other side when they finally see their loved ones.

Sivertsen said going through security was very straight forward and not too busy with other flights heading out to Perth, Brisbane, Gold Coast and Melbourne this morning. She said there weren't any health checks, most people are wearing masks and passengers have to fill out a declaration before they land in Australia.

For those passengers keen to squeeze in some duty free shopping, Sivertsen said they were greeted by enthusiastic staff. ""They were all very excited to greet us as we were walking past, very energetic and happy to see passengers again.""",2603,15623,11,68
0,The IMF won’t let Venezuela access its share of new SDRs,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/4/16/venezuela-shunned-out-of-5b-handout-in-imfs-new-reserves,"Venezuela isn’t able to access its existing SDR holdings and won’t be able to use new ones until a government gains official recognition, an IMF spokesman told Bloomberg News.

The International Monetary Fund won’t hand over $5 billion of special drawing rights to Venezuela to bolster its reserves as part of a massive injection of resources to member nations, due to an ongoing dispute over whether President Nicolas Maduro is the legitimate leader of the country.

Venezuela in theory would be among the biggest recipients in terms of percentage of gross domestic product of a proposed $650 billion in special drawing rights that the IMF is planning to give countries to boost global liquidity. This is part of an effort to help emerging and low-income nations deal with mounting debt and Covid-19.

Some Republicans in Congress, including Senators Pat Toomey and John Kennedy, have urged U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to oppose the creation of the reserves, saying they would reward Maduro, among other U.S. adversaries.

But Venezuela won’t be able to access the assets, which most nations will receive via a transfer to their central banks if they are approved as expected by the Fund’s board of governors in the coming months, according to the IMF. That’s because the U.S. and more than 50 other countries regard opposition leader Juan Guaido as the nation’s legitimate leader, following sham presidential elections in 2018.

“The ongoing political crisis in Venezuela has led to a lack of clarity in the international community — as reflected in the IMF’s membership — regarding official government recognition,” IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said in reply to questions from Bloomberg News.

Venezuela isn’t able to access its existing SDR holdings and won’t be able to use new ones “until a government is recognized,” Rice said.

The decision is the latest setback for Maduro’s regime, which has been largely cut off from a global financial network due to U.S. sanctions. After seven years of economic contraction following a collapse in global oil prices, the IMF’s handout of $5.1 billion would have been equivalent to 81% of the nation’s existing international reserves.

Maduro administration officials are considering whether to invite IMF officials to inspect the government’s economic data — a step known as an Article IV evaluation — in an effort to mend the relationship following a 14-year data blackout that left most economists guessing the depths of the nation’s monumental collapse, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.

Yet, because the Maduro government is barred from having contact, discussions or access to financing from the IMF until it’s recognized as the official government, that Article IV evaluation can’t presently take place.

Press officials for Venezuela’s presidency did not respond to requests for comment.

While the IMF suspended Venezuela’s access to SDRs in 2019 citing political chaos, the relationship between the two has long been contentious. In 2007, late President Hugo Chavez pledged to cut ties with the Washington organization, contending that the Fund merely served U.S. interests.

“This is the kind of initiative that a country like Venezuela could really take advantage of in the face of the ongoing crisis,” said Temir Porras, a former senior economic aide to Chavez and Maduro. “It’s time for a more pragmatic approach, not just to immediately attend to urgent health needs, but to contribute to the stabilization of our economy.”

Venezuela SDR holdings had fallen more than 99% from their allocated level as of last month, down to just $12.5 million from $3.6 billion in 2009, when it was a recipient of reserves during the global financial crisis, according to IMF data. More than two-thirds of Venezuela’s foreign reserves are in the form of gold, which has been difficult to sell because of U.S. sanctions.",626,3892,11,56
0,Peloton Tread+ owners told to stop using the treadmill in 'urgent warning',https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/17/business/peloton-tread-plus-cpsc-statement/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) A US government agency issued an ""urgent warning"" for users of Peloton's Tread+ following multiple dangerous incidents with the machine, including a child's death.

In a news release Saturday, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said it has become aware of 39 accidents involving the treadmill, including ""multiple reports of children becoming entrapped, pinned, and pulled under"" the $4,295 device. The CPSC said it's urging customers with small children and pets to stop using the machine immediately.

The statement comes after a March incident with the machine that involved a child's death. Peloton CEO John Foley sent a letter to Tread+ owners at the time, saying the warning comes after a ""tragic accident involving a child and the Tread+, resulting in, unthinkably, a death.""

The CPSC released a video showing a small child playing with a powered-on treadmill while it lifts off the ground and the child becomes pinned under it. The agency released details of other incidents, including a child being injured when an adult was using it and ""pets and objects"" also being sucked beneath it suggesting ""possible harm to the user if the user loses balance as a result.""

Peloton PTON blasted the CPSC in a release Saturday, calling its warning ""inaccurate and misleading."" Peloton said there's ""no reason"" to stop using the machine if safety instructions, such as correctly using its safety key, are followed. It also said that the Tread+ should be kept away from children under 16 years old and pets ""at all times.""

""It's believed the child, who was holidaying with his family, had been playing outside a house, when neighbours heard a commotion,"" RACQ LifeFlight Rescue said in a statement.

""They reportedly went to investigate and saw a dingo attacking the toddler.""

The boy, accompanied by his mother, was flown to a hospital from Fraser Island off the eastern coast and is in stable condition.

The dingo is a protected species on Fraser Island and are a popular attraction for camping tourists. The island's dingo population is estimated to be around 200, with packs of up to 30 roaming the island, according to the Queensland Department of Environment and Science.

In 1980 baby Azaria Chamberlain disappeared from a tent in a camping ground in Australia's outback, with her mother claiming she was taken by a dingo. The baby's body was never found, creating a mystery that captivated Australians for years and was made into a book and a film with Meryl Streep and Sam Neill.

Azaria's mother Lindy was jailed for three years over her daughter's death before later being cleared. A court ruled in 2012 that a dingo killed Azaria.

Dingoes, introduced to Australia about 4,000 years ago, are protected in Queensland state's national parks, World Heritage areas, Aboriginal reserves, and the Australian Capital Territory. Elsewhere, they are a declared a pest species.

They hold a significant place in the spiritual and cultural practices of many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.",285,1742,12,78

1,Blatant Rip-Off: The Main Character In ‘Ghost Of Tsushima’ Is Clearly Modeled On The Samurai From Japanese History,https://ogn.theonion.com/blatant-rip-off-the-main-character-in-ghost-of-tsushi-1844415830,"Well, gamers, this is a huge letdown. After years of hype around Sucker Punch’s upcoming open-world epic Ghost Of Tsushima, we learned today from an insider source that the main character is a direct rip-off of a warrior from Japanese history known as the “samurai.”

This brazen theft is a disappointing revelation, and one that will make enjoying this title difficult, if not impossible.

What makes this even harder to take is that when we first saw previews of the Infamous and Sly Cooper developer’s latest release, we were absolutely blown away by the creativity that had gone into crafting the game’s fictional world. Every detail—from the so-called Bushido code of ethics to the weapon known as the tanto—appeared to be novel innovations showcasing the studio’s knack for worldbuilding. Sadly, however, we have now discovered that everything from the game’s aesthetic to its core conceit of attacking other soldiers with swords is nothing more than a halfhearted copy of this little-known class of Japan’s medieval hereditary nobility.

Of course, it was natural for Sucker Punch to assume no one would notice that they had cribbed innumerable details about the so-called “samurai” from Japan’s history. After all, words like “katana” and “ninja” are long forgotten in Japan. Meanwhile, the average American couldn’t even guess at their meaning, let alone connect them with a class of sword-wielding Japanese soldiers committed to loyalty to their feudal lord above all else. Frankly, it’s the same liberty that Rockstar Games took in plundering America’s history for the idea of “cowboys” in Red Dead Redemption, which, lest we forget, was based upon an oft-overlooked cohort of real-life outdoorsman and herders from the nineteenth century.

With all of this said, Sucker Punch should be applauded for rescuing the samurai from the dustbin of history. It must have been exhilarating to the game’s creators to open some dusty Japanese history book and realize the gameplay potential these forgotten swordsmen might have. Who knows? In the future, we might even see movies, books, and even other video games based on the fascinating idea of blade-wielding Japanese warriors dedicated to the martial virtues and an unflinching approach to pain. Let’s just hope the artists using these ideas remember to cite their sources!",373,2346,18,114

Trump voters are a huge constituency, especially in crucial swing states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and it’s going to be tough to win them over if we keep alienating them with our rhetoric. We want a broad coalition here, which includes Trump supporters, and so going forward we’re eliminating any negative remarks about Donald Trump in campaign ads and speeches. It’s time to take a stand and say that defeating Trump is simply not what the Biden campaign stands for.” Reports from the Biden campaign also indicated that strategists were gaming out how many swing-state Trump supporters they would win over if they formally endorsed the president’s reelection.

0,Pfizer CEO: Third vaccine dose ‘likely’ needed within 12 months,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/16/pfizer-ceo-vaccine-third-dose-likely-needed-within-12-months-2,"Researchers currently do not know how long vaccines provide protection against the coronavirus.

The head of Pfizer has said that people will “likely” need a third dose of his company’s COVID-19 shot within six to 12 months of vaccination, while defending the relatively higher cost of the jab.

CEO Albert Bourla also said annual vaccinations against the coronavirus may well be required.

“We need to see what would be the sequence, and for how often we need to do that, that remains to be seen,” Bourla told broadcaster CNBC in an interview aired on Thursday.

“A likely scenario is that there will be likely a need for a third dose, somewhere between six and 12 months and then from there, there will be an annual revaccination, but all of that needs to be confirmed,” he said, adding that variants will play a “key role”.

“It is extremely important to suppress the pool of people that can be susceptible to the virus.”

Researchers currently do not know how long vaccines provide protection against the coronavirus.

Earlier this month, Pfizer published a study that said its jab is more than 91-percent effective at protecting against the coronavirus and more than 95-percent effective against severe cases of COVID-19 up to six months after the second dose.

But researchers say more data is needed to determine whether protection lasts after six months.

Rising prices

Bourla also defended the price of his company’s vaccine, saying they are saving lives and will not be sold to poor countries for a profit.

“Vaccines are very expensive,” Bourla said in an interview with several European news outlets.

“They save human lives, they allow economies to reopen but we sell them at the price of a meal,” he was quoted as saying.

According to data released several months ago by a member of the Belgian government, the Pfizer coronavirus jab has been the most expensive one for the European Union, along with the Moderna vaccine.

Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov explained earlier this week that the vaccine’s price was rising as sales were being negotiated, costing as much as 19.50 euros ($23), up from 12 euros ($14).

The prices are in sharp contrast to the vaccine produced by British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca, which pledged not to make a profit on its product during the pandemic and sold it to the EU for less than two euros ($2.39) a unit.

Bourla did not confirm the price of the Pfizer vaccine but admitted that it was sold at a higher price to developed countries like the US or those in the EU.

“In middle-income countries, we sell it for half the price,” he said. “In poorer countries, including in Africa, we sell it at cost.”",453,2662,10,63

0,Russian suspects in Salisbury poisoning linked to blast in Czech Republic,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/18/europe/czech-republic-russia-salisbury-poisoning-intl/index.html,"(CNN) The suspects of the 2018 novichok nerve agent poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, England, have been linked to a 2014 blast in the Czech Republic that killed two people.

Czech police said Saturday that they were searching for two men in connection with a serious crime. Czech police released images matching those of the Salisbury suspects, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov. UK officials said the men are behind a 2014 explosion at an ammunition depot in Vrbetice.

The Czech police added that the men are known to be carrying various passports, including Russian passports with Petrov and Boshirov's names.

Moscow has denied any involvement with the Salisbury incident, and the men who identified themselves as Petrov and Boshirov claimed they briefly visited the historic cathedral city as tourists. Putin has said the two men identified as suspects are ""not criminals.""

The UK foreign office said on Sunday: ""It has been announced by the Czech authorities that the two GRU Officers that were charged with the attempted murder of the Skripals in Salisbury, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, were also behind the deaths of two civilians and an explosion in the Czech town of Vrbetice.""

Czech police say the men were in the Czech Republic between October 11 and October 16 of 2014, and added they also carried passports from Moldova and Tajikistan, under the names of Nicolai Popa and Ruslan Tabarov respectively.

Shortly before the announcement, the Czech Republic said it would expel 18 employees of the Russian Embassy in Prague in retaliation for the 2014 explosion, which caused huge financial and environmental damage.

""As Foreign Minister I decided to expel all employees of the Russian Embassy who were clearly identified by our security services as officers of Russian Intelligence Services, SVR and GRU,"" Acting Foreign Minister Jan Hamacek said at the time.

Russia will take ""retaliatory measures"" against the Czech Republic over the move, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Sunday.

The decision to expel 18 embassy employees was ""based on unfounded and far-fetched excuses about the involvement of Russian special services in the explosion of 2014 at military depots in Vrbetice settlement,"" the statement said.

""This is even more absurd, since the Czech leadership previously blamed the companies that own these warehouses for explosions,"" it added.

The Russian ministry alleged the move was ""an effort to please the United States against the background of recent US sanctions against Russia, the Czech authorities have even surpassed their overseas masters in this regard.""

Russian intelligence service

Prime Minister Andrej Babiš said Saturday ""there is well founded suspicion that officers of Russian Intelligence Services GRU, unit 29155 were connected to the explosion of a munition depots in Vrbetice in the year 2014.""

He added that the blast ""caused enormous material damage, serious threat and disruption of people's lives, but especially, it killed two of our citizens, two unexpected and innocent fathers.""

Babiš said he informed the European Council President Charles Michel about the investigation into the explosion. The Czech Republic will discuss the explosion with NATO and European Union allies on Monday, according to a tweet sent early Sunday by Hamacek.

Hamacek was scheduled to travel to Moscow in the coming days to discuss the possibility of the Czech Republic acquiring the Russian Covid-19 vaccine. The trip has been canceled because he would be ""needed at the government's meeting on Monday,"" he said.

After that announcement, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Russian state news agency TASS, ""Prague is well aware of what will follow such tricks.""

In a tweet sent Sunday, Deputy Chief of Mission at the US Embassy in Prague Jennifer Bachus said, ""The United States stands with its steadfast Ally, the Czech Republic. We appreciate their significant action to impose costs on Russia for its dangerous actions on Czech soil.""

British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK ""stands in ""stands in full support of our Czech allies, who have exposed the lengths that the Russian intelligence services will go to in their attempts to conduct dangerous and malign operations in Europe.""

He added that it showed "" a pattern of behavior by Moscow, following the Novichok attack in Salisbury.""

NATO said Sunday it supported the Czech Republic as it ""investigates Russia's malign activities on its territory.""

""We express our sympathy to the loved ones of the victims of the explosion in Vrbetice. Those responsible must be brought to justice,"" a NATO official said in a statement.

Relations between London and Moscow deteriorated in 2018 when the UK government pointed the finger of blame at the two Russians it said were the agents of the GRU. The bitter diplomatic fight also saw a wave of tit-for-tat expulsions between Russia and Western nations.

This week the administration of US President Joe Biden targeted Russia with sweeping sanctions and diplomatic expulsions, punishing Moscow for its interference in the 2020 US election, its SolarWinds cyberattack and its ongoing occupation and ""severe human rights abuses"" in Crimea.

Typhoon Surigae is packing 115-120 knots of sustained winds and has become a violent tropical cyclone. It will become a powerful Category 5 typhoon before turning towards the northern Philippines on Sunday and Monday. Surigae is the first typhoon of the 2021 Pacific season.

*** IMPORTANT UPDATE – SEE BELOW ***

UPDATE: A Category 5 Super Typhoon Surigae peaks at 190 mph and 888 mbar, becoming the most intense April tropical cyclone on record, heads further northwest across the Philippine Sea



******

Based on the latest satellite data observation, typhoon Surigae has already reached its maximum sustained winds of 115-120 knots, a 50-knot increase in the last 24 hours. Central pressure is below 940 mbar. Typhoon Surigae is increasingly likely becoming a Category 5 system over the next 24 hours, earning the Super Typhoon status according to the weather model and satellite analysis.

This would then be the first Category 5 system on Earth this year. The last tropical cyclone that struck the Philippines was a real monster, a Category 5 typhoon Goni. Goni was a Super Typhoon with 170 knots winds, becoming one of the most powerful tropical cyclones ever recorded on our planet.

The Eyewall Replacement Cycle (EWRC) with Surigae is almost finished this Saturday morning (local time) which will help the typhoon to gain even more strength and probably continue with its rapid intensification. As soon as the large eye warms and clears, an even faster intensification rate could take place. Typhoon Surigae may reach 130-140 knots when the peak will occur on Sunday.

Surigae also got its secondary designated name Bising after entering the tropical area monitored by the Philippine Meteorological Agency (PAGASA). Typhoon Surigae is also the first tropical cyclone that formed anywhere in the northern hemisphere this year.

Very favorable oceanic and environmental conditions are present ahead of its track this weekend, which will help to boost its intensity even more. The wind shear is also very low, so we are basically seeing near-ideal conditions for a rapid intensification until Surigae strengthens to the maximum, Category 5 strength.

Typhoon Surigae remains an extremely dangerous system for the Philippines late this weekend into early next week as it nears the northern parts of the country. It may blast into the north-northeast Philippines with a massive amount of rainfall and violent winds with life-threatening storm surge.

Prior to Surigae, a strong tropical cyclone Seroja struck Western Australia last week. After a spectacular Fujiwhara effect of two merging tropical cyclones, Seroja and Odette.

In a typical year, about 8 tropical cyclones threaten the land of the Philippines, the highest number of tropical systems that strike any country around the world.

DEEP MJO WAVE EMERGED OVER THE VERY WARM PACIFIC OCEAN

The sea surface temperatures over the western Pacific are very warm lately, even extremely warm/hot further west towards the Indian Sea. Temperatures are reaching about 29 to 30 °C (84-86 °F). Hot seas with temperatures even above 31 °C (87 °F) are seen over the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea.

These are definitely strongly supportive oceanic conditions for the very rapid intensification of any tropical cyclone. This is also the main reason why Surigae has literally exploded into a powerful Category 4 typhoon this Friday and is likely going for the Category 5 strength soon.

The Philippine Sea waters remain quite higher than the long-term average, about 1 °C above normal. Strongly anomalous sea temperature often leads to the explosive development of deep storms, commencing to very well-organized tropical cyclones. Often undergoing rapid intensification.

As we can see from the attached sea temperature anomaly chart below, the majority of the western Pacific is well above average. Also further west across the Indian Sea. Having the highest temperature anomaly around Japan and across the Northwest Pacific.

On both charts above, notice also how cold waters are still present over the Bering Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk, being still partly frozen. Thanks to frigid Arctic conditions still in place that far north through this mid-April.

Another factor that has significantly increased the chances for tropical development over the western Pacific is the so-called MJO wave. The wave coincides well with the above normal sea temperatures over the Pacific. The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is the largest and most dominant source of short-term tropical variability. An eastward-moving wave of thunderstorms circles the entire planet on the equator in about 30 to 60 days.

The MJO consists of two phases, one is the enhanced rainfall (wet phase) and the other is the suppressed rainfall (dry phase). This means that there are increased storms and a lot of rainfall on one side and reduced storms and drier weather on the other side. The wet phase leads to diverging air parcels while the dry phase brings converging air parcels. This horizontal movement of the air is referred to as the Velocity Potential (VP) in the tropics.

We are able to track the entire MJO wave movement by looking at the larger scale air parcels movement. With the weather model data, we can easily see the areas where the air is rising and where it is subsiding.

The graphics below, provided by Michael J. Ventrice, Ph.D. represent an MJO wave with filtered VP200* anomalies (see details below) for the current state, for the week 1 forecast, and for the week 2 forecast.

Cold colors are representative of a more favorable state over the Pacific Ocean for tropical cyclogenesis while warm colors represent a less favorable state for tropical cyclogenesis (e.g. over Africa and South Atlantic).

*VP200 – means a Velocity Potential (VP). It is an indicator of the large-scale divergent flow, so at upper levels in the tropics. The negative VP anomalies (shaded blue in the diagram) are closely tied to the divergent outflow from enhanced convective regions.

Notice how extremely deep the MJO wave is over the western Pacific. Undoubtedly we can see this is a very significant signal of the upward motion, supporting vigorous convection in the region where typhoon Surigae formed.

Another important factor is the Ocean Heat Content (OHC). The OHC takes into account the depth of the sea, and how warm the water layers are deep below the sea surface. Lately, we can see a large pool of high available oceanic heat energy with a very warm water layer running down quite deep over the Philippine Sea. Taking a closer look, one can see how Surigae is moving right into the very favorable conditions this weekend.

Deepwater is also quite warm which typically provides a very favorable environment of a thick layer of warm water. Tropical systems are fueled by these warm layers, as deep convective storms draw energy from hot water. Long story short: the thicker the warm layers are, the more fuel/energy is available to feed the storms.

Typhoon Surigae/Bising has tracked west-northwestward at 9 knots overnight to Saturday. Animated enhanced infrared satellite imagery reveals that Bising has rapidly intensified over the past six hours, with the eye of around 5-10 nautical miles clearing.

Based on the advanced Dvorak estimation, the initial intensity is at around 115-120 knots, a solid Category 4 typhoon. The environmental analysis reveals that a very low shear of 10-15 knots is present over the Philippine Sea, with an impressive equatorward and poleward upper-level outflow ventilation. Attached above is a visible satellite during the early morning hours on Saturday.

Typhoon Surigae will continue intensifying this Saturday and will reach a Category 5 strength over the next 12-24 hours. And become a very violent tropical cyclone while gradually moving northwest over the next couple of days. Attached wind gusts swath map below hints how intense winds Surigae could develop – more than 250 km/h while moving towards the north-northeast Philippines.

The exact track of typhoon Surigae is, however, yet unknown, as some global weather models are taking a more westerly shift while some of them suggest a more northerly track.

In the case of Surigae taking the more western track, the system could spread heavy rains with massive flooding and severe damaging winds from the eastern Mindanao to eastern Visaya, and eastern Luzon over the weekend into early next week.

Attached below is the rainfall total map over the next 10 days, based on the ECMWF model. An *extreme* amount of rainfall could happen over the northern Luzon island and could lead to destructive flooding. It indeed strongly depends on how west shift the tropical cyclone will take over the next 24 hours. We can see 500-800 mm of rain will be possible.

Coastal flooding is likely to be expected, especially in bays and inlets, depending on where the Surigae’s center will pass. Destructive wave will blast the coast with major storm surge, potentially leading to land erosion.

After typhoon Surigae moves away from the Philippines, it will rapidly lose its strength coming into much less favorable oceanic conditions for tropical cyclones. However, conditions need to be very closely monitored of Surigae would threaten Japan island Iwo To. Stay tuned for further updates!

1,Nostalgia Trip: ‘Tony Hawk's Pro Skater’ Developers Confirm Remake's Only Change Will Be Every Character Knowing The Iraq War Happened,https://ogn.theonion.com/nostalgia-trip-tony-hawks-pro-skater-developers-conf-1844883885,"When we heard the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 remaster would be hitting shelves in September, we knew we’d be in for one heck of a flashback. Our early hands-on with the Warehouse demo confirms that everything we loved about the original titles are back in full force. (Just try not to melt into a puddle of gooey nostalgia when Goldfinger’s “Superman” soundtracks your first noseslide). Interestingly, though, developers Vicarious Visions revealed to OGN that the game features one major change: Every character in the game will know that the Iraq War happened.

“Obviously, we wanted to do justice replicating all the amazing details that make the original so beloved, but we also knew we wanted to mix things up by making sure in-game characters like Bob Burnquist, Kareem Campbell, and Tony Hawk are all aware of the United State’s decision to invade Iraq in 2003,” said senior developer Christian Santos, describing the agonizing hours spent to make sure each character model reflects the grim realities of an eight-year invasion with unclear goals that left half a million Iraqis dead. “Officer Dick is back as an unlockable, too. We spent so much time getting the slump in his stance just right to show how—even though he’s ollying and grinding his way through kickass levels such as Roswell—his faith in national institutions has been completely shattered from the sustained campaign of lies about Saddam Hussein’s possession of weapons of mass destruction.”



“You can see it in these characters’ eyes: These are skateboarders living in a world where America’s role on the world stage has become deeply ambiguous,” he continued.

Going on to explain that his team had paid painstaking of recreating fan-favorite levels like New York City, Santos stressed that the remake took liberties only when strictly necessary such as when skaters grind toward the September 11th Memorial and spontaneously shout lines like, “How the hell did this invasion even factor into the War on Terror?” and, “4,424 American soldiers dead—d o Rumsfeld or Rice even care?” and, “S kateboarding just doesn’t feel the same in a post-Iraq War age.”

Welp, color us impressed. We already couldn’t wait to manual our way around some of our favorite skateboarding levels of all time. But it sounds like Vicarious Visions has given this remake just the dash of spice to make us even more intrigued. Rock on, gamers!

0,US company illegally peddling ‘miracle cure’ bleach for new Covid variants,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/15/us-company-florida-oclo-bleach-covid-variants,"Peddlers of industrial bleach who urge Americans to drink the fluid as a “miracle cure” for cancer, HIV/Aids and other diseases have begun touting the product illegally as a treatment for the latest variants of Covid-19.

Chlorine dioxide, a powerful bleaching agent used in textile and paper manufacturing, is being compounded and sold out of a makeshift laboratory in Miami, Florida. The company, Oclo Nanotechnology Science, is playing on fears of the new strain of the coronavirus discovered in the UK, which is now spreading rapidly and widely through the US.

The UK variant, B117, is thought to be more transmissible and deadly than the initial form of the virus.

The Miami company is invoking B117 to drive up sales of its bleach products, which the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns are potentially dangerous and can be life-threatening. The front page of Oclo’s website is dominated by a photograph of vials of its chlorine dioxide product billed as an “antiviral” treatment.

The image is superimposed with the words: “B117 … new variant of coronavirus, the most contagious and dangerous in the United States. Rescuing chlorine dioxide and its great curative potential against pathogens.”

The appearance of a new marketing push out of Miami by peddlers of the bleach “cure”, often referred to as “miracle mineral solution”, or MMS, signals the FDA’s uphill struggle in trying to control the potentially lethal trade. Since the start of the pandemic, the federal agency has been clamping down on fraudulent products which claim to treat or cure Covid-19.

It has also been using its enforcement muscle to move against chlorine dioxide dealers. Last August, the FDA arrested Mark Grenon and his four sons, who were among the most prominent “miracle” bleach peddlers in the US.

Members of the Grenon family claimed to be “bishops” of the Florida-based Genesis II “church” that sold bleach under the guise that it was a “sacrament”. They remain in jails in Miami and Colombia awaiting extradition to the US facing charges of conspiracy to defraud the US and to introduce a misbranded drug into interstate commerce.

Having taken down Genesis II, the FDA is now facing outcrops of new MMS dealers. Oclo is run by a former Cuban living in Hallandale Beach, north of Miami.

Ricardo Garcia describes himself as a “research and development scientist” trained in chemistry at the University of Havana, though he also identifies as a real estate agent. Most of his customers in the US are Latino Americans.

He is also known to be offering to transport bleach in enema form to Europe for use on autistic children, at a cost of $680 per liter plus shipping.

In text messages between Garcia and an autism advocate based in Europe, he said that he was distributing the vials mainly in “local areas in the USA”. He added: “We have been censored several times on social media but are still producing to save lives.”

Despite Garcia’s protestations, his main trading route still appears to be through social media sites. He promotes his toxic products on Facebook, Amazon and eBay.

He clearly has some success selling through Amazon. His “immune booster against pathogens”, costing $49.99, is a bestseller ranked 105 in the “sports nutrition and hydration products” category.

The Guardian asked Garcia why he was selling bleach illegally as a treatment for the B117 strain of Covid and other diseases. He gave the reply: “We are really sorry for the loss of your loved one. Thank you for publishing the latest scientific advances with chlorine dioxide in the treatment of Covid-19. We have a great interest in saving lives – you too, right?”

The Guardian also contacted the three social media giants to ask them why they were hosting a potentially life-threatening fraudulent “cure” on their platforms. Within hours eBay responded by blocking the Oclo page.

An eBay spokesperson said: “Our first priority is to ensure the safety of our employees and customers around the world. We are taking significant measures to block or quickly remove items on our marketplace that make false health claims, including listings that promote chlorine dioxide as a cure for Covid.”

Amazon was more ambivalent. It said that third-party sellers were “independent businesses” required to follow all applicable laws and regulations.

“Those who violate our policies are subject to action including potential removal of their account,” Amazon said. It left the Oclo page up, however.

Facebook did not reply.

Fiona O’Leary, a campaigner against pseudoscience, said she was concerned about Garcia because unlike other bleach peddlers he was a practicing scientist. “It’s very worrying to me because he’s a professional, and I’ve never seen a scientist make this product before. He has more knowledge on the chemicals and he’s going to be trusted more.”

Garcia claims to follow the protocols of Andreas Kalcker, one of the leading figures in the bleach “cure” movement. Kalcker, a German citizen who lives in Switzerland, is author of an influential book, Forbidden Health.

He is reported to be under criminal investigation in Argentina following the deaths of a five-year-old boy and a man aged 50 who both drank chlorine dioxide.

On his website, Garcia claims that his product treats autism – a common and especially abusive application of bleach. He quotes a parent who says that their experience of chlorine dioxide was “truly miraculous. Our five-year-old son with autism has been able to make an extraordinary recovery.”

Garcia also quotes a New York resident who says his grandfather almost died from Covid but recovered after drinking the bleach.

His site encourages consumers to buy chlorine dioxide and give it to their dogs as well as marketing the fluid as a treatment for vaginal infections in women. “Vaginal washing with a solution of chlorine dioxide allows the treatment of some vaginal and other sexually transmitted diseases,” it claims.",972,5954,11,74
0,‘It’s a day off’: Transcripts of conversations between Italian officials and Libyan coastguard contained in leaked file show people on dinghies in distress were left to die,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/16/wiretaps-migrant-boats-italy-libya-coastguard-mediterranean,"At 8.18am on Friday 16 June 2017, the Libyan coastguard Col Massoud Abdalsamad received a long-distance phone call from an Italian coastguard official who told him that 10 migrant dinghies were in distress, many in Libyan territorial waters.

“It’s a day off. It’s a holiday here. But I can try to help,” Abdalsamad told the official. “Perhaps we can be there tomorrow.”

Later that day Abdalsamad claimed that his men had saved many of the stricken migrants. According to data compiled by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), by the end of the weekend, 126 people had died.

In February of that year, Europe had ceded responsibility for overseeing Mediterranean rescue operations to Libya as part of a deal struck between Italy and Libya aimed at reducing migrant flows across the sea.

The conversation, recorded by prosecutors in Sicily investigating sea rescue charities for alleged complicity in people-smuggling, lays bare the indifference of individuals on the Libyan side to the plight of migrants and to international law.

It is one of several revelations from the transcripts of wiretaps on Libyan coastguard officials’ phones, contained in a leaked 30,000-page file produced by Italian prosecutors that has been seen by the Guardian.

The revelations are being published as part of a joint investigation by the Guardian, the Italian public broadcaster Rai News and the Domani newspaper. They appear to show that Italian authorities knew that Libyan authorities were either unwilling or incapable of looking after migrant boats at sea, even as Italy launched investigations into the role of nongovernmental organisation boats at sea that prevented NGOs from carrying out private rescue operations.

Between 22 and 27 March 2017, hundreds of people who had set off from Sabratha in Libya requested aid from the Italian maritime rescue coordination centre. The transcripts show that Italian officials attempted to contact Abdalsamad and at least two other officials a number of times, but often the “result was negative”. The Italian authorities eventually lost contact with the dinghies. On 29 March the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) confirmed the deaths of 146 people, including children and many pregnant women.

On 24 May 2017, two boats that had left Libya carrying hundreds of people started taking in water and one capsized. The people on board contacted the Italian coastguard, which called Abdalsamad 55 times without receiving a reply. Thirty-three people died, according to the UNHCR.

In a restricted 2018 report by Operation Sophia, the European mission to fight illegal immigration, which has been seen by the Guardian, officials wrote that “reporting by Libyan Coast Guard it is not yet at a consistently acceptable standard” and that “the lack of feedback provided by the Joint Operation Room continues to be an issue”. The report highlighted “a critical infrastructure situation (limited communication systems, power supply, telephones and personal computers)” and said the situation was “further adversely conditioned by a limited presence of personnel with insufficient language (English) skills”.

For years Libyan authorities have been accused of intercepting dinghies and returning people to detention centres in Libya, where aid agencies say they suffer torture and abuse.

Riccardo Gatti, head of mission for the Spanish NGO rescue boat Proactiva Open Arms, said it was “almost always impossible” to contact the Libyans, and that phone numbers often don’t work or are nonexistent.

Francesco Creazzo, a spokesperson for the NGO rescue boat SOS Méditerranée, said Libyan authorities were “mostly unresponsive, regardless of the day of the week”.

“The delays in communication at sea and the lack of capacity to coordinate from the Libyan JRCC [joint rescue coordination centre] further endangers people’s lives and has an unacceptable human cost,” said Ellen van der Velden, Médecins sans Frontiéres search and rescue operations manager.

“The crux of the matter, however, remains that the EU is prioritising surveillance of the borders over search and rescue, and has given the responsibility of maritime coordination in a large part of the sea to the JRCC.”

In a document produced by Italian prosecutors, investigators describe Abdalsamad as “uncollaborative”, adding that in the 16 June incident he denied “authorisation of an NGO vessel in Libyan waters to rescue two dinghies that were adrift”.

Later that same day, Abdalsamad informed Rome that the Libyan coastguard had intercepted five dinghies and rescued hundreds of people, but prosecutors have not produced any documents corroborating that statement.

Reached by the Guardian, Abdalsamad said that he was unable to answer any questions relating to events in 2017 because “it would be too hard to find the recordings of these events”. However, he did acknowledge that “communications with his Italian counterparts do not always work well” and that there were “telecommunication problems in Libya that cause frequent interruptions”.

“You must understand that Libya is a country that has suffered a war,” he said.

The Sicilian magistrates who wiretapped Abdalsamad for months as part of their investigation into NGOs have not indicted any Libyan officials.

Last week the Italian justice ministry announced that it had sent inspectors to Trapani in Sicily to “urgently carry out the necessary preliminary investigations” into the prosecutors’ inquiry after reports that at least 15 journalists covering the NGO case and human rights lawyers had been recorded in conversation with confidential sources.

Trapani’s acting head prosecutor, Maurizio Agnello, said in a statement that he “believes it is most opportune and responsible for me not to participate in any further discussions in this matter”.",999,6446,27,172

REUTERS/Diego Vara

Brazil's hospitals were running out of drugs needed to sedate COVID-19 patients on Thursday, with the government urgently seeking to import supplies amid reports of the seriously ill being tied down and intubated without effective sedatives.

Health Minister Marcelo Queiroga said Brazil was in talks with Spain and other countries to secure the emergency drugs. Hospitals, he added, were also struggling to get enough oxygen.

The scenes playing out across Brazil, one of the countries hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, are placing growing international pressure on President Jair Bolsonaro.

Aid group Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said Brazil's ""failed response"" had led to thousands of avoidable deaths and created a humanitarian catastrophe that could still get worse.

Brazil has recorded a total of 361,884 coronavirus deaths - only the United States has more - and 13,673,507 confirmed cases.

More Brazilians are currently dying of the virus each day than anywhere else in the world, with South America's largest country reporting another 3,560 deaths on Thursday. Bolsonaro has opposed lockdowns and held large events in which he often does not wear a mask. He has only recently embraced vaccines as a possible solution.

Brazil's hospitals are struggling to cope.

Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo have both sounded the alarm over shortages of sedatives, with Sao Paulo's Health Secretary saying the city's ability to care for seriously ill COVID-19 patients is on the verge of collapse.

""I never thought that I would be living through something like this after 20 years working in intensive care,"" Aureo do Carmo Filho, an ICU doctor in Rio, told Reuters.

""Using mechanical restraints without sedatives is bad practice ... the patient is submitted to a form of torture,"" he said.

Seriously ill COVID-19 patients struggling for breath are sedated in order to put them on ventilators, an intrusive practice the body can naturally resist.

With ICU beds at or near capacity across the country, hospitals are being forced to create improvised intensive care beds which often lack equipment or professional expertise.

Globo television network on Wednesday reported cases from a Rio hospital in which patients were intubated with a lack of sedatives, tied to beds.

The Albert Schweitzer hospital, through the press office of the city of Rio which runs it, said there was a shortage of intubation drugs but that substitutes were being used to ensure medical assistance was not compromised. It said mechanical restraints were only used when prescribed by a doctor.

The city of Rio added that a batch of intubation drugs was set to arrive on Thursday.

Sao Paulo blamed the shortage on the federal government.

""The irresponsibility and neglect of Brazilian lives is unbelievable,"" Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria said on Twitter.

""FAILED RESPONSE""

Médecins Sans Frontières said Bolsonaro's government had not done enough to prevent the tragedy.

""More than one year into the COVID-19 pandemic, the failed response in Brazil has caused a humanitarian catastrophe,"" said Christos Christou, a medical doctor and president of MSF, called Doctors Without Borders in English.

""Each week there is a grim new record of deaths and infections - the hospitals are overflowing and yet there is still no coordinated centralized response,"" Christou said in a briefing with reporters, adding that the situation was expected to become even worse in the weeks ahead.

Bolsonaro has openly fought against state and local governments seeking to institute lockdowns, saying Brazilians need to get on with normal life and that job losses are more dangerous than the virus.

MSF Director-General Meinie Nicolai said the surge in cases cannot be blamed only on the contagious Brazilian COVID-19 variant, known as P.1.

""The P.1 variant is certainly a problem, but this doesn't explain the situation in Brazil,"" she said.

0,Single-use plastics dominate debris on the North Pacific's deep ocean floor,https://academictimes.com/single-use-plastics-dominate-debris-on-the-north-pacifics-deep-ocean-floor/,"By doing video surveillance deep in the ocean, researchers working in the North Pacific have discovered the densest accumulation of plastic waste ever recorded on an abyssal seafloor, finding that the majority of this waste is single-use packaging.

The study, published March 29 in Marine Pollution Bulletin, highlights the huge environmental burden of single-use plastic, and also sheds more light on what happens to plastic once it goes into the sea.

""The majority of plastic debris that [ends] up in the ocean [is] missing,"" said Ryota Nakajima, a marine biology researcher at the Japan Agency for Marine Earth-Science and Technology. ""Each year, more than 10 million tons of plastics make their way into the ocean, but the abundance of plastics floating on the ocean surface represents merely a few percent of the plastics in the ocean.""

More precisely, between 4.8 million and 12.7 million tons of plastic makes its way into the ocean every year. Plastic in the ocean poses a huge threat to the safety of the environment, particularly when it deteriorates into microplastics. Plastic disrupts habitats, is mistaken for food by animals and spreads volatile toxins through the water.

However, most plastic waste is deep in the sea, leaving many people blissfully unaware of the harm it causes.

""The abundance of plastic debris leaking into the ocean continues to increase, but the floating plastic debris on the surface of the ocean eventually is transported into the deeper water,"" Nakajima said. ""This will foster illusions in your mind that debris is not increasing. But the truth is, plastic debris accumulates on the deep-sea floor as undying garbage.""

Nakajima and his colleagues sought to track some of it down in the oceans around Japan, which he described as ""a hotspot of floating microplastics.""

According to a 2015 report from Science on plastic ocean pollution, 12 of the top 20 countries with the most poorly managed plastic waste are in Asia, with China being the worst.

The proximity of these plastic-producing countries to the Kuroshio ocean current, one of the largest in the world, allows excessive waste to accumulate within the recirculation gyres, areas of the current where water moves in a continuous circle.

From there, the plastic eventually sinks and comes to rest on the ocean floor. It was on the abyssal seafloor underneath one of these recirculation gyres that Nakajima and his colleagues searched for plastic by diving 5,800 meters in a submarine and capturing footage.

They found a massive accumulation of waste.

""Our data confirm that view that the debris problem in the marine environment is serious even in the abyssal zone,"" Nakajima said, adding that bottom-dwelling plastic ""is ubiquitous on the abyssal plain.""

To understand better what kinds of plastic are trapped by currents like the Kuroshio, the team was also interested in characterizing the type of waste found on the abyssal seafloor.

They found that more than 80% of the debris was single-use plastics such as bags, food packaging and water bottles. And the overall density of plastics found in the area, 4,561 items per square kilometer, was the largest ever recorded on any abyssal seafloor by two orders of magnitude.

This waste has been accumulating for decades. The team found an old package for steak from 1984 that still appeared visually intact, with vivid colors. And because plastic takes so long to biodegrade, particularly in the ocean, this waste is unlikely to go anywhere any time soon and the pile will only continue to increase in size as the current keeps moving.

""Plastic debris on the deep seafloor will most likely persist for at least a century,"" Nakajima said.

The team is now planning to look for plastics in the other recirculation gyre of the Kuroshio current, which is located south of Japan. The researchers also hope that their work will encourage others to search for missing plastic in the oceans around Asia.

""The journey to find 'missing plastics' has just begun,"" Nakajima said. ""Further investigations into the deep-sea floor lie downward of ocean currents sourced from the massive waste producers of Asian countries will cut through the mystery of the missing plastics.""

0,No Clear Option For Montenegro As It Tries To Repay $1 Billion Highway Debt To China,https://www.rferl.org/a/montenegro-china-billion-debt-highway/31203309.html,"PODGORICA -- Montenegro says it needs help from the European Union to pay off a whopping $1 billion Chinese loan for a controversial road project that has left the Balkan country in a dire financial situation.

But EU spokeswoman Ana Pisonero told RFE/RL that the bloc ""does not repay loans from third parties,"" though she added that Brussels did have concerns over ""the socioeconomic and financial effects some of China's investments can have,"" as well as the risks of economic imbalances and ""debt dependency.""

She did say, however, that the EU was willing to offer support through its $10 billion Economic and Investment Plan for the Western Balkans. ""The Economic and Investment plan will help leverage funding from other public and private investors, including from the European Investment Bank at very favorable conditions,"" Pisonero said.

The long-delayed and still-incomplete highway finds itself at the heart of a wider geopolitical contest on the EU's doorstep, where China's influence in the Balkans has expanded dramatically in recent years.

The rebuffed call to Brussels for assistance comes as Montenegro faces a looming repayment deadline for the highway -- which is being built by the China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) -- and is grappling with a host of political and financial challenges, including a tourism-dependent economy that has contracted significantly due to the pandemic and weakened its repayment ability.

China holds approximately one-quarter of Montenegro's total debt, which reached 103 percent of GDP last year, and if Podgorica defaults on its loan the contract for the road project gives China the possibility to access land and assets in the Balkan country as collateral.

According to the current contract with the Export-Import Bank of China, the first loan payments are due in July.

The stakes are now high for both Brussels and Podgorica.

Montenegro must now search for other options for its financial future, while the EU must look for a way to shore up its standing in the Western Balkans, a region where China continues to improve its ties amid the pandemic by strategically donating vaccines and providing aid in a time of crisis.

""It's not a surprise to see where the project ended up, it was trouble in the making from the start,"" Vuk Vuksanovic, a researcher at the Belgrade Center for Security Policy, told RFE/RL.

Debt Politics

With debt help from the EU not on the table, the new Montenegrin government that was narrowly voted into power in December must find a new solution. The loan was taken out by a previous government led by current President Milo Djukanovic, who continues to be a long-term force in the country's politics.

Montenegro, which became an independent country again when it broke away from Serbia in 2006, joined NATO in 2017 and is working to get the green light to join the EU. Like many countries in the Balkans, it also has strong ties to Russia and has increasingly looked to China -- under the guise of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative -- for infrastructure and investment.

The current government of Prime Minister Zdravko Krivokapic has tried to distance itself from the highway project, raising concerns over being able to meet its debt obligations and tying the loan to its predecessors, who signed the deal in 2014.

Deputy Prime Minister Dritan Abazovic first publicly raised concerns in March, when he told Montenegrin lawmakers that the EU should help refinance the loan to protect the country from becoming dependent on China.

Montenegrin Finance Minister Milojko Spajic also joined the public effort, telling the Financial Times on April 11 that the EU helping the country with the Chinese loan was an ""easy win"" and ""low-hanging fruit"" for the bloc.

A Winding Road

Accepting the loan from the Export-Import Bank of China and building the highway was controversial from the very start. The project was designed to link the port of Bar on Montenegro's Adriatic coast to landlocked neighbor Serbia. The highway itself is divided into three sections, with the Chinese loan only covering the first 41 kilometers.

That stretch, which passes through mountains north of the capital, has been the most demanding, with an estimated 60 percent of it made up of bridges and tunnels. The first section of the highway is not yet completed, having faced planning problems and delays due to the pandemic. The government recently said it intended for the first section to be complete this year.

When the current government was the opposition it criticized the government for agreeing to the loan, raising concerns over the cost, a lack of transparency in the tender process, potential corruption, and the long-term economic risk it brought to the small Balkan country of 620,000.

Doubts about the highway first surfaced after two feasibility studies, conducted in 2006 and 2012, showed it was not economically viable. Montenegro had tried and failed to secure funding from European sources before it turned to China.

""Some projects haven't been built for a reason,"" Jonathan Hillman, the director of the Reconnecting Asia Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told RFE/RL. ""Just because financing becomes available it doesn't mean that it should be accepted.""

MANS, an EU-financed anti-corruption watchdog, also pressed the government at the time to provide lawmakers with data to support its vision and how the project would generate revenue before a vote to approve the Chinese-funded highway in 2014. But the government refused to do so and many details around the contract for the loan remain hidden.

Even before the current problems posed by the debt repayment deadline, the Chinese loan caused economic pain to the country, forcing the government to raise taxes and partially freeze public-sector wages in order to get its finances in order.

Because the government did not hedge against currency swings and failed to include a turnpike in its original plans, the cost of the project continued to soar, pointing to a looming debt problem. The highway itself proved to be extremely expensive, with an average estimated cost of $23.8 million per kilometer.

In 2018, the Center for Global Development, a Washington-based think tank, listed Montenegro as one of eight countries at risk of a debt crisis after receiving a Chinese loan.

""The risks around this highway were clear at the beginning,"" Hillman said. ""This shows what can happen when there isn't proper accountability and effective oversight for these big infrastructure projects.""

China In The Balkans

In addition to the economic problems it poses to Montenegro, the current saga also puts the EU in a difficult position in regard to China in the region.

China continues to loom large in the Balkans, deepening its footprint through infrastructure and energy projects. Beijing has also begun to build up stronger political ties in the region, forging a comprehensive partnership with Serbia that has allowed it to expand out to neighboring countries.

Montenegro is potentially attractive to China for a number of reasons. It gives Beijing a European presence on the Adriatic coast and closer political ties and heightened influence within the country could prove useful if Podgorica joins the EU.

For Brussels, how it decides to navigate this situation will impact its credibility in the Balkans, which has been negatively affected during the pandemic over problematic episodes involving the supply of medical equipment and vaccines.

Still, the EU is the region's top investor and main market and is exploring other avenues to assist Podgorica.

On April 12, French European Affairs Minister Clement Beaune tweeted that Paris was working with the European Commission to find a solution to Montenegro's debt problem and ""reduce the dependence on China in the Balkans.""

""This is a rare opportunity for the EU to step up in its backyard and push back against China,"" Vuksanovic said.

""But it also wouldn't be the first strategic opportunity that the bloc has squandered in the Balkans,"" he added. ""Doing so would be a bad signal to the region and a green light to Beijing.""

0,Covid variant first detected in India is found in the UK | Coronavirus,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/15/covid-variant-first-detected-india-found-uk,"A coronavirus variant with potentially worrying mutations that was first detected in India has been found in the UK.

In total, 77 cases of the variant, known as B.1.617, have been recorded in the UK up to 14 April, according to the latest update from Public Health England (PHE), released on Thursday. Of these, 73 were recorded in England and four in Scotland.

It was the first time PHE had reported the variant in the UK.

It currently has the label “variant under investigation”. If worries about it are borne out, for example if it appears to be more infectious or more resistant to the body’s immune response, then it may be designated a “variant of concern”.

The UK has a handful of “variants of concern”, including ones first detected in Kent, South Africa and Brazil.

These variants contain a different overall set of mutations, although there are some overlaps. For example all three have a mutation called N501Y, which is believed to make the virus more infectious, while the Brazil and South Africa variants both have a mutation called 484K, which is believed to help the virus at least partially evade the body’s immune responses towards coronavirus – including those produced by some Covid vaccines. This mutation later cropped up in the Kent variant, giving rise to a new variant of concern.

The B.1.617 variant was first detected in India, but has since been found elsewhere, including California. It has worried experts as it contains two mutations in the spike protein that, it has been suggested, may boost its ability to escape the body’s immune responses. It is thought the variant may also be able to infect the body more easily.

Prof Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the arrival of the India variant was potentially worrying.

“These two escape mutations working together could be a lot more problematic than the South African and Brazilian variants who have only got one escape mutation,” he said. “It might be even less controlled by vaccine than the Brazilian and South African variants.”

However, more research is needed to explore the role of these mutations and the impact they might have.

News of the arrival of the India variant in the UK came as surge testing was expanded in London in an attempt to control the spread of coronavirus variants, with parts of Hillingdon, as well as certain postcodes in Lambeth, Wandsworth, Southwark and Barnet all having testing and contact tracing ramped up. Sandwell council in the West Midlands has also announced it will undertake surge testing.

India is experiencing a devastating wave of coronavirus, although it is not clear whether the B.1.617 variant is helping to fuel the surge. Boris Johnson is expected to travel to India later this month, although his trip has been curtailed as a result of the infections there.

Prof Christina Pagel, director of the Clinical Operational Research Unit at University College London and a member of the Independent Sage group of experts, said the discovery of the variant in the UK was worrying, and tweeted that Johnson should not head to Delhi.

“We don’t know yet whether it can escape existing vaccines but it has several concerning mutations,” she told the Guardian. “It is ridiculous that India is not on the travel red list yet – or many other countries for that matter – when India is seeing 200,000 new cases every day at the moment.”",576,3405,13,70
0,British families took bigger hit to income during Covid pandemic than Europeans,https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2021/apr/18/british-families-took-bigger-hit-to-income-than-european-households,"British households were plunged into the Covid pandemic with lower savings, more debt and weaker welfare support than their French and German counterparts, according to analysis revealing how inequality increased the impact of the UK crisis.

High levels of income inequality also weakened the financial resilience of poorer households as the pandemic hit. The greater exposure of British households, revealed in an analysis by the Resolution Foundation thinktank to be published in full this week, comes despite similar levels of average income with our European neighbours.

The typical working-age income level in the UK is £29,437 and £29,350 in France. However, the poorest fifth of working-age households in the UK are 20% poorer than their French counterparts, while the richest fifth are 17% richer in Britain.

The structure of Britain’s economy and income inequality is seen by some as a reason for the heavy toll the pandemic had wrought on the UK. Some public health officials continue to warn that incidences of the virus remain higher in areas with many people in low-paid work and where they cannot work from home. There have been warnings that it could become a “disease of the poor” in some areas.

High employment levels in the UK helped household finances in the run-up to the pandemic last year, with a 75% employment rate – broadly similar to that in Germany and far higher than the 66% record in France. However, the typical hourly rate paid in the UK (£11.20) was much lower than in Germany (£12.33) and France (£13.89). It was partly driven by low self-employed earnings, raising further concerns about the extent of the gig economy in Britain.

Levels of UK welfare support were found to be poor in comparison with other large European nations, underlining the importance of protecting jobs through the government’s emergency furlough scheme rolled out last year. For example, a single adult who had been out of work for two months, having previously earned two-thirds of the average wage, would see their benefit income total just 17% of their previous earnings. The same person would see a benefit replacement rate of 59% in Germany and 64% in France. The gap is closed when housing-related benefits are included, with the UK’s benefit replacement rate rising to 46%, compared with 59% in Germany and 68% in France.

Household savings before the pandemic were lower in the UK than in France and Germany. Two-thirds of low-income households in Britain have savings that amount to less than one month’s disposable income. The figure in France and Germany is 56%.

However, average housing costs are higher in Germany than in France and the UK because of high levels of private renting, particularly for the low-paid. The precarious position of some households in Britain compared with their European counterparts came despite much higher housing wealth.

Overall, the study found that the combination of lower incomes at the bottom level of British earners, comparatively low levels of private savings, and a less generous social security safety net meant that UK households were “particularly exposed to economic shocks – such as the Covid-19 crisis that countries across the world have experienced over the past 12 months.”

Dan Tomlinson, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Typical household incomes across the UK, France and Germany are broadly similar. But their saving and spending patterns are quite different – and this means that UK households in particular have gone into the Covid-19 crisis with far less financial security than their European counterparts.”

He added: “High levels of inequality in the UK mean our low-income families are poorer, have fewer savings and are more likely to have financial debt. And although UK households have more housing wealth and are more likely to work than households in France, the level of support available if they lose their jobs is far weaker.",640,3942,12,79

Originally, we were hoping this was a sign of a comeback, but it turns out things are looking rather dire. This may be even worse than when money began fading slowly out of existence in 2008. At this rate, we fear that there may be no cash left by the end of Q3.” At press time, White urged Americans not to withdraw any money from their bank accounts, as they might suffocate in the sheer amount of ash.

0,Brexit pushes 440 financial services firms to move some U.K. business to Europe,https://www.pionline.com/brexit/brexit-pushes-440-financial-services-firms-move-some-uk-business-europe,"Almost 450 U.K. financial services firms, including 92 investment managers, have relocated to other European cities or beefed up European presence due to the U.K.'s withdrawal from the European Union.

Money managers and insurance firms have also transferred more than £100 billion ($138.3 billion) in assets to Europe as a result of the U.K.'s withdrawal from the European Union.

Analysis by U.K. think tank New Financial found that, as of this month, 440 U.K. financial services firms have relocated to or increased resources in Europe, compared with 269 in a 2019 analysis.

Among the firms moving parts of their business to the EU were 65 money managers and 27 alternative investment firms. A comparative figure for 2019 was not available.

One-third of all money management firms that have relocated part of their business to Europe as a result of Brexit chose to move to Dublin, followed by 19 firms that moved to Luxembourg, 13 firms that moved to Paris, seven firms that moved to Frankfurt and five firms that moved to Amsterdam.

Among alternative investment firms moving to Europe, 10 relocated parts of the business to Luxembourg, nine chose Dublin, five chose Paris, two firms selected Frankfurt and one firm chose Amsterdam.

Firms have also been forced to secure European licenses in order to continue to service European clients from the U.K., amid a lack of agreement on financial services equivalence.

The shift in business, assets and legal entities will gradually chip away at the U.K.'s influence in the banking and finance industry in Europe and around the world, as a greater proportion of business is authorized by and conducted in the EU, New Financial said.

Across all financial services firms, 135 chose to relocate some of their business to Dublin, followed by 102 firms choosing Paris, 93 selecting Luxembourg, 62 opting for Frankfurt and 48 choosing Amsterdam.

Over the longer term, New Financial expects Frankfurt to lead relocation rankings by assets, while Paris will lead by the number of jobs moved. Details on the current rankings and breakdowns were not available.

The firm also identified £900 billion in bank assets, which constitutes around 10% of the entire U.K. banking system, that have been or are being moved out of the U.K. as a result of Brexit as of April. Bank assets that were estimated to have left or that were due to leave the U.K. stood at £800 billion in 2019.

The firm also said there have been 7,400 staff moves or local hires in response to Brexit, which New Financial expects to increase over the next few years.

However, the U.K. is still expected to attract smaller firms to its shores. New Financial expects between 300 and 500 smaller firms to set up a new U.K. office over the next few years.

0,Japanese Prime Minister Challenged to Drink Radioactive Water Before Dumping It Into the Ocean,https://futurism.com/the-byte/japanese-prime-minister-challenged-drink-radioactive-water-dumping-ocean,"""So then please drink it.""

Shots Shots Shots

Last week, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga announced that the government could no longer delay its plan to dump radioactive water from the destroyed Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the ocean.

The Japanese government has repeatedly insisted that the plan won’t put biodiversity or people in the area at risk, but plenty of residents of Japan and neighboring countries are reasonably concerned about the dump. Now, the Chinese government is demanding dramatic proof that the water is safe, Japanese newspaper The Mainichi reports.

“A Japanese official said it is okay if we drink this water, so then please drink it,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told reporters on Wednesday, according to the paper.

Big Talk

Japan is already capable of purifying Fukushima’s contaminated water to a certain extent, but it can’t scrub out the radioactive tritium. The plan, however, is to dilute the water down so it contains just 2.5 percent of the tritium concentration permitted by its national standards before dumping it over the course of decades. But still, drinking it straight from the source sounds a bit dicey.

Lijian has since doubled down on the challenge.

“Japanese politicians said treated [waste water] is ‘innocent’, why don’t they drink, cook and wash clothes with the water first?” he tweeted on Thursday. “They should guarantee sea food won’t be contaminated; accept the advice of [The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)] and set up a technical working group with China and [Korea] to make assessment.”

However, it’s worth noting that the IAEA came out in support of Japan’s plan before Lijian issued his challenge.

“The Japanese Government’s decision is in line with practice globally,” IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano said in a press release, “even though the large amount of water at the Fukushima plant makes it a unique and complex case.”

Crack British troops are ready to head to Ukraine “within hours” amid fears of a Russian invasion.

Around 450 Paras are poised to drop into eastern Europe should the current crisis worsen.

The elite soldiers from 16 Air Assault Brigade conducted a practice jump last year as tensions began to rise, and they could be in the region within 36 hours.

A senior defence chief said: “It’s a waiting game, but all indications suggest Russia is days away from mounting an invasion.

“The Paras could deploy very quickly – this is what they are trained for and they are itching to get involved.”

Vladimir Putin has amassed more than 95,000 troops along Russia’s border with east Ukraine, which is under the control of Russia- backed rebels. Russian warships are heading to the Caspian Sea.

A five-nation alliance known as the Quint – the UK, US, Canada, Lithuania and Poland – is backing Ukraine and stated that it would “continue to call on Russia to de-escalate”.

The US has announced the deployment of two warships to the Black Sea in an attempt to shore up Ukrainian resistance to the Russians.

Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy flew into the contested Donbass region and spoke to troops entrenched there against potential military action from Russian-backed rebels.

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said our military had trained more than 20,000 Ukrainian troops, adding: “Our Armed Forces continue to support Ukraine.”

In Russia, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov warned the situation in eastern Ukraine was “very unstable” and made it clear that Russian army personnel were ready to step in to protect the interests of Russian-speaking residents of Ukraine.

MOSCOW -- Russia’s main security agency says it has arrested two Belarusians who it said were preparing a plot to overthrow Belarus’ government and kill authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko.

One of the men arrested, Aleksandr Feduta, was Lukahsenko’s spokesman when he was first elected in 1994, but later joined the opposition. The other, lawyer Yuras Zyankovich, has dual Belarusian-U.S. citizenship.

The Federal Security Service said Saturday that the two have been handed over to Belarus. Russian authorities were alerted to information about the men’s plans by the Belarusian security service, the KGB.

The Russian agency said the two suspects came to Moscow to meet with opposition-minded Belarusian generals, whom they told that “for the successful implementation of their plan, it was necessary to physically eliminate practically the entire top leadership of the republic.""

""They detailed the plan for a military coup, in particular, including the seizure of radio and television centers to broadcast their appeal to the people, blocking the internal troops and riot police units loyal to the current government,” the Russian agency said.

Lukashenko told Belarusian television Saturday that investigators found evidence of foreign involvement in the alleged plot, “most likely the FBI, the CIA.”

After nationwide protests against Lukashenko broke out last year after his disputed election win, he repeatedly blamed Western countries for allegedly plotting his downfall or even preparing for a military intervention.

The protests, some of which attracted as many as 200,000 people, started in August after an election that official results say gave Lukashenko a sixth term in office. Opposition members and even some poll workers said the results were fraudulent.

Security forces then cracked down hard on the demonstrations, arresting more than 34,000 people, many of whom were beaten. Most prominent opposition figures have fled Belarus or have since been jailed.",325,2176,7,48

0,"Google misled consumers over location data settings, Australia court finds",https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/google-misled-consumers-over-location-data-settings-australia-court-finds/,"Google’s historical collection of location data has got it into hot water in Australia where a case brought by the country’s Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has led to a federal court ruling that the tech giant misled consumers by operating a confusing dual-layer of location settings in what the regulator describes as a “world-first enforcement action”.

The case relates to personal location data collected by Google through Android mobile devices between January 2017 and December 2018.

Per the ACCC, the court ruled that “when consumers created a new Google Account during the initial set-up process of their Android device, Google misrepresented that the ‘Location History’ setting was the only Google Account setting that affected whether Google collected, kept or used personally identifiable data about their location”.

“In fact, another Google Account setting titled ‘Web & App Activity’ also enabled Google to collect, store and use personally identifiable location data when it was turned on, and that setting was turned on by default,” it wrote.

The Court also ruled that Google misled consumers when they later accessed the ‘Location History’ setting on their Android device during the same time period to turn that setting off because it did not inform them that by leaving the ‘Web & App Activity’ setting switched on, Google would continue to collect, store and use their personally identifiable location data.

“Similarly, between 9 March 2017 and 29 November 2018, when consumers later accessed the ‘Web & App Activity’ setting on their Android device, they were misled because Google did not inform them that the setting was relevant to the collection of personal location data,” the ACCC added.

Similar complaints about Google’s location data processing being deceptive — and allegations that it uses manipulative tactics in order to keep tracking web users’ locations for ad-targeting purposes — have been raised by consumer agencies in Europe for years. And in February 2020 the company’s lead data regulator in the region finally opened an investigation. However, that probe remains ongoing.

Whereas the ACCC said today that it will be seeking “declarations, pecuniary penalties, publications orders, and compliance orders” following the federal court ruling. Although it added that the specifics of its enforcement action will be determined “at a later date”. So it’s not clear exactly when Google will be hit with an order — nor how large a fine it might face.

The tech giant may also seek to appeal the court ruling.

Google said today it’s reviewing its legal options and considering a “possible appeal” — highlighting the fact the Court did not agree wholesale with the ACCC’s case because it dismissed some of the allegations (related to certain statements Google made about the methods by which consumers could prevent it from collecting and using their location data, and the purposes for which personal location data was being used by Google).

Here’s Google’s statement in full:

The court rejected many of the ACCC’s broad claims. We disagree with the remaining findings and are currently reviewing our options, including a possible appeal. We provide robust controls for location data and are always looking to do more — for example we recently introduced auto delete options for Location History, making it even easier to control your data.

While Mountain View denies doing anything wrong in how it configures location settings — while simultaneously claiming it’s always looking to improve the controls it offers its users — Google’s settings and defaults have, nonetheless, got it into hot water with regulators before.

Back in 2019 France’s data watchdog, the CNIL, fined it $57 million over a number of transparency and consent failures under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation. That remains the largest GDPR penalty issued to a tech giant since the regulation came into force a little less than three years ago — although France has more recently sanctioned Google $120 million under different EU laws for dropping tracking cookies without consent.

Australia, meanwhile, has forged ahead with passing legislation this year that directly targets the market power of Google (and Facebook) — passing a mandatory news media bargaining code in February which aims to address the power imbalance between platform giants and publishers around the reuse of journalism content.",700,4439,10,74

0,German Hospitals Near Breaking Point With Cases Still Rising,https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/german-hospitals-near-breaking-point-with-cases-still-rising/ar-BB1fG2Xm?ocid=uxbndlbing,"(Bloomberg) -- Germany’s health-care system is getting stretched to the brink, with many hospitals overwhelmed with Covid-19 patients and rising case numbers pointing to tougher days ahead.

The occupancy rate in intensive-care units rose to 88% on Wednesday, the highest in more than a year, and remained near that level on Thursday.

Some hospitals need to “significantly reduce” elective procedures and relocate stable patients to other parts of the country to cope, said Lothar Wieler, head of Germany’s Robert Koch Institute public health agency.

“The situation is getting dramatically worse,” Wieler said at a press conference as Germany reported 31,117 new coronavirus cases, the most since mid-January.

Only about 17% of the country’s population has received at least one Covid shot, and it could be months before a majority gets vaccinated. Meanwhile, the more transmissible virus variant that was first identified in the U.K. now accounts for about 90% of new cases, according to Wieler.

J&J Delay Slows Vaccine Rollout Across a World Needing Shots

The group getting hit hardest is aged 15 to 49, although case numbers are even climbing again in people over 90 years old, Wieler said.

The situation in hospitals is particularly bad in places because there aren’t enough doctors and nurses, he said.

“I appeal once more on all decision-makers: we need a drastic reduction in contacts now,” Wieler said. Only then should policymakers figure out how to safely reopen parts of the economy, he said.

Wieler also pointed out that perhaps as many as 10% of patients will suffer months-long effects, also requiring more medical attention.

He likened the state of the pandemic in Germany to driving along a narrow, twisting mountain road with a steep cliff to one side. Driving too fast -- rather than moving along at a prudent pace -- heightens the risk of careening into the precipice, he said.

“It’s life threatening,” Wieler said. “Honestly, no emergency brake can help you anymore.”

0,Hijab regulations: Two women's experience,https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-56773815,"Nadya and Emna grew up nearly 12,000 km away from each other but they share one important experience.

They have both been told what they can and can’t wear by the people around them, based on their religion.

In Indonesia, many politicians argue that the jilbab, a kind of hijab, is mandatory in Islam and that Muslim girls should be forced to wear it from a young age. A new decree allows for students or teachers to now wear whatever they want in school, but not every place enforces this; Nadya grew up having to wear it at school, and was expected to continue doing so afterwards by her family.

In France, the opposite conversation is happening, with a new bill that is stopping minors from wearing conspicuous religious clothing at school, and the hijab receiving widespread media attention in a country where secularism is celebrated. Growing up, Emna felt that lots of people in French society had misconceptions around the hijab as a result.

REUTERS/Bruno Kelly

Very little of today’s world resembles Planet Earth from 500 years ago. In fact, only about 3% of land surfaces might be ecologically intact -- still home to their full range of native species and unblemished by human activity, according to new research.

The finding -- published Thursday in the journal Frontiers in Forests and Global Change -- is far lower than previous estimates based on satellite images, which suggested around 20% to 40% of land ecosystems were undamaged.

For the new study, however, scientists conducted an extensive survey of forest cover and species losses to understand better what was happening beneath the world’s tree canopies.

""I was particularly surprised to see how low it really is,"" said Andrew Plumptre, a conservation biologist at the University of Cambridge. ""It shows how rare such intact places are. It's scary just how little the world looks like what it was just 500 years ago.""

The term ecosystem describes the complex relationships within a natural area that, altogether, help to sustain a healthy and balanced diversity of life. Lose just one or two key species, and the whole system could fall apart.

Today’s still-pristine habitats, containing the same species abundance as in the year 1500 A.D., were mostly found in regions considered less hospitable for humans, including the Sahara Desert and chilly regions of Greenland and northern Canada.

Other intact habitats were in areas under extreme pressure from deforestation and development, including parts of the Amazon in Latin America.

The authors argue that these areas should be a priority for future conservation. Though currently, only 11% of these areas are under protection, the study found.

""The idea of focusing on intact areas is so that you don’t have to work to remove the human footprint,"" Plumptre said.

Some scientists, however, questioned the extremely low figure, saying it could be attributed to the study using a particularly narrow definition of ""intact habitats"" -- those with their full, historical collection of animals and plants.

""We need practical actions to ensure species and ecosystems survive,"" said Stuart Pimm, a conservation scientist at Duke University.

He also questioned the study authors' call for protecting still-intact areas, noting frozen or desert patches are not the most abundant with species. ""Encouraging nations to protect remote, sparsely populated areas won't do biodiversity a lot of good,"" Pimm said.

An effort led by the United Nations to protect 30% of the planet’s land and waters by 2030 - up from about 17% currently under some form of protection - has gained momentum over the last year, as governments including the United States have pledged to commit more land to conservation.

Some conservationists argue, however, that the world’s conservation goal should be much higher than 30% in order to prevent mass die-offs of species. A 2019 U.N. report estimated as many as 1 million species are under threat of extinction due to human activity.

“30 by 30 is a nice catchphrase, but it won’t do much good if the areas to be protected are not selected carefully,” Pimm said.

0,Europe has surpassed one million COVID-19 deaths: WHO,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/15/europe-has-surpassed-one-million-covid-19-deaths-who,"UN health agency warns of a ‘serious’ situation in the region as infections soar to record levels in some nations.

A top official from the World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday said Europe had surpassed one million deaths from COVID-19 and warned the situation remains “serious” in the region, with about 1.6 million new cases reported there each week.

The comments by WHO Regional Director for Europe Hans Kluge aimed to emphasise that Europe must keep up its guard with social distancing and speed up vaccinations as virus variants drive new infections to record levels in some nations.

Overall, a tally by Johns Hopkins University shows nearly three million deaths have been linked to COVID-19 worldwide – with the Americas hardest hit, followed by Europe. The United States, Brazil and Mexico have reported the highest number of deaths, collectively at more than 1.1 million.

Speaking to reporters during a visit to Greece, Kluge did point to “early signs that transmission may be slowing across several countries” in WHO’s 53-country European region, which stretches into Central Asia, and cited “declining incidence” among the oldest people.

He said the proportion of COVID-19 deaths among people over 80, who have been prioritised for vaccines, had dropped to nearly 30 percent – the lowest level in the pandemic.

The United Kingdom in particular has seen new infections and COVID-19 deaths drop dramatically since January, due to a successful vaccination program and a prolonged national lockdown that is only being reversed in stages.

Addressing recent concerns about vaccines, Kluge also said the risk of people suffering blood clots is far higher for people with COVID-19 than for people who receive AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine.

“Let there be no doubt about it, the AstraZeneca vaccine is effective in reducing COVID-19 hospitalisation and preventing deaths,” he said, adding that WHO recommends its use for all eligible adults.",309,1959,8,53
0,"China, Russia using their COVID-19 vaccines to gain political influence, experts say",https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/china-russia-using-their-covid-19-vaccines-to-gain-political-influence-experts-say-1.5391422,"OTTAWA -- China and Russia have been using their locally produced COVID-19 vaccines to grow their international soft power by giving doses to desperate countries in order to have more political influence over them, experts say.

Benjamin Gedan, deputy director of the Latin America program at the Wilson Center in Washington, called the practice ""vaccine diplomacy,"" noting that it happens when countries seek to grow their international prestige by distributing vaccines to nations that need them.

He said authoritarian governments, including those in China and Russia, have taken the lead in vaccine diplomacy in the last months.

""It's never encouraging to see the world's largest dictatorships taking most advantage of this diplomatic opportunity,"" Gedan said.

The China National Pharmaceutical Group Corp., Sinopharm, is producing two COVID-19 vaccines while Sinovac, a Beijing-based biopharmaceutical company, is making a third one.

Gedan said while China had offered bilateral loans of US$1 billion in Latin America, it refused to give COVID-19 vaccines to Paraguay, which recognizes Taiwan diplomatically.

""There have been reports from the foreign minister of Paraguay that intermediaries of the Chinese government explicitly said that Paraguay will not access the Chinese vaccine unless it changes its position on Taiwan,"" he said.

He added there have been reports that Brazil, which is suffering one of the world's worst COVID-19 outbreaks, could not access Chinese vaccines without committing to allow Chinese telecommunications company Huawei from accessing its 5G wireless network auction.

Lynette Ong, an associate political science professor at the University Of Toronto, said China has donated or sold its COVID-19 vaccine to almost all southeast Asian countries.

""It usually comes with some sort of strings attached,"" she said.

""There's definitely vaccine diplomacy going on quite aggressively by China.""

China's vaccine diplomacy is not as effective as its personal-protective equipment diplomacy was last year, Ong said.

She said China was the only major producer of personal protective equipment last year while it's competing now with many other countries that are producing different types of COVID-19 vaccines.

""China was not the first (country) to have the vaccine produced and manufactured,"" she said.

Ong said China has invested a lot in boosting its soft power in developing countries from Latin America, Africa and southeast Asia, but it has also received a lot of pushback.

""There is so much pushback against Huawei just because it is a Chinese brand, right, not because people have found evidence that we can squarely put Huawei in the category of espionage,"" she said.

Aurel Braun, a Russian foreign policy professor at the University of Toronto, said Russia has been pushing particular political agendas and integrating vaccine diplomacy as a much more significant element of its foreign policy than China.

""China is much wealthier, has a far larger economy than Russia. It is able to provide all kinds of other economic benefits. Providing the vaccine is one of many options that they have,"" he said.

""(For Russia,) The Sputnik V (vaccine) is a much more important tool, and they have been especially focusing in certain parts of Europe or where leaders have been more sympathetic to Mr. Putin's policy ... like Viktor Orban in Hungary or in Slovakia.""

Jillian Kohler, a pharmacy and public health professor at the University of Toronto, said China and Russia saw an opportunity in the lack of COVID-19 vaccine supply, and they are taking advantage of that to further their political goals.

""If ... Russia or China aren't actually asking for something explicitly, there's an implicit bargain happening here,"" she said.

""Countries are turning to Russia and China because they're desperate, so when you do that, I mean, you're in a position of weakness, and when you're in a position of weakness that might mean at some point that you're going to have to compensate for that.""

Gedan, the Washington-based Wilson Center expert, said the United States may soon share its supply of COVID-19 vaccines globally, which would limit China and Russia's ability to influence other countries using their supplies.

""I think we're rapidly approaching the moment where the United States will be able to play a major role in the global vaccination campaign,"" he said.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently named Gayle Smith, who headed the US Agency for International Development under former president Barack Obama, to a new position as the U.S. coordinator for global COVID-19 response to support a worldwide effort to inoculate against the novel coronavirus.

Gedan said the United States has made some efforts to be helpful by committing US$4 billion to COVAX, a World Health Organization program, and by sending Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine shipments to Mexico and Canada.

But these efforts are going to be more significant soon when the U.S begins exporting more of its Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, he said.

He said the United States is planning to do most of its vaccine distributions through COVAX, which means they will get distributed to both friendly governments and adversarial countries.

""(The U.S. approach is) to distribute vaccines in a way that reflects, you know, public health needs and not foreign policy goals,"" he said.

Most countries are not only struggling with a lack of capacity to produce vaccines locally but also with a lack of resources to procure vaccines from the companies that are making them, he said.

He said the lack of a local capacity to produce vaccines has slowed Canada's vaccination campaign, but Canada has been able to purchase an extraordinary number of doses.

""Eventually, Canada will likely be exporting some of these vaccines that it has purchased that are above and beyond its local need.""

Australian Border Force officers searched the 22-year-old Chinese national’s Toorak home on Thursday and seized child sex doll parts, including a silicone lower torso, items of infant clothing, and a flesh-like apparatus with childlike appearance.

Officers also seized six mobile phones and several computers.

Tensions between the two nations have risen after Ukrainian diplomats called Russia’s growing army “the largest troop movement since the Second World War”. US President Joe Biden issued a warning on Thursday, urging Russian President Vladimir Putin to de-escalate tensions and “refrain from military action.”

In a statement, Mr Biden said: “If Russia continues to interfere with our democracy, I’m prepared to take further actions to respond. “Now is the time to de-escalate.” The US cancelled deployment of two warships to the Black Sea on April 14 in order to avoid an unnecessary escalation of the situation. The Kremlin had previously warned US warships to steer clear of Crimea “for their own good” and has closed part of the Kerch Strait in an attempt to block foreign warships from reaching Ukraine.

General Tod Wolters, the top US military chief in Europe, warned on Thursday that there is a “low to medium” risk that Russia will invade Ukraine over the next few weeks. Three Ukrainian gunboats were almost forced to fire on Russian vessels on Thursday in the Azov sea after enemy ships performed “provocative manoeuvres.” Andrii Klymenko, a Ukrainian commentator, said: “Our sailors had to warn they were ready to use weapons.” The Ukrainian Government forecasts that around 40,000 troops and a plethora of advanced military-grade equipment has been amassed in Crimea and another 40,000 close to the Eastern Border.

0,Students evacuate Cape Town university as fire damages historic buildings,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/19/cape-town-fire-table-mountain-evacuate-university-jagger-library,"A wildfire raging on the slopes of Cape Town’s Table Mountain has spread to the University of Cape Town, burning the historic campus library and forcing the evacuation of 4,000 students.

Orange flames lit up the windows of the library, which houses considerable archives and book collections while firefighters sprayed jets of water to douse the blaze.

The reading room at the university’s historic Jagger library was “gutted” according to UCT Library executive director Ujala Satgoor, but the fire detection system was triggered, “preventing the spread of the fire to other parts of the library.” Some valuable collections had been lost, she said.

Other campus buildings also caught fire, and a historic windmill nearby burned. The thatch-roofed Mostert’s Mill, built in 1796, is the country’s oldest working windmill.

Just off-campus on the slopes of Table Mountain, wind spread the flames across dry brush, and part of the Rhodes Memorial Restaurant caught fire, Cape Town media reported. SANParks, which runs Table Mountain national park, said it believed that the fire had been started accidentally by a homeless person.

Dan Plato, mayor of the City of Cape Town, said, “It is tragic that literary treasures have been lost at the UCT library, but I have been informed that some of the most valuable works were saved by the quick activation of roller doors. Our attention and support remains with firefighters and all role players working to protect further loss of property.”

More than 100 firefighters and emergency personnel were deployed to the university campus and to Table Mountain national park. Four helicopters were being used to drop water on threatened areas, officials said.

One firefighter was injured and being treated at a hospital, according to the Cape Town fire and rescue department.

Table Mountain national park fire manager Philip Prins said in a statement that the fire had spread particularly rapidly because of the mountain’s “very old pine trees and their debris. The fire created its own wind that further increased the rate of spread”.

“The excessive amount of smoke and related updrafts made it impossible for the aerial support to slow the spread.”

Residents have been cautioned to be on alert, Charlotte Powell, spokesperson for the city’s disaster risk management centre, said in a statement.

“At this stage, there’s no cause to evacuate, but we ask that residents adhere to the following: close all windows to prevent draft and reduce heat, damp down your garden using a hose or irrigation system,” Powell said.

Images of library buildings burning from the inside alarmed students, academics, writers and artists – some of whom have stored archival materials in the libraries.

Satgoor said that despite the fire detection system protecting much of the library, “some of our valuable collections have been lost, however a full assessment can only be done once the building has been declared safe”.

“I write this message with a deep sense of sorrow and devastation at the loss,” Satgoor wrote in a statement posted to Twitter. “Some of us watched, from on site, with horror and helplessness this elegant and historical library burn”. A restoration of the Jagger reading room began in 2011, according to the library’s website.

The Jagger library houses the university’s Special Collections library, which houses priceless archival material, including rare books, manuscripts, photographs and documents such as anti-Apartheid pamphlets. Some of these have been digitised.

Table Mountain national park called on social media for hikers to leave the area and for motorists to remove cars parked in the vicinity.

A first alert went up shortly before 9am (0700 GMT), city authorities said.

Three helicopters joined the fight, dumping water on the inferno, they added.

The University’s vice-chancellor, Prof Mamokgethi Phakeng, said in a statement that “all academic activities will be suspended [Monday] and on Tuesday”. Food and accommodation had been provided for all evacuated students, she said, and arrangements had been made to accommodate Muslim students, who are fasting for Ramadan.

Her comments come as NATO and the United States announced the withdrawal of their troops from Afghanistan this year, prompting fears that some Afghans could now be in danger after helping foreign forces.

German troops are deployed to the country as part of NATO's Resolute Support mission to train the Afghan National Defence forces.

How could Germany help?

A procedure for admitting local Afghan staff who need refuge already exists, although there are a number of disputed cases.

According to the Defense Ministry, 781 people have been approved for residency since 2013.

Kramp-Karrenbauer wants the existing process to be streamlined and accelerated, the news agency said.

The Welt am Sonntag newspaper, citing the Interior Ministry, reported that Germany plans to set up an office in Kabul and probably also one in Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan to help process cases.

'A deep obligation'

""We are talking about people here who have worked alongside us, even at the risk of their own safety, for years in some cases, and have also fought alongside us and made their personal contribution,"" Kramp-Karrenbauer was quoted as saying by DPA.

""I feel it is a deep obligation of the Federal Republic of Germany not to leave these people behind without protection now that we are finally leaving the country.""

Kramp-Karrenbauer added that helping local personnel was also an obligation of all international forces in Afghanistan to ensure the safety of the Afghan staff.

Taliban poses a threat

Since Washington and NATO announced the troop withdrawal decision, rights groups have raised concerns over Afghanistan's destiny.

They fear that the Islamist Taliban would seize more power in the country. While Western powers are aware of the potential chaos that looms over post-withdrawal Afghanistan, they have pledged to support the people.

The Taliban has already been vocal with threats over the withdrawal announcement.

They want foreign troops to pull out by May 1 as per agreement with former US President Donald Trump.

Thomas Silberhorn, a member of the Bundestag and Parliamentary State Secretary at Germany's Ministry of Defense, recently told DW that NATO has done a ""brilliant job"" on preparing Afghan forces to secure the country by themselves.

Germany is set to pull out its NATO's Resolute Support mission by mid-August and the US by September 11.

There are currently around 10,000 NATO troops in Afghanistan, including nearly 1,100 Germans.

India is the world's second most-infected nation with almost 14.8 million cases.

Hospitals usually reserved for employees of ministries or public sector companies should convert some of their wards into Covid-19 facilities equipped with ICU and oxygen-supported beds, ventilators, laboratories and healthcare staff, the government said.

In West Bengal state, where an election is being held over several phases with rival parties holding huge rallies -- sparking further super-spreader fears -- Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee appealed for more oxygen and coronavirus medicines such as remdesivir.

Banerjee added that her state needed more vaccines to tackle the outbreak. India has administered more than 122 million jabs so far, but some states have complained of low stocks and experts have said that the rollout needs to be sped up.

Both Banerjee and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party held large election campaigns on Sunday.

Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the Congress party, a small player in the West Bengal polls, tweeted Sunday that he was suspending all his rallies in the state ""in view of the covid situation"".",439,2753,11,70
1,Parliamentarian Cuts Minimum Wage From Stimulus Due To Obscure Rule Requiring Poor Citizens To Needlessly Suffer,https://politics.theonion.com/parliamentarian-cuts-minimum-wage-from-stimulus-due-to-1846367027,"

WASHINGTON—Citing the long-standing practice of maintaining boundaries between the classes, Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough asked Democrats to cut a minimum wage increase from their stimulus package Friday due to an obscure rule requiring poor citizens to needlessly suffer. “Raising the minimum wage would violate an 1834 statue put in place to inflict arbitrary pain on the nation’s most vulnerable groups,” said MacDonough, explaining that the rule was used as precedent to stop the 95th Congress from increasing the minimum wage to $2.50 in 1977. “There’s only one interpretation of this rule as it clearly states that providing relief for impoverished Americans is not to be included in any budgetary legislation. These policies exist for a reason. Punishing the lower class is a non-partisan issue. There’s no need to be frustrated with either party—take up your gripes with the Andrew Jackson administration and the 23rd United States Congress.” At press time, the stimulus package was in limbo while the Senate Parliamentarian determined if it was within the country’s purview to help the unemployed.",172,1122,16,112

Managers from Nasa and Elon Musk’s space company on Friday (NZT) cleared the Falcon rocket and Dragon capsule for a dawn liftoff with a crew of four to the International Space Station.

They will spend six months at the orbiting lab, replacing another SpaceX crew that’s close to coming home.

The rocket and capsule were designed for reuse. The rocket was used to launch the current station crew last November from Nasa's Kennedy Space Centre.

Two days after our staff expected him, a severely overweight, dead-eyed Shigeru Miyamoto just showed up to the Onion Gamer Expo with his eyebrows shaved off, and he is now silently wandering around the convention hall.

Oof. We really don’t know what to make of this.

See, Mr. Miyamoto, the legendary game designer for Nintendo, was originally scheduled to give a presentation on the main stage earlier this week. As abiding fans of everything he’s contributed to the history of video games, we were all really excited by a rumor that he might be making a big announcement about an upcoming Mario game. He didn’t show up, though, and we didn’t hear anything from him or his representatives about where he was. Ultimately, we assumed he had canceled due to an illness.

Flash forward to today, spectators at the Cyberpunk 2077 demonstration noticed an unhealthily obese, middle-aged Japanese man standing completely still in the middle of the Marvel’s Avengers tent, emptily staring at an exit sign. We didn’t recognize him at first, but after taking a second look, we realized, dear God, that’s Shigeru Miyamoto, and he looks like he’s in horrible shape.

What the hell is going on, gamers?

Our first concern wasn’t that he had missed delivering Monday’s exclusive OGE Nintendo Direct. The more pressing thing was that Miyamoto appeared to be eating from a three-pound sack full of pistachios while repeatedly muttering the word “liars” under his breath in a near-catatonic state. His shirt is completely stained and rumpled, and, well, let’s just say he doesn’t smell great. It’s like a combination of rubbing alcohol and really badly burnt clay—it makes you gag a little just getting a whiff from far away.

After overcoming our distress, we tried to approach the designer behind The Legend Of Zelda and Super Mario and ask what he thought of the conference, and he just said, “Maybe I will—maybe I fucking will—see how they feel about it” before wandering off to the Epic Games booth, where he’s now just glaring at Tim Sweeney and breathing loudly. We’re really scared, and we’re not sure why.

Readers, should we call an ambulance or something?

Either way, we’ll keep an eye on him for you, and let you know if there are any updates. Suffice it to say, it doesn’t look like we’re getting bonus DLC for Super Mario Odyssey or a new 3DS version of Mario Party anytime soon, and what this means for the future of Nintendo in the next generation is anyone’s guess.",432,2532,27,167
0,Russia’s Sputnik vaccine injects divisions into EU,https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-sputnik-coronavirus-vaccine-divisions-eu/,"Russia's Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine is dividing Europe — sometimes even before a single dose has been delivered.

The Russian jab hasn't yet been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) — where it's currently under rolling review — and the European Commission says the bloc won't need it. It's also not clear whether it will arrive in time to make a difference in some countries. But that hasn't stopped a number of governments breaking away from the EU's common approach to cut their own deals.

Sputnik claimed its biggest prize to date last week, when Germany, thus far a champion of the EU's common approach, said it would begin talks to secure supplies of the vaccine. The German move follows in the footsteps of Hungary and Slovakia, which have both ordered doses. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, meanwhile, said he concluded talks this past weekend to buy 1 million doses.

Other European governments, by contrast, have steered clear. Russia's critics say Moscow is deliberately using the vaccine to sow division. They give short shrift to the insistence of Sputnik's backers that the vaccine has nothing to do with geopolitics. Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Šimonytė described Sputnik V in a tweet as a ""hybrid weapon to divide and rule.""

The jab is also causing divisions even within European governments. Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is keen to use the Russian vaccine — and is apparently committed enough that his government sacked its health and foreign ministers in recent days due to their opposition to Sputnik.

The European outreach for the vaccine comes even as EU politicians sound the alarm over Moscow's actions in other domains — such as a build-up of troops on the Ukrainian border — and its treatment of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, whose health is reportedly deteriorating rapidly in prison.

Information security experts, meanwhile, warn that Moscow is leveraging Sputnik to advance Russia's broader aims in tandem with a sophisticated media campaign.

Some European politicians say the decision by Germany in particular to hold talks on buying Sputnik risks inflicting major damage to European unity. German Green MEP Viola von Cramon-Taubadel, who has criticized the vaccine in the past, described Germany's move as a “geopolitical disaster” that the Kremlin is leveraging to amplify divisions throughout the bloc.

“It's really disturbing that German politicians are obviously naive enough not to understand what's going on,” said von Cramon-Taubadel, who sits on the European Parliament's foreign affairs committee. She described negotiations with a major European power like Germany as a propaganda coup for Russian President Vladimir Putin that would be broadcast ""all over the Russian public and state TV broadcasts.""

Irreconcilable differences

The Sputnik team has fought back, repeatedly denying that their motivation is anything other than stopping the pandemic. In a January interview with POLITICO, Kirill Dmitriev — the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund , the sovereign wealth fund that promotes the shot abroad — complained about politicization of the vaccine.

""Russians created a good vaccine, and they want to protect their own people and play some part in the rest of the world’s [response],"" Dmitriev said at the time. ""That this creates so much political commotion shows the sad state of political affairs.""

In response to a request for comment for this article, a spokesman for RDIF drew attention to a tweet from the Sputnik account that read: “Politicization of vaccines is unethical and costing lives.” RDIF said that “the media should strive to help the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, not to hamper this fight with false allegations.”

Sputnik’s global rollout gained more momentum on Monday after India’s drug regulator authorized the use of the shot in the country. RDIF said that it aimed to produce over 850 million doses of the vaccine a year in India after having closed tie-ups with a number of major local manufacturers.

Meanwhile, controversy over the jab has already claimed political casualties in Europe, as seen in the turmoil in the Czech Republic. Even more spectacularly, the Slovakian government collapsed in March over the decision of then-Prime Minister Igor Matovič to unilaterally buy 2 million doses of Sputnik V.

The crisis continued even after Matovič stepped down and took the position of finance minister. The national drug regulator refused to validate the batches of the Russian vaccine sent to the country on grounds that the doses were different from the vaccine validated in a Phase 3 study published in the Lancet medical journal.

The refusal enraged Matovič, who last Thursday flew to Moscow to discuss the situation with RDIF. In an extraordinary move, he then announced that Slovakia would side-step its own national drug regulator and instead rely on a Hungarian laboratory to perform the required checks.

Clashes over Sputnik aren't limited to Central and Eastern Europe, however, as politicians across the Continent are under severe pressure to tackle a sluggish and widely criticized vaccination effort. The latest blow to that effort came on Tuesday, when Johnson & Johnson said it would “proactively delay” the rollout of its coronavirus vaccine in Europe, citing blood clotting concerns in the U.S.



The Russian vaccine has also provided the pretext for a spate of attempts by regional governments to forge their own side deals, breaking away from national plans.

In Spain, the region of Madrid, led by conservative president Isabel Díaz Ayuso, attempted to obtain Sputnik doses in what amounted to a challenge to the Socialist-led national government. And in Germany, Bavaria actually moved ahead of Berlin, announcing an order earlier on the same day. State Premier Markus Söder told journalists that Bavaria would sign a provisional agreement to buy 2.5 million doses.

Meanwhile, in France, Renaud Muselier, president of the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region, tweeted on Wednesday that it will receive half a million doses of Sputnik. In Italy, the president of the Campania region, Vincenzo De Luca, has entered into a collision course with the national government over his decision to sign a deal for a reported half a million doses. In all of these cases, though, EMA approval is cited as necessary.

German pressure

In Germany's case, it's not clear whether Sputnik doses will arrive in time to make a difference, especially since Health Minister Jens Spahn has insisted that any purchase will require the EMA's all-clear. Given that two other vaccines, Novavax and CureVac, started their rolling review before Sputnik, and that the EMA still has to conduct a check of the vaccine's Russian facilities, it’s possible that the shot will only be approved once most or nearly all Europeans have already been vaccinated.

This is the line taken by EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton, who has said that the bloc had “absolutely no need” for Sputnik. He reiterated those remarks last Friday, stating that ""Sputnik V is simply too late for our goal of vaccinating as many Europeans as possible in the summer.""

This possibility has been acknowledged by Spahn, who recently said on German radio that to make a difference, the delivery would have to arrive in the next two to five months, “otherwise, we have more than enough vaccine anyway.”

But German politicians are under particularly heavy pressure to find ways — however much of a long shot they may be — to boost the vaccine rollout in an election year. Germany has continued to struggle with stubbornly high infection numbers, forcing the government into embarrassing and unpopular lockdown decisions.

Katrin Boettger, a director at the Berlin-based Institute for European Politics think tank, said the move is one way to garner some positive attention amid endless cycles of bad news for the health ministry — although it's not the only motivation.

""It's the case that the public is very critical about the low level of vaccinations that have taken place in Germany at the moment,"" Boettger noted. But she also pointed to a practical reason for trying to secure Sputnik jabs: More than one vaccine-maker has had to revise their deliveries, sometimes dramatically, downwards since the EU began its vaccination campaign. Despite the European Commission's best assurances, many countries may well miss their late-summer coverage target.

""I think that they're just trying to cover their bases a little bit,"" Boettger said.

German MEP Peter Liese, health spokesperson of the center-right European People's Party, said he had been skeptical of the vaccine, but now believes the EMA will approve Sputnik.

""If we have a vaccine that's approved by the EMA, and we say a European agency says it's safe, how can we then say we just don't want it for political reasons?"" Liese remarked to journalists last week. It also makes sense for the EU to have options, he added, since there's no certainty that other vaccine-makers will deliver on their commitments, given recent history.

Romanian MEP Cristian-Silviu Buşoi, also of the EPP and co-chair of the contact group on vaccines for the European Parliament, takes a different stance. He pointed to media reports concerning the safety of the vaccine as a potential red flag. There have been reports of four deaths and six serious health complications — but Russian authorities have dismissed those reports, saying the vaccine has not caused a single death.

RDIF has also sought to distance itself from the safety issues that have been linked to the other adenoviral vaccines from Johnson & Johnson and Oxford/AstraZeneca, saying that there have been no cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis associated with the shot.

Buşoi also underlined the potential strategic hazard of using the vaccine: ""This is obviously used by Russia as a political tool. Otherwise it would have been used to increase the vaccination rate in Russia, which is still low, rather than exporting it abroad.""

One senior EU diplomat, noting the disarray in Slovakia over the question of the vaccine's data, suggested Berlin's embrace of Sputnik made little sense and wished Germany the ""best of luck.""

""But in politics, in many cases, common sense is not a common practice,"" he added.",1659,10330,7,50
0,Toxic puffer fish mass washouts in Cape Town,https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/sci-tech/2021-03-25-toxic-puffer-fish-mass-washouts-in-cape-town/,"Tetrodotoxin is about 25 times more powerful than cyanide and if ingested in large enough doses will cause paralysis before death.

The American Center for Disease Control says that death from ingesting tetrodotoxin can occur as early as 20 minutes or as late as 24 hours.

City officials are not sure what exactly caused the mass puffer fish deaths as there were no adverse water conditions, red tide, or pollution leading up to the deaths.

True to their name, however, puffer fish tend to inflate themselves when threatened and the city says that a massive fish fight as a result of mass courtship may have led to many male fish inflating and being washed ashore by the wind.

“The department of environment forestry and fisheries (DEFF) has reported and confirmed that there were no adverse (pollution) water conditions or red-tide toxins that may have caused this large scale mortality,” said Nieuwoudt.

“The DEFF has indicated that here are, however, some interesting causes of past puffer fish mortalities recorded in SA and elsewhere. These include mass courtship; spawning and fighting which sees the male puffer fish inflate themselves, and then sometimes get rolled or blown out of the water by waves and/or wind. The City can therefore not confirm the exact cause of the mortalities,” she said.

The city said it would continue to monitor the affected areas.

“We want to assure residents that the cleanup operations will be ongoing. The puffer fish is not for human or animal consumption, so we advise that all beachgoers and dog walkers avoid areas that may still need to be cleaned,” said the statement.

“Due to the reporting of a few puffer fish spotted at Fish Hoek beach, the coastal management team is now sweeping the area and will continue to monitor this beach as well,” said Nieuwoudt.

According to the city, oceanographic and meteorological conditions contributing to the development of algal blooms or so-called ‘red tides’, low-oxygen conditions, large temperature differences (icy to warm water), washouts and mortalities of fish and invertebrates on the West Coast, False Bay and the rest of SA are monitored and tracked by the National Oceans and Coastal Information Management System (OCIMS), a partnership between DFFE, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and the SA Environment Observation Network (SAEON).

Similar large-scale fish deaths have been reported recently along the Eastern Cape coast near Gqeberha where a sudden change in temperature resulted in fish being stunned, causing them to wash ashore.

REUTERS/Yara Nardi/File Photo

Matteo Salvini, leader of Italy's right-wing League party, must stand trial on charges of kidnapping over his decision to prevent more than 100 migrants from landing in the country in 2019, a judge ordered on Saturday.

Salvini, who was interior minister at that time, left the migrants stranded at sea until prosecutors ordered the seizure of the ship and the evacuation of the people on board.

The trial will begin in the Sicilian capital of Palermo on September 15.

Salvini, who has built much of his political fortune on an anti-immigration campaign, could face up to 15 years in prison if found guilty at the end of a tortuous, three-stage judicial process.

A definitive conviction could bar him from government office.

""I am going to trial with my head held high, in your name as well as mine. Italy first, always,"" Salvini tweeted immediately after the ruling. ""Defending our country is a citizen's sacred duty ... that is what I am being tried for.""

During his 14 months as interior minister, Salvini stopped several boats from docking in Italy in an effort to halt migrant flows, and regularly accused the charities that operated them of effectively encouraging people smuggling.

Proactiva Open Arms, the Spanish NGO which operated the migrant rescue ship at the heart of the case, welcomed the judge's ruling.

""Violating a fundamental right such as the protection of human beings at sea for the sake of political propaganda is shameful,"" said its founder Oscar Camps, adding that the trial would be ""an opportunity to judge a period of European history.""

Salvini withdrew the League from the coalition government in the summer of 2019 in a failed bid to trigger an election when his party was riding high in the polls.

The League, now part of Mario Draghi's two-month-old national unity government, has lost more than 10 points of voter support but remains the most popular party in Italy on about 23%, according to most opinion polls.

""It is time to end America's longest war,” Biden said during a speech at the White House on April 14. ""It is time for American troops to come home.”



Biden said the drawdown of the 2,500 remaining U.S. troops in Afghanistan will start on May 1.



""We’ll not conduct a hasty rush to the exit,"" he said. ""We'll do it responsibly, deliberately, and safely, and we will do it in full coordination with our allies and partners.""



""Our presence in Afghanistan should be focused on the reason we went in the first place: to ensure Afghanistan would not be used as a base from which to attack our homeland again,"" Biden said, declaring: ""We accomplished that objective.""



The president warned the Taliban that he would ""hold them accountable for its commitment not to allow any terrorists to threaten the U.S. or its allies from Afghan soil.""



He also urged regional powers, including Pakistan, India, China, Russia, and Turkey, to play supportive roles in Afghanistan.



Biden pledged continued support for the Afghan government, but not militarily.

""While we will not stay involved in Afghanistan militarily, our diplomatic and humanitarian work will continue,"" he said. ""We will continue to support the government of Afghanistan.""

Biden also promised to continue providing assistance to the 300,000-strong Afghan Army and police force.



The White House said in a separate statement that Biden spoke with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on April 14 and the two expressed continued commitment to a strong bilateral partnership after the departure of U.S. combat troops from Afghanistan.



""Biden emphasized that the United States will continue to support the Afghan people, including through continued development, humanitarian, and security assistance,"" it said.

Ghani wrote on Twitter that he had spoken on the telephone with Biden and he respected the U.S. decision.



Ghani said that ""we will work with our U.S. partners to ensure a smooth transition"" and ""we will continue to work with our US/NATO partners in the ongoing peace efforts.""



Ghani insisted after the phone call with Biden that his forces were ""fully capable"" of controlling the country.

""We plan to have the withdrawal of all U.S. and Resolute Support Mission forces completed within a few months.""



Earlier on April 14, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with officials at NATO headquarters in Brussels.

“We will work very closely together in the weeks and months ahead on a safe, deliberate and coordinated withdrawal of our forces,” Blinken said in a televised statement at NATO headquarters in Brussels ahead of a video conference with the military alliance's foreign and defense ministers.

There are also some 7,000 non-U.S. troops from mainly NATO countries -- as well as Australia, New Zealand, and Georgia -- in Afghanistan, outnumbering the 2,500 American soldiers, but still relying on U.S. air support, planning, and leadership for their training mission.

""Together, we have achieved the goals that we set out to achieve and now it is time to bring our forces home,"" said Blinken, who was accompanied in the Belgian capital by U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.

Blinken also spoke by phone with Pakistan's army chief on April 14 and discussed the peace process, according to a statement from the media wing of Pakistan's military.

Biden's announcement means a delay by about five months of a U.S. pledge to withdraw by May 1, a deadline agreed with the Taliban under former President Donald Trump.

The militant group on April 14 reiterated its call for the withdrawal of all foreign forces by the date stipulated in the U.S.-Taliban agreement signed in February 2020.



A senior U.S. official who briefed reporters on April 13 about Biden’s decision on the U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan said the withdrawal would begin before May 1 and could be completed well before the September 11 deadline.

The withdrawal will not be subject to further conditions, including security or human rights, the official said.



""The president has judged that a conditions-based approach, which has been the approach of the past two decades, is a recipe for staying in Afghanistan forever,"" according to the official. The United States will instead focus its efforts on supporting the ongoing peace process, the official added.



But the White House said on April 14 that it was not in the Talban’s interest to allow Afghanistan to become a ""pariah state"" or allow Al-Qaeda to take hold, in reference to the Taliban’s brutal rule in the 1990s.



Meanwhile, Russia said Washington's plan to pull out troops from Afghanistan by September could lead to an escalation in the decades-old conflict.

""What is concerning in this context is that the armed conflict in Afghanistan might escalate in the near future, which in turn might undermine efforts to start direct intra-Afghan negotiations,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said in an April 14 statement.

It remains unclear how the move would impact a planned summit scheduled to begin April 24 in Istanbul seeking to revive intra-Afghan peace talks in Doha, Qatar.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid warned: “If the agreement [with the United States] is breached and foreign forces fail to exit the country on the specified date, problems will certainly be compounded and those who failed to comply with the agreement will be held responsible.”

Another Taliban spokesman, Muhammad Naeem, said on April 13 the group would not take part in any summits that would make decisions about Afghanistan until all international troops “completely withdraw from our homeland.”



Meanwhile, CIA Director William Burns warned on April 14 that Washington's ability to collect and act on threats will diminish when the time comes for the U.S. military to withdraw from Afghanistan.

""There is a significant risk once the U.S. military and the coalition militaries withdraw,"" Burns told the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, although he said the United States would retain ""a suite of capabilities.""

The agreement between the Trump administration and the Taliban called for the Taliban to halt attacks and hold peace talks with the Afghan government in exchange for a U.S. commitment to a complete withdrawal by May 2021.



Biden said last month that the withdrawal deadline would be difficult to meet due to logistical challenges, while the Taliban warned of “consequences” if it reneged on the May 1 deadline.

U.S. commanders have said that the Taliban has failed to meet the conditions of the peace agreement by continuing attacks on Afghan security forces and civilians and failing to totally cut ties with Al-Qaeda and other extremist groups.



Biden’s decision comes after a review of the February 2020 agreement and amid a growing consensus in Washington that little more can be achieved in the country.



The United States has tried before to withdraw from Afghanistan, but concerns about Afghan security forces, corruption, and the resiliency of the Taliban have hampered the plans.



A U.S. withdrawal by September 11 would coincide with the 20th anniversary of the terrorist attacks in the United States that killed nearly 3,000 people. After the attacks, the United States led an invasion of Afghanistan that toppled the Taliban regime for harboring Al-Qaeda, the terrorist group behind the 9/11 attacks.

0,France top court confirms Sarah Halimi drugged murderer 'irresponsible',https://m.jpost.com/diaspora/antisemitism/frances-court-confirms-sarah-halimi-murderer-irresponsible-for-taking-drugs-665173,"The Court began its deliberations on March 4 on whether or not to overrule the lower court’s decision not to try Kobili Traoré for killing Halimi in 2017 after that decision was appealed in 2019.

France's lower court decided in December 2019 to excuse the antisemitic murderer of a Jewish woman from a criminal trial because heavy intake of cannabis supposedly compromised his “discernment,” or consciousness.

In April 2017, Traoré, a 27-year-old Muslim man, beat Halimi, his 65-year-old Jewish neighbor, while screaming ""Allah Akbar"" (God is great) and antisemitic slogans before throwing her out of the window of her third-floor apartment to her death. At the time of the ruling, the judge cited psychiatric evaluations saying Traoré’s consumption of marijuana before the incident led to a “delirious episode” that made him not legally responsible for his actions. However, the judge also said that Traoré, who is in his 30s, killed Halimi because he is an antisemite. The lower court's decision sparked outrage among the French and international Jewish community.

The Wednesday verdict triggered a fresh round of outrage from Jewish organizations, upset that such a precedent would be set.



The French Chief Rabbi reacted on Twitter, saying that such a decision was a scandal, adding that ""antisemitism was not a madness"" but a crime that should be legally punished. cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); }); if(window.location.pathname.indexOf(""656089"") != -1){console.log(""hedva connatix"");document.getElementsByClassName(""divConnatix"")[0].style.display =""none"";}

April 14, 2021

The CRIF umbrella group of French Jewish communities called it a “miscarriage of justice,” while the founder of the National Bureau for Vigilance Against Antisemitism, a communal watchdog known as BNVCA, said he “no longer had full confidence that antisemitic hate crimes in France are handled properly.”

THE SIMON Wiesenthal Center also commented, saying it was profoundly distressed by the French Supreme Court's final say, concerning the legality of the Paris Appeals Court decision, denying the criminal responsibility of Halimi's murderer. ""After a harrowing three years of courtroom debate on the criminal responsibility of a murderer, presumably 'under the influence' of cannabis - which basically resulted in him being interned in a psychiatric hospital instead of being judged and condemned to prison - the family has been on edge until now,"" said Dr. Shimon Samuels, the center's director for international relations. ""This is a devastating blow!""

""Moreover, since the consumption of cannabis is intended to obtain a modification of the state of consciousness, Kobili Traoré must have been aware of the risks involved in this consumption,"" they said. ""Therefore, the consumption of narcotics is an aggravating circumstance and may not at the same time constitute grounds for exemption from criminal liability."" Samuels stressed that ""the Supreme Court’s decision now closes the case definitively... and instead of allowing it to be re-examined by the Appeals Court on the basis of a more solid legal standpoint, it confirms that it is possible to deny justice for a murder aggravated by its antisemitic character. Furthermore, this decision denies closure for the family and potentially creates a precedent for all hate criminals to simply claim insanity – or decide to smoke, snort or inject drugs or even get drunk before committing their crimes."" According to Dalloz, France’s prominent professional and university legal publisher, the main arguments of Halimi's lawyers were that ""drug addiction is not a mental illness and does not fall within the scope of psychic or neuropsychic disorders covered by article 122-1 of the penal code. The voluntary act of drug consumption constitutes wrongful behavior which excludes irresponsibility.""Moreover, since the consumption of cannabis is intended to obtain a modification of the state of consciousness, Kobili Traoré must have been aware of the risks involved in this consumption,"" they said. ""Therefore, the consumption of narcotics is an aggravating circumstance and may not at the same time constitute grounds for exemption from criminal liability.""

According to Algemeiner, following confirmation of Traoré's criminal irresponsibility, he would be held in mental health institutions until doctors deem him fit to be released back into society – and the only penalty he would receive would be a ban from visiting the site of the killing and having contact with Halimi’s family for 20 years.

“How can we have a ‘discernment’ that is abolished, but the remainder of a conscience?” Muriel Ouaknine Melki, a lawyer representing the Halimi family, told Algemeiner prior to the trial. They added that Traoré's trial was important to all French citizens, as it would set a precedent that “the consumption of narcotics can be a cause for exonerating from penal responsibility in criminal matters.”

0,‘Dangerous’ beast in tree turns out to be croissant,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/croissant-tree-poland-animal-b1831943.html,"Animal rescuers in Poland called to a report of a dangerous-looking creature lurking in a tree approached it with trepidation – only to discover the mystery beast was a croissant.

A woman in Krakow had called to say the animal had been in the tree for two days and that residents were afraid to open their windows because they worried it would go into their homes, according to the city’s animal-welfare society.

The organisation, which revealed the case on Facebook, said staff asked her whether it could be a bird of prey but she described as resembling an iguana.

Officers feared the animal was an unwanted pet and could have died of cold or hunger.

One inspector, identified only as Adam, said they were used to pets being abandoned, writing: “We had an old Yorkie thrown into the yard in the evening, a seriously ill cat left in a closed transporter in a dumpster carport in winter, rats and hamsters with a cage thrown in the rubbish, even fish in a street bucket.”

He described how they approached the creature. “Suddenly... Here he is, got him! The brown creature is sitting on a lilac branch … the creature sits and doesn’t move – exactly as the notifier described us.

“His brown skin shines in the sun ... We are looking more closely – poor guy has no legs or head.”

Discovering the object to be a croissant, they guessed it was probably thrown out of a window by a neighbour to feed birds.

“It’s hard to help something that was previously baked, not in the sunlight,” Adam wrote.

The organisation said the public should continue to err on the side of caution and report any concerns about animal welfare.",289,1624,9,51

Při mohutné explozi 50 tun munice v říjnu 2014 zahynuli dva čeští občané Vratislav Havránek a Luděk Petřík - a následně bylo evakuováno několik obcí. Na tiskové konferenci to v sobotu řekli premiér Andrej Babiš a ministr vnitra Jan Hamáček s tím, že Česko v reakci na ohlášená zjištění vyhostí 18 ruských diplomatů. Čepiga s Miškinem byli o pět let později odhaleni jako ruští agenti, kteří se neúspěšně pokusili o atentát na dvojitého špiona Sergeje Skripala v britském Salisbury s pomocí bojově paralytické látky novičok.

V rámci GRU Čepiga s Miškinem působí ve specializované jednotce s číslem 29155, která provádí násilné akce v zahraničí. Policie, konkrétně Národní centrála proti organizovanému zločinu, na případu pracovala řadu let společně s kontrarozvědkou BIS a brněnským krajským státním zastupitelstvím.

Stejné pasy

Policie ověřila, že oba muži přiletěli do Česka 11. října 2014 pravidelnou linkou Aeroflotu z Moskvy. Území země opustili 16. října, kdy odjeli do Rakouska a odtud odletěli zpět do Moskvy. Při vstupu do Česka se oba prokázali krycími pasy vystavenými rozvědkou GRU, které později použili během akce ve Velké Británii. Cestovní dokumenty byly vydány na fiktivní jména Ruslan Boširov a Alexandr Petrov.

Veřejně deklarovaným cílem jejich cesty byla návštěva muničního skladu ve Vrběticích, kam se dopředu objednali. Každý, kdo chce zařízení z obchodních důvodů navštívit, musí jeho správcům předem poslat e-mail se žádostí, v jakém časovém rozmezí chtějí přijít; v případě cizinců musí dodat i kopie pasů. Čepiga s Miškinem se do Vrbětic objednali e-mailem, který byl podle policejní expertizy zbaven všech metadat. To znemožňuje určit, odkud přesně byl odeslán.

Oba muži za sebou zjevně zametali stopy po celou dobu pobytu v Česku, respektive chtěli být co nejméně dohledatelní. Pasy, které poslali do Vrbětic, nebyly ty samé, s nimiž pak překročili státní hranice. Opět šlo o krycí dokumenty, tentokrát vydané na jméno Ruslan Tabarov (v případě Čepigy) a Nikolaj Popa (v případě Miškina).

Po krátkém pobytu v Praze Čepiga s Miškinem odjeli na severní Moravu, kde se ubytovali v menším ostravském hotelu. Povolení ke vstupu do Vrbětic jim provozovatel vydal na období od 13. do 17. října. K výbuchu v muničním skladu č. 16 došlo 16. října v 9:25. Policie zatím nemá přímý důkaz, že do areálu oba muži fyzicky skutečně vstoupili, ale považuje tuto hypotézou za vysoce reálnou.

Vyvozuje to z jejich příletu do Česka v daném období, přesunu na Moravu, kde se sklad nachází, ze zaslané žádosti o návštěvu i z použití krycích pasů, s nimiž byli posléze ve Británii v bojové akci. Další indicií jsou některé dnes už prozrazené násilné akce, kterých se oba účastnili - nejznámější je zmiňovaný případ ze Salisbury.

https://twitter.com/PolicieCZ/status/1383478030505365514

Právě v době, kdy se měli Čepiga s Miškinem ve Vrběticích nacházet, se tu podle policie vyskladňovaly zbraně, které měl nakoupit jeden z významných bulharských obchodníků se zbraněmi. Zřejmě dodával zbraně na Ukrajinu, která byla právě ve válce s Ruskem. Obchodník je měl prodávat ukrajinským silám, což by se pochopitelně nelíbilo Moskvě. Kdyby tak byly zbraně znehodnoceny s pomocí výbušného zařízení umístěného do zásilky, poškodilo by to obchodníka v očích jeho partnerů.

Policie pracuje s verzí, že právě kvůli tomu Čepiga s Miškinem přijeli. „Výbušný systém se dosud nepodařil najít, protože vrbětický areál byl zcela zničený. K výbuchu zřejmě nemělo dojít v Česku, ale až později při transportu zbraní v jiné zemi,“ tvrdí zdroj dobře obeznámený s vyšetřováním.

Pokud je tato hypotéza pravdivá, pak mohl sklad vybouchnout předčasně. Není vyloučeno, že zmínění zahynuvší zaměstnanci Havránek a Petřík mohli s materiálem manipulovat a tím explozi způsobit. Vrbětický areál si dlouhodobě pronajímá od státního podniku Vojenský technický ústav společnost Imex Group.

Důležitý terč

Jak se posléze ukázalo, důležitým terčem pro GRU byl bulharský obchodník se zbraněmi Emilian Gebrev. V roce 2015 – což později potvrdilo vyšetřování mezinárodní investigativní skupiny Bellingcat a také bulharské policie - se členové ruské rozvědky měli podílet na dvou pokusech o otravu tohoto byznysmena. Poprvé k tomu došlo v hlavním městě Sofii, podruhé o měsíc později v jeho letním domě u Černého moře.

V květnu 2015 se Gebrevovi náhle udělalo špatně a začal zvracet na večeři v luxusní restauraci v centru hlavního bulharského města. Měl oči podlité krví, den nato upadl do kómatu. Lékaři zjistili, že někdo obchodníka s jeho dvěma společníky otrávil. Vyšetřovatelé neúspěšně ukončili pátrání po pachatelích útoku o rok později. Případ však obnovili v roce 2018, když došlo k otravě Sergeje Skripala.

Bulharská prokuratura tehdy získala nové informace a obvinila z pokusu o vraždu Gebreva dva ruské občany spojené s GRU. Motiv atentátu zůstal nevyřešen, nejčastěji se spekulovalo o tom, že Gebrevovo impérium dodávalo zbraně ukrajinskému ministerstvu vnitra a Národní gardě, jejíž členové bojovali ve válce na Donbasu proti proruským separatistům.

Zahraniční aktivity ruské vojenské rozvědky GRU se podařilo poprvé odhalit poté, co se ruští hackeři prolomili do počítačů Demokratické strany před americkými prezidentskými volbami v roce 2016 a snažili se ovlivnit kampaň v neprospěch Hillary Clinton. Jak později zjistil deník The New York Times, sídlo jednotky 29155 specializované na zahraniční akce je ve výcvikovém středisku GRU na východě Moskvy a její členové prošli řadou krvavých konfliktů v Afghánistánu, Čečensku i na Ukrajině.

Bellingcat a Respekt: Útočník na Skripala je zraněný hrdina z Dagestánu

I v samotné GRU podléhala práce jednotky vysokému stupni utajení. „Skupina známá jako jednotka 29155 funguje nejméně deset let, západní představitelé ji však objevili teprve nedávno. Úředníci zpravodajských služeb ve čtyřech západních zemích říkají, že není jasné, jak často je mobilizována, a varují, že nejde dopředu určit, kdy a kde její agenti zaútočí,“ napsal v minulosti list The New York Times.

O členech jednotky 29155 jsou stále známy jen útržkovité informace. Vede ji generálmajor Andrej V. Averjanov, který v roce 1988 absolvoval vojenskou akademii v Taškentu v tehdejší Uzbecké sovětské socialistické republice. Je pravděpodobné, že se účastnil první i druhé rusko-čečenské války, v roce 2015 byl vyznamenán jako Hrdina Ruské federace. Právě jeho fotografii otiskl list NY Times: Averjanov je na ní zachycen v roce 2017 na svatbě své dcery a pózuje se zmíněným členem jednotky Anatolijem Čepigou, který se podílel na otravě Sergeje Skripala.

Respekt již v minulosti zjistil, že v roce 2014, kdy vybuchl vrbětický muniční areál, navštívil Česko Alexandr Miškin s dalším příslušníkem jednotky Denisem Vjačeslavovičem Sergejevem. Ten zde vystupoval pod krycím jménem Sergej Fedotov; i on se později účastnil akce proti Skripalovi, jeho skutečné jméno odhalila v roce 2019 společná investigace Bellingcatu s Respektem. Bylo to již na konci ledna, tedy devět měsíců před příjezdem Čepigy a Miškina na severní Moravu. Miškin se Sergejevem se tenkrát ubytovali v pražském hotelu Best Western Meteor Plaza v Hybernské ulici. Jestli už tehdy byli v Česku kvůli Vrběticím a připravovali budoucí operaci, není dodnes jasné.",1170,7719,16,98
0,US-funded broadcaster asks European court to block Russian fines,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/16/us-funded-broadcaster-asks-european-court-to-block-russian-fines,"Moscow has moved to penalise Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty for failing to label its reports with the ‘foreign agent’ tag.

The Moscow bureau of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) has called on Europe’s top human rights court to order Russian authorities against enforcing fines that could cost the broadcaster millions of dollars.

The multimedia news outlet, which is funded by Washington, has been heavily fined this year for what Russia says is a repeated failure to label itself as a media outlet “performing the functions of a foreign agent”.

RFE/RL says Russian authorities have the power to place it into insolvency or block access to its media sites if the fines are unpaid – or do both.

Andrey Shary, its general director, faces the prospect of a prison sentence of up to two years and personal bankruptcy, the network fears.

“We are hopeful that the European Court of Human Rights will view these actions by the government of Russia for what they are: an attempt to suppress free speech and the human rights of the Russian people,” RFE/RL President Jamie Fly said in a statement.

Fly added that Moscow’s actions set a “dangerous precedent at a time when independent media are under assault around the globe”.

The standoff has added to friction in Washington’s ties with Moscow that are already at post-Cold War lows, under pressure from several issues including Ukraine, Syria, sanctions and the jailing of Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny.

However, any favourable ruling by the ECHR would likely be largely symbolic as Russia passed a law last year giving its national legislation precedence over international treaties and rulings in cases when they conflict with its constitution.

‘Irreversible harm’

Since October, Russia’s communications watchdog Roskomnadzor has filed 390 violation cases against RFE/RL and is expected to announce more on Friday.

The watchdog has the power to label foreign-funded NGOs, media or individuals it deems are engaged in political activity as “foreign agents”.

Roskomnadzor has ordered RFE/RL to place a precautionary statement on its material which reads: “This report (material) was created and (or) disseminated by a foreign mass medium performing the functions of a foreign agent and (or) a Russian legal entity performing the functions of a foreign agent.”

The designation also requires publications to report their funding and spending.

The broadcaster says the watchdog’s fines for failing to carry the statement could total the equivalent of $2.4m and cause “irreversible harm”.

RFE/RL, which is funded by a grant from US Congress through the United States Agency for Global Media, argues it has full editorial independence protected by US law and that the labelling requirement amounts to defacing its own product.

“While RFE/RL has complied with all of its legal obligations under the foreign agents law, it has declined to implement this new labelling requirement, which is clearly intended to damage its reputation and viability as an independent media organisation in Russia,” the broadcaster said in a statement.

The outlet, which has a network of freelancers across Russia, covers Crimea, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014, in great detail, and provides extensive coverage – in Russian – of opposition protests and the fate of Navalny. It says it has almost doubled its Russian audience over the last five years.

The outlet, which was founded in the 1950s and was initially funded via the CIA, was for years at odds with Soviet authorities during the Cold War.

After the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s predecessor in the Kremlin, Boris Yeltsin, invited RFE/RL to open an office in Russia.

Moscow clamps down on dissent

Roskomnadzor said in a statement on Friday that compliance with the “foreign agent” law was mandatory and that the label was designed to make clear to a Russian audience that such organisations “pursue the interests of other states”.

But the law, which applies to non-governmental political organisations and media receiving foreign funding, has been widely criticised as aiming to discredit critical reporting.

Russia has recently stepped up actions that appear to be aimed at stifling dissent.

Criminal charges were filed this week against four editors of an online student magazine. The publication had posted a video connected to January’s nationwide protests calling for Navalny’s release.

A court last week fined Twitter 8.9 million rubles (about $117,000) for failing to remove posts in which users called for minors to rally in the pro-Navalny demonstrations.",732,4620,9,64

We can drop the ball on that, no problem,” said Peter Gaynor, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, adding that with everything the Trump administration had been dealing with lately, a routine failure along the lines of its bungled responses to Hurricanes Maria and Dorian should make for a nice change of pace. “Seriously, all we have to do is not provide anywhere near enough temporary shelters, maybe spread some misinformation about where the storm is actually headed, and then see to it that a completely unproven startup with a clear, unethical connection to the administration misdirects any crucial supplies urgently needed in flood zones. Should be a fairly straightforward case of lethal government malpractice.” Following news that Isaias had forced the closure of numerous Covid-19 testing sites in Florida, a White House spokesperson confirmed things were already off to a pretty good fuck-up.

REUTERS/Jason Reed

Australia’s federal government and the state of South Australia have signed a A$1.1 billion ($851 million) deal to finance measures aimed at making energy more affordable and helping to curb carbon emissions.

Australia said in December it could beat its target for cutting carbon emissions under the Paris climate agreement by 2030 without counting credits from overachieving on its targets in previous climate pacts, marking a shift in policy for one of the world's biggest emitters per capita.

Under the agreement, South Australia will provide A$422 million and the federal government will spend A$660 million, A$400 million of which will be spent on ""priority areas"" such as carbon storage, electric vehicles, hydrogen and other projects aiming at reducing emissions.

""Families and businesses need affordable, reliable power. That is what reduces prices and creates jobs,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison said during a televised briefing while announcing the agreement.

""Australians also want to ensure we are doing everything we responsibly can to combat climate change.""

Premier of South Australia Steven Marshall said the deal will also help to deliver the infrastructure needed for electric cars and to generate new revenue for farmers from carbon reductions.

""This agreement is going to lower power bills for South Australians and create jobs in the fast-growing renewables industry,"" Marshall said.

But the agreement was criticised Mark Butler, who worked as minister for climate change under a previous Labor government.

""What we get is, bit by bit, little bits of announcements in particular states instead of a comprehensive national policy that will underpin investor certainty to transition Australia's energy future,"" said Butler, currently the shadow minister of health.

The paper losses totaled $64.8 billion, including the fictional profits he had credited to customer accounts over at least two decades.

More than money was lost. At least two people, in despair over their losses, died by suicide. A major Madoff investor suffered a fatal heart attack after months of contentious litigation over his role in the scheme. Some investors lost their homes. Others lost the trust and friendship of relatives and friends they had inadvertently steered into harm’s way.

Mr. Madoff was not spared in these tragic aftershocks. His older son, Mark, died by suicide in his Manhattan apartment early on the morning of Dec. 11, 2010, the second anniversary of his father’s arrest. He was characterized by his lawyer, Martin Flumenbaum, as “an innocent victim of his father’s monstrous crime who succumbed to two years of unrelenting pressure from false accusations and innuendo.” One of Mark Madoff’s last messages before his death was to Mr. Flumenbaum: “Nobody wants to believe the truth. Please take care of my family.”

In June 2012, Bernard Madoff’s brother, Peter, a lawyer by training, pleaded guilty to federal tax and securities fraud charges related to his role as the chief compliance officer at his older brother’s firm, but he was not accused of knowingly participating in the Ponzi scheme.

In December 2012, Peter Madoff forfeited all his personal property to the government to compensate his brother’s victims; he was sentenced to a 10-year prison term. And on Sept. 3, 2014, Mr. Madoff’s younger son, Andrew, died of cancer at the age of 48. He had blamed the stress of the scandal for the return of the cancer he had fought off in 2003.

Besides the human toll, professional reputations were destroyed. More than a dozen prominent hedge funds and money managers, including J. Ezra Merkin and the Fairfield Greenwich Group, had to admit that they had forwarded their clients’ money to Mr. Madoff without detecting that he was running a fraud. Swiss private bankers, global commercial banks and major accounting firms were dragged into court by clients who had relied on them to monitor their Madoff investments.",385,2340,13,75

They are only deployed when an officer feels like they are in imminent danger. Sure, in some cases, poorly aimed tires have caused internal bleeding, fractured bones, or left bruises shaped like tread marks over various body parts, but overall, this bouncy, flexible alternative is far preferable to being run over with hard metal wheels. Believe me, if these were intended to cause serious harm, you would know it.” Monahan later refused to address claims by manufacturers that rubber tires are only less lethal when aimed at the ground rather than directly at protestors.

0,"US Police shoot 13 year old with his hands ups. Immediately before the release, prosecutors retrated statements that he had a gun.",https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-04-15/chicago-to-release-video-of-cop-fatally-shooting-13-year-old,"Body-camera video released Thursday after public outcry over the Chicago police shooting of a 13-year-old boy shows the youth appearing to drop a handgun and begin raising his hands less than a second before an officer fires his gun and kills him.

A still frame taken from Officer Eric Stillman’s jumpy nighttime body-camera footage shows that Adam Toledo wasn’t holding anything and had his hands up when Stillman shot him in the chest around 3 a.m. March 29. Police, who were responding to reports of shots fired in the area, say the teen had a handgun on him before the shooting. In Stillman’s footage, the officer shines a light on a handgun on the ground near Adam after shooting him.

The release of the footage and other investigation materials comes at a sensitive time, with the ongoing trial in Minneapolis of former Officer Derek Chauvin in the death of George Floyd and the recent police killing of another Black man, Daunte Wright, in a nearby suburb.

Before the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, an independent board that investigates all shootings by police in Chicago, posted the materials on its website, Mayor Lori Lightfoot called on the public to keep the peace, and some downtown businesses boarded up their windows in anticipation of unrest.

Small groups of protesters gathered at a police station and marched downtown Thursday night, but there were few signs of widespread demonstrations in the city.

“We live in a city that is traumatized by a long history of police violence and misconduct,” Lightfoot said. “So while we don’t have enough information to be the judge and jury of this particular situation, it is certainly understandable why so many of our residents are feeling that all-too-familiar surge of outrage and pain. It is even clearer that trust between our community and law enforcement is far from healed and remains badly broken.”

Nineteen seconds elapsed from when Stillman exited his squad car to when he shot Adam. His body-camera footage shows him chasing the boy on foot down an alley for several seconds and yelling, “Police! Stop! Stop right f— now!”

As Adam slows down, Stillman yells, “Hands! Hands! Show me your f— hands!”

Adam then turns toward the camera, Stillman yells, “Drop it!” and midway between repeating that command, he opens fire and Adam falls down. While approaching the wounded teen, Stillman radios for an ambulance. He can be heard imploring the boy to “stay awake,” and as other officers arrive, Stillman says he can’t feel a heartbeat and begins administering CPR.

In a lengthy email, Stillman’s attorney Tim Grace said Adam left the officer no choice but to shoot.

“The juvenile offender had the gun in his right hand … looked at the officer which could be interpreted as attempting to acquire a target and began to turn to face the officer attempting to swing the gun in his direction,” Grace wrote. “At this point the officer was faced with a life threatening and deadly force situation. All prior attempts to deescalate and gain compliance with all of the officer’s lawful orders had failed.”

Adeena Weiss-Ortiz, an attorney for Adam’s family, told reporters after the footage and other videos were released that they “speak for themselves.”

Weiss-Ortiz said it’s irrelevant whether Adam was holding a gun before he turned toward the officer.

“If he had a gun, he tossed it. The officer said, ‘Show me your hands.’ He complied. He turned around,” she said.

The Chicago Police Department typically doesn’t release the names of officers involved in such shootings this early in an investigation, but Stillman’s name, age and race — he’s 34 and white — were listed in the investigation reports that the Civilian Office of Police Accountability released Thursday.

Weiss-Ortiz said she looked into Stillman’s history and found that “he had no prior discipline, no prior events.”

Lightfoot, who along with the police superintendent called on the independent board to release the video, urged the public to remain peaceful and reserve judgment until the board completes its investigation. Choking up at times, she decried the city’s long history of police violence and misconduct, especially in Black and Latino communities, and said too many young people are left vulnerable to “systemic failures that we simply must fix.”

She also described watching the video as “excruciating.”

“As a mom, this is not something you want children to see,” she said.

In addition to posting Stillman’s video, the review board released footage from other body-worn cameras, four third-party videos, two audio recordings of 911 calls and six audio recordings from ShotSpotter, the system that alerted police to gunshots in that area of Little Village, a predominantly Latino and Black neighborhood on the city’s West Side.

Adam, who was Latino, and a 21-year-old man ran when confronted by police, and Stillman shot the boy once in the chest after a chase during what the department described as an armed confrontation. The 21-year-old man was arrested and booked on a misdemeanor charge of resisting arrest.

The review board initially said it couldn’t release the video because it involved the shooting of a minor, but it changed course after the mayor and police superintendent called for the video’s release.

Lucky Camargo, an activist and lifelong resident of Little Village, decided not to watch the video. But neighbors described it to her as “an execution.”

“This was wrong,” she said. “I didn’t need to watch the video to make that assessment on my own. I don’t feel there was any justification to shoot someone.”

Footage of the shooting had been widely anticipated in the city, where the release of some previous police shooting videos sparked major protests, including the 2015 release of footage of a white officer shooting Black teenager Laquan McDonald 16 times, killing him.

Before the Stillman video’s release, some businesses in downtown Chicago’s Magnificent Mile shopping district boarded up their windows. Lightfoot said that the city had been preparing for months for a verdict in the Chauvin trial and that it had activated a “neighborhood protection plan” ahead of Thursday’s release.

“It happens now that these circumstances are sitting next to each other,” she said.

Adam’s mother described him as a curious and goofy seventh-grader who loved animals, riding his bike and junk food. The Toledo family issued a statement urging people to avoid violent protests.

“We pray that for the sake of our city, people remain peaceful to honor Adam’s memory and work constructively to promote reform,” the family said.

Before the video’s release, Lightfoot and attorneys for the family and city said in a joint statement that they agreed that in addition to the release of the video, all investigation materials should be made public, including a moment-by-moment compilation of what happened that morning.

“We acknowledge that the release of this video is the first step in the process toward the healing of the family, the community and our city,” the joint statement reads. “We understand that the release of this video will be incredibly painful and elicit an emotional response to all who view it, and we ask that people express themselves peacefully.”

The Chicago Police Department has a long history of brutality and racism that has fomented mistrust among the city’s many Black and Latino residents. Adding to that mistrust is the city’s history of suppressing damning police videos.

The city fought for months to keep the public from seeing the video of a white officer shooting Laquan 16 times in 2014, killing him. The officer was eventually convicted of murder. And the city tried to stop a TV news station from broadcasting video of a botched 2019 police raid in which an innocent, unclothed Black woman wasn’t allowed to dress herself until after she was handcuffed.",1323,8138,22,130
0,Suga-arrives-in-Washington-for-talks-with-Biden-China-topping-agenda,https://japantoday.com/category/politics/Suga-arrives-in-Washington-for-talks-with-Biden-China-topping-agenda,"By MARI YAMAGUCHI and AAMER MADHANI

Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga arrived in Washington on Thursday for talks with U.S. President Joe Biden meant to show the strength of the two nations' security alliance at a time when both are concerned with China’s growing economic and military clout.

Friday's talks will be Biden's first face-to-face meeting with a foreign leader since he took office, and they follow four years of uncertainty for the Japan-U.S. alliance under former President Donald Trump’s administration.

Japan's Foreign Ministry said Suga hopes to reaffirm the alliance's “strong bond” and discuss a multinational effort to defend democratic values and counter China’s growing global influence and disputed territorial claims.

“I hope to develop a relationship of trust with President Biden and further strengthen the Japan-U.S. alliance bound by the universal values of freedom, democracy, human rights and rule of law,” Suga told reporters Thursday before heading to Tokyo's Haneda International Airport.

Suga said he and Biden will ""compare and adjust our policies, and we will demonstrate to the rest of the world the leadership of Japan and the United States toward achieving a free and open Indo-Pacific region.”

Japanese officials said Biden and Suga are expected to discuss how to manage the peace and stability of regional seas, including the Taiwan Strait, where tensions are rising. The two leaders are also expected to discuss the human rights situation in Hong Kong and China's northwestern Xinjiang region.

Japan has taken a milder approach to allegations of Chinese human rights violations and has not joined the United States and European nations in imposing sanctions. Gen Nakatani, a ruling party lawmaker and former defense minister, is leading a nonpartisan parliamentary group calling for Suga's government to take tougher steps, including sanctions, to be in line with Western democracies, but a decision has not been made.

Japan considers China’s growing military activity in the region as well as its broad territorial claims to be a security threat. Japan is itself locked in dispute with China over Beijing’s claim to the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands, called Diaoyu in China, in the East China Sea.

Elsewhere Tokyo has watched with concern as China has built military installations on disputed territory it claims in the South China Sea.

The U.S., meanwhile, has butted heads with China over numerous issues, including the coronavirus pandemic, human rights, Chinese policy in Hong Kong, Xinjaing and Tibet and trade. To erode China’s claims on the South China Sea, U.S. ships regularly conduct so-called “freedom of navigation” operations, sailing into international waters that China is trying to claim as its own.

China denies it is expansionist and says it is only defending its territorial rights. It says that the largest threat to regional peace and stability is the U.S.

Also on the cards for the talks between Biden and Suga are the ongoing fight against the pandemic, COVID-19 vaccine cooperation to support developing countries, establishing less China-reliant supply chains and climate change, Japanese officials said.

Suga, who has set a goal of achieving a carbon neutral society by 2050, said he hoped to closely cooperate with Biden to jointly lead international efforts to tackle the issue when the U.S. leader hosts a virtual climate change summit just a week after their meeting.

According to a proposed class action filed in B.C. Supreme Court last week, the North American operations for DHL's express courier delivery service have been requiring customers to pay extra fees to receive their parcels by making claims that are ""false, misleading and deceptive.""

Court documents claim that DHL leads customers to believe that fees they must pay once a parcel arrives from out of the country are government import and tax fees — when a large portion of them are actually going to DHL as a ""processing fee.""

""I don't think anybody has any difficulty paying for taxes and duty that's properly owing and payable,"" said the Vancouver lawyer behind the class action, Scott Stanley.

""It's when there's additional fees that aren't clear where people get their backs up.""

The lead plaintiff in the case is Gayle Vallance — a retired school teacher from Fernie, B.C. Court documents say Vallance ordered two books on fabric weaving from the U.K. in February — paying DHL $98 for shipping.

Nine days later, she was advised by DHL that her shipment had arrived in Canada, but she had to pay $33.16 in ""duties and taxes"" before it would be delivered.

""At all material times prior to payment, DHL represented to the Plaintiff that the fee being charged on her shipment was for duties and taxes,"" say court documents.

The claim says Vallance only learned ""after numerous inquiries to DHL"" that $17 of that fee went to the courier company as a processing fee.

Hidden fees?

At issue in the proposed class action is how transparent the company is about the fees it charges customers.

Court documents say that DHL usually sends an email to customers with the subject line ""IMPORT DUTY/TAX PAYMENT,"" advising them to pay up or risk losing their parcel.

The case says people paid the fees, believing them to be for duties and taxes. ""In reality,"" says the claim, the fees charged ""included a DHL processing or brokerage fee.""

""This was a hidden fee.""

Stanley says customers are ""already paying DHL to deliver these packages — they're not doing this for free. And this seems to be an extra charge that we say isn't clearly described for the consumer.""

The proposed lawsuit says DHL conducted an ""unlawful scheme"" that breaches a section of the federal Competition Act and ""constituted an unfair business practice contrary to consumer protection legislation"" across Canada.

""DHL was unjustly enriched by its conduct,"" says the civil claim.

Lead plaintiff Gayle Vallance alleges the 'duty and taxes' she was charged for a delivery was mostly a fee that went to DHL. (Submitted by Lindsay Vallance)

Go Public recently reported the story of a Calgary woman who — like Vallance — was surprised to learn that a chunk of the ""duty and taxes"" she believed she owed the government for importing a soccer jersey for her son was actually going to DHL as a processing fee.

After her story was published, Go Public heard from dozens of other customers who felt they, too, were misled by notifications from DHL that suggested all the additional fees — on top of the shipping already paid — were government charges.

According to the company's website, DHL is the biggest international courier company in the world, headquartered in Germany. With more than 380,000 employees, it serves more than 220 countries and territories and delivers almost 1.6 billion parcels a year.

DHL has yet to file a statement of defence, and the class action has not been certified — which determines whether it moves forward.

When contacted for a response, DHL spokesperson Daniel McGrath said the company does not comment ""on active legal matters."" When contacted about our previous Go Public story about alleged hidden fees, DHL spokesperson Hazel Valencia said information about the company's processing fee ""is available on the DHL website.""

Who is included in proposed class action?

Although filed in B.C., the proposed class action represents all residents of Canada who have paid DHL fees.

It seeks compensation for people who ""sustained loss and damage"" by paying DHL's processing or brokerage fees.

It also seeks payment for the ""stress and anxiety"" caused by spending time investigating the fees charged by DHL, communicating with DHL and reporting the company's ""unlawful conduct"" to the Better Business Bureau and other consumer protection organizations.

The proposed class action is similar to one filed on behalf of Ontario residents against United Parcel Service in 2007. It, too, centred on brokerage fees that were charged to customers — allegedly without their knowledge. The case was settled in 2018.",800,4820,12,77

But he has not quelled the threat that Mr Navalny poses to his rule. An open letter sent to The Economist today from nearly 80 eminent writers, actors, artists, historians and public intellectuals from around the world highlights the ignominy Mr Putin is bringing upon himself and his regime.

The signatories report that Mr Navalny, who last August survived poisoning with Novichok, a nerve agent, that many blame on Mr Putin, has symptoms of a severe neurological disorder—constant back pain and the loss of sensation in his legs and hands, as well as a severe cough and fever. “As a Russian citizen, he has the lawful right to be examined and treated by a doctor of his choice,” note the signatories of the letter. “Having been denied this right, on March 30th, he began a hunger strike in protest.” His wife says that, in his cell in Pokrov, some 100km (60 miles) east of Moscow, he has lost some 16kg in weight.

He is now being threatened with forcefeeding that would amount to torture. Mr Navalny’s doctors have demanded immediate access to him, saying his health is now approaching a critical state.

Instead of a doctor, the Kremlin has sent a television propaganda team, led by Maria Butina, a celebrity Putin supporter who was jailed in America for infiltrating American political circles as part of Russia’s attempt to influence the presidential election of 2016. Swaggering into Mr Navalny’s barrack with a TV crew, she yelled that the prison was more comfortable than a hotel in the small Siberian town where she grew up. (No matter that it has no hotel at all.) When Mr Navalny’s doctor and political ally, Anastasia Vasilyeva, arrived at the prison gates to demand access a few days later, she was detained, along with several journalists, including one from CNN.

Few things illustrate the pettiness of Mr Putin’s regime as clearly as its treatment of political prisoners. Mr Navalny asked for a family photo album; it was denied. While he is on hunger strike, he says, the prison governor had sweets planted in his clothes and gave his cellmates an electric stove on which they grill chicken and bread. “This is the essence of this regime’s [belief]: why would anyone want to defend his principles or fight for his rights if there is tasty grilled chicken nearby,” Mr Navalny said in an Instagram post via his lawyers.

While the Kremlin tries to crush Mr Navalny’s morale, his team has mounted a campaign to free him. It has called for a 500,000 strong street protest demanding Mr Navalny’s release and has already persuaded nearly 450,000 to sign up for it. And it continues to needle Mr Putin with revelations of alleged corruption in his regime, including, most recently a new revelation about one of Mr Putin’s lavish residences with massage rooms, a swimming pool, and an extreme-cold cryotherapy chamber.

Faced with the possibility of the largest protest in modern Russia’s history and the prospect of suffering a crushing defeat in the parliamentary elections in September, the Kremlin has responded with drastic threats. On April 16th Russian prosecutors demanded that Mr Navalny’s anti-corruption foundation and all his regional branches should be banned as extremist organisations. This would mean that anyone working or even volunteering for Mr Navalny could face criminal charges.

A statement, issued by Mr Navalny’s team, says this amounts to mass political repression. “The darkest times for any freethinking people and for the civil society in Russia are coming. Effectively the Kremlin has just demanded that anyone who disagrees with it, who disagrees with [Mr Putin’s] palaces...with corruption...is recognised as an extremist.” The Kremlin’s move has solidified Mr Navalny’s reputation as Mr Putin’s number-one opponent.

Even in his torment, Mr Navalny can subject Mr Putin, too, to an agonising dilemma. On the one hand, giving in to the hunger striker’s demand would look like a political defeat, and a moral victory for his hated critic. But to let him die would make Mr Putin even more like “the killer” President Joe Biden has called him. Facing new American sanctions imposed this week for a range of Russian behaviour, Mr Putin must know that Mr Navalny’s death would make any hope of international rehabilitation even more remote.",740,4458,24,139

0,US set to brand Taiwan as currency manipulator even as ties warm,https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Markets/Currencies/US-set-to-brand-Taiwan-as-currency-manipulator-even-as-ties-warm,"NEW YORK -- Growing U.S. support for Taiwan as part of a geopolitical battle with China is not deterring Washington from branding the island as currency manipulator.

Taiwan's addition to the U.S. Treasury Department's list of manipulators in its semi-annual foreign exchange report, expected to be published on Thursday, ""appears to be consensus now,"" according to Francesco Pesole, a forex strategist with Dutch financial services firm ING Group.

In a note Wednesday, ING estimated the Taiwanese central bank's foreign exchange interventions in 2020 amounted to 5.8% of gross domestic product -- way above the 2% threshold set by the U.S. Treasury.

""We thought the Treasury already gave a free pass -- by underestimating [forex] interventions -- to Taiwan in December, possibly due to geopolitical considerations related to China's influence in the region,"" Pesole wrote, referring to the last report released by former President Donald Trump's administration.

The Taiwan dollar gained 5.6% against the greenback in 2020. But the island's currency fell sharply this week on expectations that it will be branded a manipulator -- falling more than 2% from a peak in early March.

China, despite the trade, tech and geopolitical tensions with the U.S., is set to be spared.

""China is not manipulating its currency so I expect that to be reflected in the report,"" said David Dollar, a former Treasury official who is now a senior fellow in the John L. Thornton China Center at the Washington think tank Brookings Institution.

The Treasury's new foreign exchange report will be the first under Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's leadership. At her confirmation hearing in January, Yellen vowed that she would work to fulfill President Joe Biden's promise to ""oppose any and all attempts by foreign countries to artificially manipulate currency values to gain an unfair advantage in trade.""

Even so, the Biden administration is likely to downplay tensions over exchange-rate policies with trading partners in Asia, due in part to geopolitical considerations, even though some are on the U.S. Treasury's currency manipulator list, Fitch Ratings said in a Wednesday note.

To China's chagrin, the U.S. has rapidly been drawing closer to Taiwan. Just last Friday, the State Department issued new guidelines that will enable American officials to meet more freely with their Taiwanese counterparts, ""to encourage U.S. government engagement with Taiwan that reflects our deepening unofficial relationship.""

A U.S. delegation, including former Deputy Secretaries of State Richard Armitage and James Steinberg, is currently visiting Taipei.

Last year, Taiwan's central bank started actively buying U.S. dollars following a steep appreciation of the Taiwan dollar.

In December, the Trump administration placed both Taiwan and China on its monitoring list for meeting two out of three criteria for the currency manipulator label -- a goods trade surplus with the U.S. of over $20 billion and an account surplus of more than 2% of GDP over a 12-month period.

The December report pegged Taiwan's intervention at 1.7% of GDP, 0.3 percentage point short of the 2% threshold.

As the new edition of the report looms, Taiwan's central bank has acknowledged the risk of being tagged. Gov. Yang Chin-long told parliament in March that it is ""possible"" that the U.S. will make such a designation. The last time Taiwan was named in 1992.

But Yang reassured Taiwanese lawmakers that even if Washington went forward with such a move, it would have no immediate impact on Taiwan's economy.

Speaking to parliament, Yang also maintained that Washington's large trade deficit with Taipei should be attributed to demand -- the island is a big producer of semiconductors -- rather than not exchange rates.

""We think the impact on Taiwan's economic growth would be limited because we don't expect the U.S. to impose import tariffs on goods from Taiwan,"" Oxford Economics write in a note on Thursday. ""That would weigh on bilateral relations at a time of rising cross-strait tensions with China and harm U.S. firms that rely on Taiwan's semiconductors.""

Taiwan's recent exchange-rate policies have drawn criticism from members of the Biden administration, including Brad Setser, counselor to the U.S. Trade Representative.

In 2019, Setser, then a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, published a research report alleging that Taiwan hid over $100 billion in reserves and related currency intervention from the U.S. Treasury.

""The case for the U.S. naming Taiwan a currency manipulator under the 1988 act is actually stronger than the case for naming China,"" Setser wrote in a tweet associated with the report.

Last September, Setser again maintained that there is ""an increasingly strong case"" for giving Taiwan such a designation, in reaction to a Reuters report that the island is limiting outright currency intervention by blocking forex transactions.

JPMorgan's Asia rates and forex strategy team wrote in a March note that they expect Taiwan's central bank to adopt a more hands-off approach to its currency, as it faces ""increasing pressures on both external and domestic fronts.""

Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and India were also on the Treasury's monitoring list last year, while Vietnam was tagged a currency manipulator. ING expects Vietnam's designation to continue while flagging Thailand as at risk of joining its ranks.

But ""labeling a country a manipulator is often a less effective lever than the threat of doing so,"" Mark Sobel, a former senior Treasury official and U.S. chairman of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, wrote in a March article.

The U.S. currency manipulator label does not trigger immediate penalties such as tariffs. It requires bilateral engagement on currency policies that can involve the International Monetary Fund. Such a designation, which remained fairly rare up until a few years ago, could also cause swings in foreign exchange markets.

In 2016, Congress enacted legislation to make currency manipulator determinations by a quantitative approach consisting of three metrics, in place of a more qualitative weighing. The Trump administration further adjusted the current account metric to 2% of GDP from 3%, making it easier for economies to cross the threshold.",992,6349,12,64

0,More than 200 travellers fined for refusing to quarantine in hotels after landing in Canada,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/quarantine-hotel-covid-19-travel-canada-fine-1.5988378,"Len Desharnais says he believes Canada's hotel quarantine requirement for international travellers during the pandemic is a fair idea.

But shortly after arriving in Vancouver from Bangkok on March 18, he said he decided not to check into his quarantine hotel, because he felt proper COVID-19 safety precautions weren't in place based on his shuttle ride to the hotel and what he observed upon arrival.

""It's just a joke. It's not safe, as far as I'm concerned,"" said Desharnais.

He's one of hundreds of international travellers who have taken issue with Canada's hotel quarantine requirement, designed to help slow the spread of COVID-19.

As of March 30, 219 tickets have been issued to air passengers entering Canada who refused to quarantine at a designated hotel, said the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). The fine for violating the requirement is $3,000, said PHAC.

CBC News interviewed two travellers, including Desharnais, who say they defied the rules for safety reasons and have yet to receive a fine.

Traveller Len Desharnais says he decided not to check in to his quarantine hotel in Vancouver because he felt proper COVID-19 safety protocols were not being followed. (Submitted by Len Desharnais)

On Feb. 22, the federal government mandated that air passengers entering Canada must take a COVID-19 test upon arrival and spend up to three days quarantining at a government-approved hotel to wait for their test results. Passengers must foot the bill for their stay, which can cost up to $2,000.

Travellers who test negative can go home to finish their 14-day quarantine. Those who test positive will be transferred to a different designated government facility.

Desharnais, an Albertan who relocated to Thailand 10 years ago, was returning to Canada to do contract work as a safety adviser in the oil industry in Fort McMurray, Alta.

He said he grew concerned about checking in to his quarantine hotel after taking the hotel shuttle bus from the airport.

""It was right at that point where I got worried, saying that this was not a safe situation.""

Desharnais said the shuttle's driver handled travellers' luggage without wearing gloves or first disinfecting the bags; the shuttle was packed, so he wasn't physically distanced from other passengers; and there was no plexiglass between the passengers and the driver.

""He's been around so many passengers all day.… I got concerned.""

Desharnais said that after arriving at the quarantine hotel, an employee also took no precautions when handling passengers' luggage.

Current evidence suggests the main way COVID-19 spreads is through close contact with an infected person, but that it can still happen by touching a contaminated surface.

Desharnais said he made the decision to leave at this point and do his entire 14-day quarantine at a friend's home in Prince George, B.C.

""If you feel a job is unsafe, not only do you have the right, but you must refuse it. So I take that into my personal life also.""

'It's not about safety'

Fanny Lapointe said she, too, decided to skip the hotel quarantine requirement for safety reasons, and has yet to receive a fine for doing so.

""What is more secure, to go directly to your place and see no people, or go to the hotel and see many people?"" said Lapointe, who lives just outside Montreal.

She said she flew to Las Vegas to attend a friend's wedding, and when she returned to Montreal on March 11, she went directly home.

Lapointe said she concluded she'd be safer quarantining at home after a friend who stayed in a quarantine hotel earlier that month told Lapointe that she was allowed to leave her room during her stay.

""She was able to do whatever she wants,"" said Lapointe, who also objects to the high price of the hotel stay.

""It's just to punish people who travel. It's not about safety.""

Several other travellers who stayed in quarantine hotels have also complained to CBC News about what they consider lax COVID-19 safety measures, including crowded waiting areas and quarantining guests freely leaving their hotel rooms.

""There was no security whatsoever, nothing to prevent us from leaving the room,"" said snowbird Bob Ardern of Lunenburg, N.S. He stayed in a quarantine hotel in Toronto in early April, after returning from a winter stay in Curaçao, a Caribbean island.

Public Health Agency responds

Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) spokesperson Tammy Jarbeau told CBC News the agency monitors the hotels by calling quarantining guests and periodically visiting the hotels to make sure they're adhering to the agency's health and safety requirements.

Jarbeau said hotel guests can also lodge complaints with PHAC.

""Hotels that do not adhere to the requirements set out by PHAC will no longer be used"" as a quarantine hotel, Jarbeau said in an email.

At this point, the government has approved 59 quarantine hotels, which are located near the international airports in Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto and Montreal, the only cities where international flights are currently allowed to land in Canada.

Watch: Some international travellers complain about their hotel quarantine stay:

Quarantine hotels problems include access to food, travellers say The National 2:07 Some Canadians who’ve had to stay at a mandatory quarantine hotel say they’ve been met with long delays, crowded waiting areas and issues accessing basic needs like food. 2:07

Jarbeau also said quarantining travellers are responsible for ensuring they stay in their hotel room. According to a government website, guests can leave their rooms for scheduled outdoor time, but must be escorted out by security.

In January, before the hotel quarantine rule took effect, 0.5 per cent of Canada's COVID-19 cases were associated with international travel , according to PHAC. That figure dropped to 0.4 per cent in both February and March.

The agency said these statistics are an ""underestimation"" of the actual numbers.

Hotel quarantine court battle

Both Lapointe and Desharnais said if they do receive a fine from PHAC for refusing to quarantine in a hotel, they will fight it.

""I already know lawyers and, like, I'm ready to contest it,"" said Lapointe.

The government's quarantine requirement is already facing a legal fight from the Canadian Constitution Foundation (CCF), a constitutional rights advocacy organization.

Last month, CCF launched a lawsuit in Ontario Superior Court alleging the requirement violates Canadians' constitutional rights, including the right to enter Canada and the right to liberty.

On March 22, a judge dismissed CCF's bid for an injunction that would suspend the hotel quarantine requirement while the case is before the courts.

In his decision, Justice Frederick L. Myers wrote that refusing the injunction was in the public interest by trying to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

However, Myers also said the constitutionality of the hotel quarantine requirement has yet to be determined in court.

PHAC said it couldn't comment on a case that's before the courts.",1202,7423,15,91

Broadcasting into Wednesday’s International Energy Agency-United Nations conference on reaching net-zero emissions, Indian energy minister Raj Kumar Singh rebuked developed countries for using up 80% of the world’s carbon budget. That, he said, leaves little room for billions across Africa, Asia and Latin America to follow the same path to prosperity.

Singh argued the answer is for richer countries to start outlining plans to clean up carbon dioxide, which accumulates and remains in the atmosphere for centuries.

“I believe that it’s important for all the developed countries to talk about, not net zero, but about removing more carbon from the atmosphere than they are adding — net negative is what they need to talk about,” Singh said. “And they need to tell us what they will do by 2030.”

The roughly 10-minute speech ― made to peers such as U.S. climate czar John Kerry, European Union climate minister Frans Timmermans, and Chinese energy chief Zhang Jianhua ― marked something of a turning point in climate politics. Developing countries whose emissions will determine the climate future have long pressed the U.S. and Europe, whose wealth traces back to colonizing swaths of Africa, Asia and the Americas, for more money and aid to slash emissions. But to date no high-ranking officials have demanded those rich countries clean up the carbon they spewed unchecked for over a century.

“A statement this direct about the need for negative emissions and addressing who might be responsible for it has not been made in a forum like this before by such a senior person,” said Michael Thompson, an expert in carbon removal policy at Carnegie Climate Governance Initiative who previously worked in New Delhi. “India’s comments in this setting may bring other countries, particularly developing countries, to the table.”

The Ever-Shrinking Carbon Budget

Global climate negotiations have largely centered on how to stop increasing the output of greenhouse gas pollution. With the exception of 2020, when pandemic-induced lockdowns halted factories and kept cars off the road, emissions have grown steadily over the past few decades and are set to rise again this year as economies reopen and countries scramble to make up for lost profits. Half of all emissions added to the atmosphere since industrialization kicked off in 1751 came after 1990, when governments understood the effects of global warming.

Hindustan Times via Getty Images Indian energy minister Raj Kumar Singh speaks in Patna, India.

The planet is already 1.1 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial averages. The 2015 Paris climate accord marked the first global agreement to slash emissions and to try to keep that temperature rise from exceeding 1.5 degrees, beyond which the effects on coastal cities, food systems and nature are forecast to be catastrophic.

In recent years, some countries have begun to make progress. The U.S., the world’s No. 2 source of emissions and historically the top emitter, elected President Joe Biden, who has started outlining plans to eliminate emissions from the power sector by 2035 and electrify the country’s 276 million automobiles. China, today’s top emitter, vowed to reach carbon neutrality by 2060, and over the past month intensified its domestic political mandates to peak emissions this decade. The European Union has made significant strides to green its post-pandemic spending, while the United Kingdom, fresh from exiting the bloc, is ramping up renewable energy and climate research.

“We should be wary about climate politics becoming too future-focused,” Aarti Gupta, a professor of global environmental governance at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, said in an email. “It’s too easy for the historically largest emitters to say: let’s not look back; let’s collectively look to the (far) future.”

Removing carbon dioxide is absolutely necessary. Even the most optimistic scenarios, where countries pursue aggressive renewable, electrification and energy efficiency goals, reduce air travel, and replace 80% of meat and eggs with cultivated alternatives, require at least 400 gigatons of carbon dioxide be removed from the atmosphere, according to a 2018 study in the journal Environmental Research Letters. The rate and volume of carbon removal needed to keep warming in check varies by model and is the subject of some debate among researchers. But most suggest the world should remove roughly 6 gigatons of CO2 per year by midcentury.

Technology Vs. Trees

There is fiery debate among advocates and researchers over how best to remove carbon from the atmosphere.

Trees are one popular method. Woody flora suck in prodigious amounts of carbon as part of photosynthesis, making forests what are generally known as “carbon sinks.” This, for example, is why preserving the Amazon rainforest or the northern boreal forest intact is widely considered such a vital and practical goal for staving off climate disaster. One 2019 study in the journal Science found planting new trees across an area the size of the United States could slash the CO2 in the atmosphere by a whopping 25%.

But that raises some big issues in practice. Between 2000 and 2014, foreign governments and corporations took control of some 500 million acres in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean as part of deals to conserve land to offset carbon emissions, and in doing so forced native peoples off their lands in what was dubbed “cultural genocide.” In 2014, the Journal of Rural Studies called the practice “carbon colonialism.”

The speed and direction of deployment of these technologies can’t be up to private industries, can’t be up to Chevron, and can’t be up to Exxon. We need public management and non-market control. Georgetown University political philosopher Olúfẹ́mi Táíwò

Government programs to pay private landowners to plant trees can provide perverse incentives to cash in by destroying existing forests, then planting new trees over them. Mexico’s scheme to pay farmers $213 per month to reforest over 1 million hectares of degraded land and grow more than 1 billion trees by the end of this year caused, by one estimate, the loss of nearly 73,000 hectares of forest coverage in 2019, according to a Bloomberg Green report.

Then there’s the issue of increased wildfires and the spread of tree-killing diseases and parasites, which could wipe out decades of carbon removal in one swoop.

Other forms of carbon removal, such as soil-management practices that are gaining traction with farmers, remain uncertain, despite holding other benefits for resiliency against extreme weather and the nutritional value of the food grown using them.

That has fueled growing calls for technological solutions to pull carbon from the air. The leading technology so far is called direct air capture, essentially giant vacuum fans that suck carbon from the air and magnetically attach it to calcium or potassium molecules, transforming the emissions into a substance that can be injected underground for permanent storage, to prevent its return to the atmosphere.

It’s a controversial gambit. The machines require huge amounts of electricity and could, if relied on to meet climate goals at scale, sap a full quarter of the world’s energy supply by the end of this century, according to a 2019 paper in the journal Nature Communications. Spending $1 trillion per year on the technology could help deploy it at scale and work out the kinks to make it cheaper and less energy intensive, a Nature study published in January found. But the Biden administration set aside just a fraction of that amount for all its climate efforts over the next eight years as part of its $2 trillion infrastructure package unveiled this week, meaning such a bid would be an extremely difficult political sell.

Carbon Engineering A rendering from the Canadian firm Carbon Engineering shows what one of its future direct air capture plants may look like.

The White House’s proposal included a call for Congress to amend the so-called 45Q tax credit that currently funds carbon capture projects to encourage more direct air capture investments. At the moment, that federal tax credit primarily benefits retrofits that catch CO2 at power plants and industrial factories and turn the gas into a substance that can either be stored or, as is more often the case, injected into nearly exhausted oil wells to obtain the dregs of crude. The price fetched selling that oil offsets the cost of capturing the CO2.

That, at present, does nothing to reverse the damage from climate change, but few other financial incentives exist for direct air capture. The two companies that currently produce the machines ― Carbon Engineering, based in Canada, and Climeworks, headquartered in Switzerland ― work with major polluters. Carbon Engineering took money from oil giant Occidental Petroleum. Climeworks struck a deal to supply the Coca-Cola Co., the world’s biggest source of plastic pollution, with CO2 for beverage carbonation.

“If we want to actually deploy carbon removal in a justice-oriented way, it can’t continue to be governed by the fossil fuel industry,” said Andrew Bergman, a doctoral student in applied physics at Harvard University who recently co-authored a primer on carbon removal science and policy.

Instead, said Georgetown University political philosopher Olúfẹ́mi Táíwò, the U.S. should set up a publicly run and managed carbon removal program as part of a much broader decarbonization effort, and include systems for local oversight.

“The speed and direction of deployment of these technologies can’t be up to private industries, can’t be up to Chevron, and can’t be up to Exxon,” Táíwò said, referring to the two largest U.S. oil companies. “We need public management and non-market control.”

Such efforts could, as University at Buffalo researcher Holly Jean Buck put it, “decolonize the atmosphere.”

Heated Geopolitics

It remains unclear whether Singh’s statement ultimately marks a fundamental shift on India’s climate negotiating position or a rift within Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration.

Despite building more solar, India was courting private investment to open 41 new coal mines as recently as last summer. Then, last fall, Singh himself announced plans to replace 29 coal plants scheduled to retire in the coming years entirely with renewables. But this Thursday, the government put out a notice delaying the deadline by which coal-fired plants need to adopt new emissions standards by three years.

“There is ZERO evidence thus far that India is taking meaningful actions to rethink its development trajectory, so that it can focus on poverty alleviation and human development needs of its poor, while trying to rein-in the emissions of the richest 10%,” said Prakash Kashwan, a political scientist and climate policy expert at the University of Connecticut. “On the contrary, the government’s actions on the environmental front seem driven by the present government’s intent to serve the crony capitalist regime that funds the obscenely expensive election campaigns of the ruling party.”

Singh suggested India and other developing countries should not be forced to cut their emissions to zero.

In doing so, it could seek to position itself at the forefront of a new bloc of nations caught in what increasingly looks like a cold war between the U.S. and China. The world’s two largest national emitters and biggest economies joined together in 2014 in what was known as the Group of Two carbon superpowers to agree to cut emissions, setting the stage for the Paris agreement the next year. But so-called G-2 talks sidelined India, which, despite being the world’s third-largest emitter, has grown at a much slower pace than China and occupied a different role in foreign policy circles as a closer ally of the U.S.

Singh did not call out China by name in his speech. But he referred at one point to a 2060 net-zero target ― the deadline by which China agreed to zero out its emissions, a decade later than most countries in the West. That signaled he could be lumping China in alongside other developed countries and is seeking to place India as the largest and most powerful advocate for the rest of the world.

“The U.S.-China conflict is going to continue to intensify for years to come, and other countries, particularly in the Global South, are going to be under pressure from both sides to choose who they are with,” said Tobita Chow, an advocate for progressive U.S. engagement toward China and the director of the nonprofit Justice Is Global. “You’re going to have a set of countries trying to carve out a space that’s independent of that pressure to choose a side. Whether or not that’s what India is after right now is something to look out for.”

It’s a message that could appeal to countries like Mozambique, which generates relatively little income from fossil fuels yet suffered devastating back-to-back cyclones in 2019 that were widely seen as a glimpse of a brutal climate future. Nearly half of Mozambique’s population lives in poverty and less than 25% have access to electricity, according to U.N. statistics.

Countries across Africa, Singh said, “need to develop.”

“That development will require consumption of steel in huge quantities. That development will require consumption of cement in huge quantities. They also want to build skyscrapers. They also want a higher standard of living for their people,” he said, thrusting his hands in the air. “And you can’t stop it because you have already occupied so much carbon space.”

Momeen Rezaei, advisor to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, told Iran's Mehr News Agency on Wednesday that the country needs a major revamp of its security.

""The country has been widely exposed to security violations, and the example is that in less than a year, three security incidents have occurred: two explosions and one assassination,"" explained Rezaei.

He added: ""Before this, documents from our entire nuclear [archive] have been stolen, and before that, a few suspicious drones came and did some work.""

When Mossad smuggled the nuclear archive out of Iran in 2018, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented the alleged evidence that Iran aimed to develop a nuclear weapon. Iran denied this.

Iran nuclear negotiator Abbas Araghchi called Netanyahu's claims at the time: ""A very childish and even a ridiculous play.""

Mohammad Marandi, one of Iran's negotiators in the 2015 nuclear deal, stated that Israel had ""fabricated evidence"".

Rezaei expressed that this week's attack on Natanz was ""a bad event in terms of prestige"" and that ""they did it to break our resistance in diplomacy.""

The United Nations and its aid partners have seen no proof of a declared withdrawal of Eritrean troops from Ethiopia’s Tigray region, according to the world body’s top humanitarian official, who also warned the situation in the embattled region has deteriorated.

The comments by Mark Lowcock during a closed-door UN Security Council meeting on Thursday came more than two weeks after Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said Eritrea had agreed to withdraw the allied forces it had sent into the northern Ethiopian region during the conflict that broke out there in November 2020.

“Unfortunately, I must say that neither the UN nor any of the humanitarian agencies we work with have seen proof of Eritrean withdrawal,” the under-secretary general of humanitarian affairs told the council, according to a text of his speech seen by Al Jazeera.

After months of tension, Abiy sent government forces into Tigray on November 4 to detain and disarm leaders of the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), the then-regional ruling party that for decades dominated Ethiopia’s politics.

The winner of the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize said the move came in response to TPLF-orchestrated attacks on federal army camps. The TPLF said Abiy’s government and its longtime foe Eritrea launched a “coordinated attack” against it.

Abiy declared victory after federal forces entered the regional capital, Mekelle, on November 28 but fighting has continued and analysts warn of a prolonged deadlock in a conflict that is believed to have killed thousands of people and left more than five million people in need of aid.

“The humanitarian situation in Tigray has deteriorated,” said Lowcock, adding that the “vast majority” of the region of some six million people “is completely or partially inaccessible” for humanitarian agencies.

“The conflict is not over and things are not improving,” he continued, calling the “reports of systematic rape, gang rape and sexual violence … especially disturbing and alarmingly widespread”.

Civilians have been experiencing “targeted violence, mass killings and executions, and systematic sexual violence as a weapon of war”.

Thursday’s closed-door meeting was the latest in a number of similar sessions since the start of the conflict more than five months ago, but the Security Council has yet to release a statement.

“The Security Council has listened to these reports, it had closed-door meetings but it has been absolutely silent,” said Al Jazeera’s diplomatic editor James Bays, reporting from the UN headquarters in New York. “Security Council members have not managed to agree to a single statement on the situation.”

Asked by Al Jazeera what should be done to improve the situation in Tigray, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric called for an increase in humanitarian access as well as “real movement” on human rights investigations into the “horrific reports” of atrocities and a “real reconciliation within the different groups in Tigray”.

After months of denials, Abiy last month admitted publicly that Eritrean troops had entered Tigray. UN chief Antonio Guterres once said the prime minister had “guaranteed” Eritrean forces were not there.

This week, Amnesty International said Eritrean troops on Monday had opened fire on civilians in Tigray’s Adwa town, in an “unprovoked” attack that killed at least three people and wounded 19 others.

The rights group’s regional director, Sarah Jackson, described the shooting as “yet another unlawful attack by Eritrean troops on civilians in Tigray”.",575,3698,10,62

Unfortunately, Stalin passed away before he could round up just one last group of intellectuals and make them dig their own mass graves.” Morrison also noted that Stalin likely came closer to creating a communist utopia than any other leader in world history besides China’s Mao Tse-tung, who actually achieved it.",175,1116,13,83
1,Millions Without Power Following Election [Classic],https://politics.theonion.com/millions-without-power-following-election-1819574165,"People all across the country are reporting being without power in the wake of Tuesday’s presidential election.

WASHINGTON—According to widespread reports, roughly 314 million Americans across the country have been left without any power following Tuesday’s devastating presidential election.

As many struggle to cope amidst the continued outage, experts have predicted that due to the severity of the presidential contest, which cut a wide swath of carnage throughout the entire United States, it’s very possible that power won’t be fully restored to the general public for at least another four years, if ever.

“By our estimates, power is out in roughly 150 million homes throughout the country, and many residents—especially the poor, the middle class, and ethnic minorities—will have no power for a long, long time,” said Cornell University political scientist Dr. Paul Kucharski, adding that the power infrastructure, which was originally put in place in 1789, has become increasingly problematic and unreliable over the past 200 years. “Given that we have an outdated system that is so prone to failure, an outage of this magnitude was inevitable.”

“At this point,” he continued, “with the number of citizens whose lives have been completely devastated by this election, I think it’s fairly clear that the whole system needs a complete overhaul.”

Reports of sweeping power failures began surfacing Tuesday in the late evening, with the election wreaking havoc across the entire Eastern Seaboard, first knocking out power in Massachusetts, New York, and Maryland. As more and more results came in and the election grew in intensity, power outages were eventually reported in Pennsylvania, in Indiana, and stretching as far west as Colorado and California.

By approximately 11 p.m., power had reportedly been cut off to all states, including Alaska and Hawaii.

“I was watching the returns on television, they called a winner in my state, and then I was just totally without power,” said 35-year-old Dalton, GA resident Chris Orloff, adding that the election has left him totally in the dark and with no one to turn to. “Even though we were warned the election was going to happen on Nov. 6, there was just no way to avoid this thing.”

“I thought it would be bad, but I honestly didn’t think it would be this bad.” Orloff added. “Best thing to do now is hunker down with my family and get used to not having power for a while.”

According to sources, the power outage has left millions without access to proper health care, adequate shelter, and basic goods and services. Moreover, public school officials said that if the power loss continues—as it is expected to for the foreseeable future—it will be impossible to continue educating students.

Many in the medical community told reporters that the harmful elections and resulting loss of power could lead to a record number of deaths.

Though a majority of Americans said the outage has left them scared and helpless, some were angered, arguing that as taxpayers, they deserve access to power. Others remarked they have simply gotten used to the unstable, highly unreliable electoral system and its long history of knocking out power to citizens when they need it most.

“Unfortunately, we lose power around here all the time,” said Florida-based marketing consultant Erika Lloyd, explaining that she endured a much more crippling power failure in 2000. “Any time an election happens, even if it’s a small, statewide one, our power goes out immediately after the ballots are counted.”

With no end to the crisis in sight, Americans have expressed growing frustration, complaining that they feel completely abandoned by those they rely on to provide them with power.

“People always come around here every three or four years talking about how they’re going to repair the system and restore our power, but then another election happens and it just gets worse,” said 58-year-old mechanic John Rhodes, who, along with other tenants in his government-subsidized housing complex in Camden, NJ, has been living without power for more than four decades. “I mean, look around you. Does it seem like any of the power issues have been addressed here?”

Three aftershocks of a magnitude 4 followed the initial quake, the report said.

The US Geological Survey called the initial temblor a 5.8 magnitude earthquake. It said its depth was 10 kilometers (6.2 miles).

A magnitude 5 earthquake can cause considerable damage. Such shallow earthquakes as Sunday’s also can result in broader damage.

The quake was some 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Iran’s Bushehr nuclear power plant. There was no immediate report on the plant, though the facility was constructed to withstand earthquakes up to magnitude 8.

Iran is on major seismic faults and experiences one earthquake a day on average. In 2003, a magnitude 6.6 earthquake flattened the historic city of Bam, killing 26,000 people.

""It is the largest network we have exposed,"" Alexandre Alaphilippe, executive director of EU DisinfoLab told the BBC after the report “Indian Chronicles” was published on Wednesday.

Brussels-based DisinfoLab is a European NGO which aims to check the disinformation targeting the European Union, its parliamentarians and policies.

In a sophisticated operation, much of which has been linked to the New Delhi-based Srivastava Group, hundreds of fake media outlets, long-dead organisations and stolen identities were used to paint Pakistan in a negative light in the EU and elsewhere, the report says.

The international community needs to take notice of a rogue Indian regime that now threatens the stability of the global system. — Imran Khan (@ImranKhanPTI) December 10, 2020

While DisinfoLab says it has not found any connection between this campaign and the Indian state, Pakistan’s foreign office came out with a strong statement.

“India not only spread disinformation but abused international institutions in its desire to malign Pakistan,” it said.

The revelations could deepen tension further between the two neighbours who have fought three wars and have come close to another full blown conflict last year.

Resurrected to deceive

The DisinfoLab investigation found that at least ten long-defunct NGOs and industry-related organisations were resurrected and used to lobby diplomats at international forums, especially the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC).

For instance, the Commission to Study the Organisation of Peace (CDOP), an NGO that became inactive in the 1970s, was reactivated in the mid-2000s to organise events on the sidelines of UN sessions and send representatives to panel discussions.

Its origin has been linked to Srivastava Group.

In honour of #HumanRightsDay, we want to share a chapter of our recent investigation with implications for @UN_HRC.

What will worry many in Islamabad is that the NGOs in question are UN accredited, something which makes them appear legitimate.

The groups are also responsible for putting up “Free Balochistan” posters across Geneva in 2017. Pakistan’s restive Balochistan province is facing an insurgency, and India often highlights the human rights violations there to deviate attention from its own atrocities in Kashmir.

The International Club for Peace Research (ICPR), another dormant NGO that focuses on Africa, was resurrected in 2009 when it started to appear at the UNHRC sessions where Pakistan was targeted.

It was this so-called NGO which in 2012 issued a press release, distributed by Indian news agency DNA, demanding “enquiry into genocide in Bangladesh by Pakistani Army.”

“The (ICPR) website refers to promoting peace and to Mother Teresa in its “about us” section, lists past events and meetings related to peace and human rights in Africa, but its “news”, “pictures” and “demonstrations” sections are entirely about human rights in Pakistan,” DisinfoLab says.

The groups ostensibly lobby around issues that are sure to cause discontent within Pakistan.

“Generally, we found several other NGOs regularly covering the same issues around minorities in Pakistan, Balochistan, Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan. For a majority of these NGOs, these issues are not part of their original mission,” it notes.

For instance, in the southern Sindh province there’s strong resentment against the construction of upstream dams. But despite it being a domestic matter, the World Sindhi Congress was invited by one of the groups at the 2018 UNHRC to speak against the dam.

The report has also raised questions about the performance of UN bureaucracy as organisations set up to represent industry groups ended up in the hands of Indians and later used solely as tools to bash Pakistan.

Take for example the Canners International Permanent Committee (CIPC), which was established to promote the canning industry but stopped functioning in 2007. It was later reactivated by the same Indian network.

“The core theme of the original NGO – “canned foods” - was totally diverted by Indian Chronicles to undermine Pakistan at the Human Rights Council,” says DisinfoLab.

Another interesting example is of the African Regional Agricultural Credit Association (ARACA), which instead of proposing ways to help farmers, has used Geneva for anti-Pakistan activities.

A Pakistani dissident, Mehran Marri, also known as Mehran Baluch, who has more than 27,000 followers on Twitter, has spoken on behalf of ARACA.

Marri, who supports Balochistan’s secession from Pakistan, has also served as the President of Balochistan House, an organisation linked to Ankit Srivastava of the Srivastava Group.

“NGOs tied to this ecosystem are also often represented by official representatives of minorities in Pakistan, who can be seen to speak for different organizations,” notes DisinfoLab.

The media connection

The Indian disinformation network relies heavily on more than 700 fake media outlets to spread propaganda of the NGOs linked to Srivastava Group.

Fake news websites such as EU Chronicles, Japan Times Today, and Arizona Herald, regularly published Pakistan-centric stories.

The DisinfoLab found that the Indian news wire agency, ANI, a partner organisation of Reuters, often helped magnify the stories published by these outlets.

Once sent out by ANI, these stories were picked up by respectable media groups such as The Times of India and The Economic Times.

A glaring example of how the propaganda works can be seen in the 2017 interview of the Pakistani diplomat Hussain Haqqani published in another fake outlet, Times of Geneva.

The story titled ‘Baloch posters in Switzerland to isolate Pakistan’ was picked up by ANI and forwarded to its subscribers. It ended up on the webpages of Outlook India magazine and the Business Standard.

REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/File Photo

India’s capital New Delhi recorded 24,000 coronavirus cases in a 24-hour period and is facing an acute shortage of hospital beds, its chief minister said on Saturday, as the country overall recorded more than 200,000 cases for a third day.

""The situation is very critical, worrying. Oxygen is in short supply,"" said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, adding that almost one in four tests for the virus were giving a positive result.

""Beds equipped with oxygen supplies, and for critical care, are filling fast,"" he added.

New Delhi, which has imposed a weekend curfew, is among the worst hit cities in India, where a second major wave of coronavirus infections is straining health infrastructure.

In recent weeks, criticism has mounted over how the federal government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has handled the health crisis, as religious festivals and election rallies continue despite reports of shortages of hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and vaccination doses.

India reported 234,692 COVID-19 infections over the last 24 hours, taking the total number of cases to nearly 14.5 million, second only to the United States. Deaths from the disease rose by 1,341 to 175,649.

After imposing one of the world's strictest lockdowns for nearly three months last year, India’s government relaxed almost all curbs by the beginning of 2021, although many regions like New Delhi and state of Maharashtra have introduced localised restrictions.

""This is Narendra Modi’s biggest crisis yet. It is bigger than any security threat, external or internal, or even the economic attrition of 2020,"" political commentator Shekhar Gupta wrote in a column on Saturday.

VACCINATIONS, DRUG SUPPLIES

As complaints rise about slow vaccination rollout and shortages, Federal Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Saturday said 125 million doses have already been administered and 11.6 million doses would be made available in a week.

Some local governments - including in the New Delhi city - have raised concerns over shortages and hoarding of anti-viral drug Remdesivir. read more

Nawab Malik, a minister from Maharashtra, accused Modi's federal government on Twitter for restricting Remdesivir supplies to the state. A minister in Modi's cabinet, Mansukh Mandaviya, denied the allegation, saying adequate supplies were being arranged.

Mandaviya said on Twitter the government had intervened and prices of Remdesivir injections have been significantly reduced.

RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL, ELECTION RALLIES

After hundreds of thousands of ascetics and devout Hindus gathered for several days along the banks of the Ganges for a religious festival Kumbh Mela, Modi on Saturday called for restraint, saying on Twitter the festival should now be kept ""symbolic"".

Responding to Modi's appeal, one of the religious leaders Swami Avdheshanand urged devotees to not gather in large numbers. Devout Hindus believe bathing in the holy Ganges absolves people of sins, and during the Kumbh Mela, brings salvation from the cycle of life and death.

Those returning to Mumbai from the Kumbh Mela will have to quarantine, the city mayor said.

Experts have warned about the spread of more contagious variants of the disease, especially during large-scale gatherings for religious festivals and political rallies.

On Saturday, Modi was scheduled to hold two rallies in eastern state of West Bengal where state polls are ongoing. In recent weeks, such rallies have attracted thousands of people, few of whom follow COVID-19 safety protocols.

""Stop spreader rallies,"" the Times of India said in an editorial on Saturday, adding: ""Business as usual is an unaffordable luxury until this virus is conclusively tamed.""

The match was censored over “100 times,” according to My Stealthy Freedom, an Iranian rights group that opposes Iran’s compulsory hijab law.

During the Premier League match between Tottenham and Manchester United on Sunday, an Iranian state channel cut away from the game and played footage of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and the backstreets of North London in an effort to conceal shots of assistant referee Sian Massey-Ellis, who was wearing shorts.

At the end of the game, a commentator reportedly quipped that “he hoped the viewers enjoyed the geographic show,” according to My Stealthy Freedom.

Due to Teheran’s strict censorship laws, TV scenes deemed immoral or offensive are often censored, while films considered hostile to Islamic values are banned.

“Censorship is in the DNA of the Islamic Republic of Iran. We should not normalize this practice. This is not our culture. This is the ideology of a repressive regime,” the rights organization said in a statement on Facebook.

Since the Islamic Revolution of 1979, it became mandatory for women to wear a hijab and modest clothing in public, a move enforced by the Islamic religious police of Iran, known as Guidance Patrol.

Local programs must normally abide by strict rules in which no female hair can be shown, even in historical dramas or scenes set in a family home where real-life women do not cover their heads.

Iranian TV shows foreign films with unscarved women — although too much leg or cleavage gets blurred out or otherwise hidden.

Iran also has a contentious history with its female soccer fans.

In 2019, Iranian women were allowed into a Tehran stadium for the first time in decades to watch the 2022 World Cup qualifier between the Iranian national team and Cambodia at Tehran’s Azadi Stadium. This event marked a decades-long push by Iranian women to be able to watch matches, something hardliners in Iran’s Shiite theocracy still oppose.

Iran allocated 4,000 tickets for women in a stadium that seats about 80,000 people, keeping them separated from men and under the protection of female police officers. That’s even though face-painted Iranian women have cheered for their team abroad for years despite the 1981 ban that followed the country’s Islamic Revolution.",452,2777,13,78

Reuters News (TRI.TO) on Thursday unveiled a new subscription website as part of a broad initiative to court business professionals.

In addition to targeting its current global readership, the newly revamped Reuters.com is hoping to attract professional audiences prepared to pay $34.99 per month for a deeper level of coverage and data on industry verticals that include legal, sustainable business, healthcare and autos.

Reuters.com will remain free for a preview period, but will require users to register after five stories. It is not immediately clear when it will begin charging.

The Thomson Reuters-owned news division now joins a crowded market of major news organizations which already charge for their content.

Among them, financial news rival Bloomberg.com charges $34.99 per month before discounts, while the Wall Street Journal, which in 1996 became the first to launch a paywall, charges $38.99.

In an emailed statement, Josh London, Chief Marketing Officer, Reuters and Head of Reuters Professional, called the launch ""the largest digital transformation at Reuters in a decade.""

He added: ""Professionals need direct access to industry knowledge, data and insights from expert sources, and Reuters is pleased to offer our trusted, impartial and accurate news coverage through a premium offering.""

Reuters President Michael Friedenberg and newly appointed Editor in Chief Alessandra Galloni have said the success of the digital and events business is one of their top priorities. read more

Ken Doctor, a veteran media analyst and founder of local news and information company Lookout Local Inc, characterized the introduction of the paywall as ""late, but not too late,"" noting that Bloomberg only started charging for its site in 2018.

""The critical question is to a business news consumer, what added value do I get from Reuters that I don't get from Bloomberg or Dow Jones?"" he added.

Reuters generates around half of its revenue from its biggest client, financial data specialist Refinitiv.

Refinitiv was part of Thomson Reuters until 2018 when a majority stake was purchased by private equity firm Blackstone Group LP in a deal valuing the business at about $20 billion. It was then sold to the London Stock Exchange Group Plc in a $27 billion all-stock deal that closed this year.

Reuters also licenses text, video, pictures, data and graphics to media companies, which, in many cases, offer the content for free to consumers, as well as to tech companies and corporations. And it generates advertising revenue from the website, which attracts around 41 million unique visitors monthly.

The digital operation is one prong of its plan to court professionals that also includes live events, newsletters, channels on streaming TV services Roku and Plex and on audio through Amazon.com Inc, the company has said.

Toronto-headquartered Thomson Reuters invested what several former executives have estimated at $20 million less than a decade ago to rebuild the website. It pulled the plug on the plan in 2013 as it was ""far away from commercial viability or strategic success,"" former Reuters CEO Andrew Rashbass told employees in an internal memo at the time.

A Reuters spokeswoman declined to comment on the investment figure.

The new iteration of the digital strategy includes a deeper investment in areas such as legal news, where it has added journalists and launched new products, including daily newsletters. It will also offer live streams of Reuters events to subscribers.

0,New Zealand wants to ban cigarette sales to anyone born after 2004 as part of plan to make nation ‘smoke free’ by 2025,https://www.rt.com/news/521201-new-zealand-cigarettes-smoking-ban/,"New Zealand is currently mulling a series of proposals aimed at eliminating smoking in the country, including a radical initiative that would prohibit the sale of tobacco to an entire generation.

Under the country’s Smokefree Aotearoa 2025 Action Plan, New Zealand hopes to gradually increase the legal smoking age and ultimately prohibit cigarette sales to anyone born after 2004. The initiative also calls for a significant reduction in the level of nicotine allowed in tobacco and places restrictions on where cigarettes can be sold. The government would also set a minimum price for all tobacco products.

As the name of the plan suggests, the goal is to phase out tobacco use in the country over the next few years, creating a “smoke free” New Zealand by 2025. The country’s Health Ministry explained that while smoking rates have declined over the past decade, “much work still needs to be done,” particularly to reduce tobacco use among “Maori, Pacific peoples and those living in our most disadvantaged communities.”

New Zealanders have been invited to “provide feedback” about the action plan, which was formally released on Thursday. Residents will have until May 31 to share their thoughts on the matter before it enters the next phase towards becoming law.

Also on rt.com New Zealand PM urges public to ‘call out’ family & friends who break Covid-19 rules, who let down ‘team of five million’

Associate Health Minister Ayesha Verrall said that around 4,500 New Zealanders die each year from tobacco-related ailments and that the government was committed to “accelerated progress” in its fight against smoking.

“We need a new approach… Business-as-usual without a tobacco control program won’t get us there,” Verall argued.

While the initiative has been hailed by some advocacy groups, it is not without its critics. Some have warned that limiting the sale of tobacco would bankrupt shop owners. The restrictions could also fuel an unregulated black market for tobacco products. The government has even acknowledged that the amount of tobacco products smuggled into the country has “increased substantially” in recent years.

0,China dollar issuers face pressure on Huarong debt concerns,https://www.reuters.com/article/china-huarong-bonds/china-dollar-issuers-face-pressure-on-huarong-debt-concerns-idUSL1N2M809G,"SHANGHAI, April 15 (Reuters) - An index of China dollar issuers fell to a 10-month low this week as concerns increase over Chinese issuers’ creditworthiness after asset management giant China Huarong Asset Management Co delayed the release of its annual results.

The delay by a company that counts China’s Ministry of Finance as its biggest shareholder has prompted worries that any restructuring could leave holders of its U.S. dollar bonds unprotected, raising doubts about the creditworthiness of Chinese issuers even as foreign investors have flocked to the market.

The ICE Bank of America Asian Dollar Investment Grade Corporate China Issuers Index was last at 212.756, its lowest level since June 15, 2020, and down 2.5% from a record high in February.

Huarong, a manager of non-performing loans set up by the government two decades ago and one of China’s four biggest asset management companies (AMCs), has had its Hong Kong shares suspended since March 31 after it announced a delay in its earnings report due to a “relevant transaction” yet to be finalised.

The yield on a February 2030 dollar bond of Huarong’s subsidiary’s Huarong Finance 2019 Co was last quoted at 10.154%, up from 3.775% on March 31.

The company and its subsidiaries currently have outstanding bonds worth $51.72 billion, of which $16.59 billion is due to mature this year, according to Refinitiv data.

“The offshore bond price continues to slide as there are no rumours, or proposals, or anything about how to deal with (Huarong’s) offshore debts,” said a fund manager in Hong Kong.

Calls to Huarong went unanswered on Thursday.

Global rating agencies Moody’s and Fitch this week placed Huarong’s ratings on review for possible downgrades, citing uncertainty following the company’s delayed results.

Worries have spilled into the broader market, lifting the cost of insurance against a default in China’s dollar debt to its highest since October.

The ITRAXX credit default swap index for Asia has widened to 80 basis points (bps), from 63 a week ago.

Onshore investors have displayed more faith in Huarong’s ability to meet its obligations, with the spread of one-year AA rated corporate debt over the government benchmark rising less than 3 basis points over the past month.

Analysts also see little risk of a major debt restructuring.

“We see poor risk-reward for a major debt restructuring, particularly given no urgent need ... Our recent channel check with banks also shows a clear signal of no major debt restructuring from policymakers. Hence, we expect a manageable impact on the system,” analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note.

Huarong faced financing challenges and a sell-off in its stock in 2018 after then-chairman Lai Xiaomin was targeted in an anti-corruption investigation.

It has been under a spotlight this year since Lai was executed in January following his conviction on bribery charges.

A Tianjin court found Lai guilty of taking a record 1.79 billion yuan in bribes, colluding with others to embezzle 25.1 million yuan of public funds, and bigamy, in the country’s biggest financial corruption case since the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949.

Under Lai’s tenure, Huarong expanded rapidly to become a broader financial holding company, and created a massive pile of distressed debt through its investments during the period.

As of mid-2020, Huarong had 160 billion yuan in net assets, and more than 30 billion yuan in loan-loss provisions. ($1 = 6.5387 Chinese yuan) (Reporting by Andrew Galbraith in Shanghai; Additional reporting by Cheng Leng in Beijing; Editing by Kim Coghill)",583,3623,9,59

Alejandro Dominguez, the President of South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) said the immunization “will be focused on the principal squads of South American professional (teams) in top divisions, both male and female.""

“This is the best news the South American football family could receive,” he added. “It’s a big step forward in beating the COVID-19 pandemic but it doesn’t mean we are going to let our guard down.”

Dominguez said the deal was brokered by Uruguayan president Luis Lacalle Pou and other Uruguayan officials.

He gave no details of how and when the doses would arrive or be administered but thanked Sinovac for “understanding that football is a key activity for the economy, culture and mental and physical health of South Americans.”

The agreement comes at a key moment for football in the region. The two main club competitions, the Copa Libertadores and Copa Sudamericana are underway and involve significant travel across a massive continent.

The Copa America is also due to kick off in two months’ time, with the tournament being co-hosted for the first time as both Argentina and Colombia are staging matches.

However, the pandemic is still raging across the continent, with Argentina last week tightening restrictions on movement after the number of cases soared and Brazil earlier this month seeing its daily death toll exceed 4,000 for the first time.

Speaking to CONMEBOL delegates in Paraguay, Dominguez said he hoped fans would be allowed in to watch Copa America matches.",274,1728,13,88

The latest polls are out, and just as I predicted, I’m leading the Republican presidential race by a wide margin. You might be wondering how that could be. After all, it’s hardly been a month since I entered the field and I’ve already alienated America’s largest immigrant population, seen dozens of my high-profile business deals implode one after the other, and publicly insulted a national hero’s military service, all while not offering a single viable policy idea. But none of that matters at all, and my candidacy continues to surge forward, because none of you—not a single one of you—can look away. Not even for a second.

Admit it: You people want to see just how far this goes, don’t you?



My campaign’s just barely begun and I’ve already got you begging for more. Sure, you can say you oppose me or that you don’t even take me seriously. But let me ask you: How many articles have you read about Ted Cruz lately? How many news segments have you watched on Bobby Jindal? Or Rand Paul? But if those stories have the name “Donald Trump” in them, well, look who suddenly can’t get enough.



The thing is, I’ve got all of you eating out of my hand and I haven’t even released a single campaign commercial yet. Don’t look me in the eye and tell me you don’t want to stick around and see what that looks like, because you and I both know these ads are going to be absolutely incredible. I’ll be standing there projecting my best presidential air, saying “I’m Donald Trump, and I approve this message,” and you won’t be able to take your eyes off it.



You keep obsessing over every little thing I do and say, and I promise you’ll get your commercials real soon.



I can tell you’re practically salivating right now. And I’m going to keep riding this fascination, this little fixation you have with me as far as you’ll take me. You know I will.

You’ll absolutely eat it up when you see the “Trump ’16” T-shirts, the lawn signs, the bumper stickers; in fact, you’ll probably get a real kick out of pointing them out to your friends. Now, just imagine me shaking hands with senior citizens at a nursing home in Iowa. Wouldn’t you love to watch that?

Just take a moment and imagine the primary debates: Jeb Bush; Chris Christie; me. Of course, they’ll put me in the middle because I’m ahead in the polls—far ahead at the moment. You already know how I answer even the most basic inquiries, so just picture me staring down the barrel of a question about foreign affairs or agriculture policy or something like that. You think you won’t sit there with bated breath while I try to tackle a question about using military force, or about food stamps, or about how my faith influences my decision-making? I guarantee you that my answers will be worth watching. And we both know you wouldn’t miss them for the world. It’d be the biggest, most-watched primary debate in history, courtesy of all of you.



And might I remind you that the longer this goes on, the closer I get to selecting a running mate. That realization kind of delighted you in a way, didn’t it? You absolutely want to know who I’d pick. A defeated GOP challenger who hates my guts? Another lunatic billionaire? Maybe my own son, Donald Trump Jr.? Whatever your wildest expectation is, I promise you I will surpass it. You’re not going to pass up an opportunity to see that, are you?

0,Anger as Tory MPs vote against register for stalkers and domestic abusers. Government rejects measures despite briefing they would support them after death of Sarah Everard,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/apr/16/anger-tory-mps-vote-against-register-stalkers-domestic-abusers,"The government is facing growing anger after voting against putting serial stalkers and domestic abusers on a national register, despite briefing they were likely to support the measures following the death of Sarah Everard.

Conservative MPs voted against amendments to the domestic abuse bill on Thursday that would have placed serial domestic abusers and stalkers on the current Violent and Sex Offender Register (Visor).

MPs also voted down House of Lords-supported amendments that would have given family court judges training on sexual abuse and provided greater protection to migrant victims of domestic violence.

The stalking amendment gained overwhelming support in the Lords last month and the home secretary, Priti Patel, suggested the government was likely to support the measures, telling MPs: “There is something about perpetrators and their serial offending that has to be addressed. There is no question about that at all … I will be very candid: we will look at all measures.”

After the death of Sarah Everard, government sources told the Sunday Times that the move also had the backing of the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, while a Change.org petition urging the government to introduce the stalkers’ register has attracted almost 250,000 signatures.

All but two Conservative MPs voted against the amendment to add persistent stalkers and domestic abusers to a national register. It was defeated 351 to 227.

Domestic abuse and stalking survivors and campaigners were disappointed and frustrated, said Sophie Francis-Cansfield, the senior campaigns and policy officer at Women’s Aid.

“Domestic abuse remains underreported and only a small proportion of survivors see criminal sanctions against their perpetrator – a register could have been a useful tool,” she said. “We have to find ways to proactively hold perpetrators to account and prioritise survivors’ safety.”

The domestic abuse campaigner David Challen, whose mother, Sally Challen, spent decades as a victim of her husband’s coercive and controlling behaviour, said the government was putting countless lives at risk by not creating a register to monitor abusers. “Abusers and stalkers commit a pattern of violent acts across multiple victims, this register was a vital opportunity to track and stop this violence,” he said.

The decision to exclude migrant women from protections offered under the new bill was “deeply troubling”, said Pragna Patel of Southall Black Sisters, which is taking part in a government pilot project to support migrant women and address an “evidence gap” around the need for support. “Copious evidence already exists,” she said. “The pilot is no substitute to the need for meaningful, long-term measures of protection for some of the most vulnerable women in our society. We will not be celebrating the bill when it becomes law because it is not a bill for all women.”

Jess Phillips, the shadow domestic violence minister, said the decision to vote against the amendments pointed to a government “hellbent on working with a clearly broken system that leaves violent criminals without management and has already left many women for dead”.

The decision to exclude migrant women from protections offered to other victims in the bill was “driven by ideology rather than reality”, she said, adding: “Foreign students, people working in our care system and across our country completely legally have been offered up a narrow system that will inevitably leave many with no choice but to return to violence and abuse.”

Lucy Hadley, the head of policy and campaigns at Women’s Aid, said it was “deeply disappointing” that the government had rejected the Lords’ amendments to give migrant women equal protection, adding that currently just 4% of refuges in England could accept a woman with no recourse to public funds due to immigration status. “All survivors must have the right to seek help and live a life free from abuse – regardless of their immigration status,” she said. “This law has been deemed a once-in-a-generation opportunity to protect all survivors, but there is much more to do.”

The government’s decision to vote down a requirement for all family court judges to have training on domestic abuse and sexual violence was “unbelievable”, said Dr Charlotte Proudman, an expert on gender-based violence and family law.

“I’m devastated,” she said. “The government’s harm report and three domestic abuse appeals show that the family courts are failing women and children leaving them in situations of harm.”

A government spokesperson said: “There has been no U-turn. The Lords amendment is not calling for a register, but instead changes to multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA).

“The government agrees that high-harm domestic abuse perpetrators need to be effectively monitored and supervised, which is why serial and high-harm domestic abuse offenders are eligible for management under MAPPA. Adding a new category of offenders automatically eligible for MAPPA risks adding complexity to those arrangements without any gain.”",789,5066,26,172

It took less than two weeks for the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan to vaccinate almost all of its eligible population.

The country's vaccination campaign kicked off on March 27. By April 8, according to the Ministry of Health, 93% of eligible adults had gotten their first dose. Officials said 472,139 people between ages 18 and 104 had been vaccinated as of that date, and they urged other eligible individuals to follow suit.

In a statement, Health Minister Dasho Dechen Wangmo described the campaign as a ""sense of purpose that each of us is embracing to protect our country and the people we love."" She urged individuals to get vaccinated to protect themselves and their communities — as well as King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck.

""His Majesty the King has shared thoughts about taking the vaccine only after every eligible person in the country received their shots safely,"" she said. ""All of us must come forward, so that we make way for His Majesty to receive the vaccine as soon as possible.""

Overall, roughly 64% of Bhutan's 735,553 residents have been vaccinated so far. That puts the nation's rollout just behind that of Seychelles, which has vaccinated 66% of its population of nearly 100,000, according to The Associated Press.

Health officials said second doses will be administered after eight to 12 weeks. The country received 550,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, known locally as Covishield, in two batches in January and March from India, Daily Bhutan reported.

Bhutan launched its vaccination campaign at the end of last month to coincide with ""auspicious dates in Buddhist astrology,"" the AP said. On March 27, a 30-year-old bureaucrat became the country's first COVID-19 vaccine recipient, followed by Prime Minister Lotay Tshering, his family members and various cabinet ministers.

""Given the infection rate of the disease, we need above 70 percent coverage in order to attain the desired herd immunity,"" Tshering said in a statement. ""With the overwhelming support of all Bhutanese, we will be one of the first countries to achieve that.""

The vaccines were distributed to more than 1,200 sites across the country using cold-chain storage that the AP says was used during earlier vaccination drives. Nearly 3,300 health workers and 4,400 citizen volunteers known as desuups were deployed across the country to help with the rollout, the Health Ministry said.

More than 85% of the country's eligible adults had received their first dose within seven days, officials said. While the formal vaccination campaign was set to last only one week, shots were still available at certain health centers for people who had not received them, and individuals with mobility issues can sign up for home-based vaccinations until Tuesday.

State-owned newspaper Kuensel stated in an editorial that the country's efforts to fight the coronavirus pandemic have been ""exemplary right from the beginning,"" thanks to leadership, front-line workers and what the paper describes as a cooperative public.

While noting it's premature to celebrate before people have had their second doses, it said that the country's size had certainly contributed to the vaccine's successful rollout — and that this has implications for tackling other issues related to the economy, unemployment and technology.

""As we realise the advantage of our smallness from the vaccination programme, it is a lesson too valuable to not replicate in our other endeavours,"" it concluded.

As of Monday, the country had recorded 921 cases and one death from COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. Health officials said there will be no changes to public health restrictions until at least two weeks after the country completes a rollout of second-dose vaccinations, in two to three months.",631,3939,10,57

0,Senate Democrats urge Biden to deny funds for Brazil Amazon,https://www.thestar.com/news/world/americas/2021/04/16/senate-democrats-urge-biden-to-deny-funds-for-brazil-amazon.html,"RIO DE JANEIRO - More than a dozen Senate Democrats sent a letter to U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday complaining of a woeful environmental track record by his Brazilian counterpart, Jair Bolsonaro, and urging him to condition any support for Amazon preservation on significant progress reducing deforestation.

The letter was signed by senators including Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and Bob Menendez, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. It comes just days before Biden is expected to meet with Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders at a U.S.-organized climate summit that was a major plank of his campaign pledge to more aggressively fight climate change.

The letter seems aimed at curtailing a fledgling bid by Bolsonaro, a far-right climate skeptic who was a staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, to refashion himself as a willing partner of Biden on the environment in the hopes of securing billions of dollars in foreign aid to promote sustainable development in the Amazon.

The senators warn that failure to slow deforestation will also affect their willingness to support Brazil’s bid to join the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development — a long-sought goal of Bolsonaro.

The 15 senators, who also include former presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, said they support co-operation on the Amazon between the U.S. and Brazilian governments, but questioned Bolsonaro’s credibility.

“President Bolsonaro’s rhetoric and policies have effectively given a green light to the dangerous criminals operating in the Amazon, allowing them to dramatically expand their activities, ” the senators wrote in the letter obtained by The Associated Press, citing recent reporting on abuses by Human Rights Watch.

A U.S.-Brazil partnership “can only be possible if the Bolsonaro administration begins to take Brazil’s climate commitments seriously — and only if it protects, supports, and engages meaningfully with the many Brazilians who can help the country fulfil them,” the lawmakers add.

Bolsonaro has sided with powerful agribusiness interests, cast aspersions on environmental activists and snarled at European leaders who decried deforestation in the Amazon as destruction of the world’s largest rainforest has surged toward its worst level since 2008.

On the campaign trail, Biden proposed countries provide Brazil with $20 billion to fight deforestation and said the country should face repercussions if it fails. At the time, Bolsonaro labeled Biden’s comments as “regrettable” and “disastrous.”

Bilateral talks on the environment with Brazil began on Feb. 17, led by Biden’s special climate envoy, John Kerry, The two sides have held regular technical meetings in the run-up to the April 22-23 climate summit, which is taking place online due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Brazil is striving to show its shift in rhetoric amounts to more than empty talk.

In a seven-page letter addressed to Biden on April 14, Bolsonaro recognized that his government needs to boost its performance curtailing illegal logging. He also said he supports sustainable development with economic alternatives for the region’s impoverished residents and that he is committed to eliminating illegal deforestation by 2030.

To accomplish those goals, he said Brazil will require outside resources, adding that aid from the U.S. government would be “very welcome.”

Rubens Barbosa, a former Brazilian ambassador to the U.S., said it remains to be seen whether the tone of Bolsonaro’s letter will match his speech at the summit.

Brazil’s Environment Minister Ricardo Salles recently told reporters he is seeking $1 billion in foreign assistance to support efforts to reduce deforestation by 30% to 40% in 12 months and that, without that sum, he would be unable to set a target. Brazilian spending to protect the environment has been sliding for years, and under Bolsonaro the ministry’s budget outlook plunged another 25% this year, the lowest level in two decades.

The ministry didn’t respond to an AP request for comment about its proposals.

The U.S. senators argue Biden must see success before writing a check. They argue Bolsonaro has derided the environmental regulator and sabotaged its enforcement capabilities, sought to weaken protections for Indigenous territories, exhibited contempt for environmentalists and been reluctant to curb lawlessness that fuels destruction and violence.

“Any U.S. assistance to Brazil related to the Amazon should be conditioned on the Brazilian government making significant and sustained progress in two critical areas: reducing deforestation and ending impunity for environmental crimes and acts of intimidation and violence against forest defenders,” the senators wrote.

Climatologists have warned that continued deforestation will push the Amazon beyond a tipping point, and its subsequent decomposition would release hundreds of billions of tons of carbon dioxide, making the Paris Agreement’s climate goals even harder to achieve.

However, Brazil has shown itself capable of driving down Amazon deforestation in the past, having reached all-time low in 2012. That started ticking upwards in the years thereafter, then exploded in the first year of Bolsonaro’s administration and rose again last year.

Amid outcry from European governments and threats of divestment by institutional investors, Bolsonaro in 2019 placed the army in charge of tamping down deforestation, despite experts’ criticism that soldiers are both costly and untrained for such missions.

Preliminary data indicates deforestation has started declining from its record level, though it remains well above the average of the preceding decade. Vice-President Hamilton Mourão, a general who leads the program, announced earlier that the army-led program will end at the end of April, returning enforcement duties to environmental agencies.

“Brazilian officials have been scrambling to present Bolsonaro as a committed ally of the Biden administration on climate issues,” said Daniel Wilkinson, who runs Human Rights Watch’s environmental program. “His new climate-friendly rhetoric simply cannot — and should not — be taken seriously in the absence of actual results.”

The senators’ rebuke comes amid a flurry of domestic efforts in Brazil to cast Bolsonaro’s administration as a bad-faith negotiator.

More than 200 nongovernment organizations and networks signed a letter that said climate negotiations with the U.S. and other foreign governments are taking place out of the public view and that no Amazon solutions can be expected from closed-door meetings. They said talks shouldn’t advance until Brazil has cut deforestation rates.

A video produced by the Association of Brazil’s Indigenous Peoples also warned Biden not to trust Bolsonaro to negotiate the Amazon’s future.

Barbosa, who was Brazil’s ambassador to the U.S. for both centre-right and leftist governments from 1999 to 2004, said Bolsonaro will face difficulty overcoming the “credibility gap” created by his newfound discourse about fighting deforestation and the negative results of the last few years.

“Those two things must be reconciled,” he said. “Until then, no one will enter into serious negotiations with Brazil to transfer resources.”

0,Russian Prosecutors Seek to Label Navalny Groups as 'Extremist',https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/04/16/russian-prosecutors-seek-to-label-navalny-groups-as-extremist-a73631,"They requested that Navalny's network of regional offices and his Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) be added to the list of ""terrorist and extremist"" organizations run by Russia's National Anti-Terrorism Committee.

Russian prosecutors on Friday asked a Moscow court to designate organizations linked to jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny as ""extremist"" in a move that could ban them in Russia and result in jail time for their members.

Navalny's supporters have faced increasing pressure in recent months after the opposition politician returned to Russia in January from Germany.

The list currently consists of 33 organizations and includes the Islamic State, the Taliban and Jehovah's Witnesses. The presence of these groups is banned in Russia and participation in them can result in lengthy prison terms.

It also accused the organizations of creating conditions for ""changing the foundations of the constitutional order"" and called their activities ""undesirable.""

""Under the disguise of liberal slogans, these organizations are engaged in creating conditions for the destabilization of the social and socio-political situation,"" the Moscow prosecutor's office said in a statement.

The 44-year-old spent five months there recovering from a near-fatal poisoning attack that he says was carried out on the orders of President Vladimir Putin.

Navalny was arrested on his return to Moscow and sentenced to two-and-a-half years behind bars on old embezzlement charges, sparking nationwide protests that saw more than 11,000 people detained by police.

His allies, however, vow to carry on.

'Mass political repression'

""Putin has just announced full-scale mass political repression in Russia,"" key aide and head of Navalny's regional network Leonid Volkov wrote on Twitter shortly after the announcement from prosecutors.

In a statement on Facebook, Volkov and FBK director Ivan Zhdanov said they had no doubts about the ruling that a ""Putin's court"" will make but said they will continue their work ""peacefully, publicly and effectively.""

Founded in 2011, FBK has already had its assets frozen in 2019 and received multiple fines over non-compliance with Russia's ""foreign agent"" law.

FBK has published numerous investigations into the wealth of Russia's elite, usually accompanying by YouTube videos.

In January, the FBK team published a two-hour investigation into a lavish palace on the Black Sea allegedly belonging to Putin, which garnered over 115 million views.

Navalny's allies and organizations are subject to frequent police raids and arrests over their political activities.

Earlier on Friday, a Moscow court sentenced to two years in jail a Navalny ally working for FBK over the publication of ""extremist"" tweets.

On Thursday, key aide Lyubov Sobol was handed one year of community service for trying to enter the home of an alleged security agent that Navalny said took part in his poisoning.

On March 31, Navalny announced a hunger strike in his penal colony, demanding adequate medical treatment for pain in his back and numbness in his legs.

His team on Monday said that Russian prison officials had threatened to start force-feeding him.

Navalny, who has lost significant weight since arriving at the facility in February, reiterated in an Instagram post on Friday that the prison authorities are threatening to force feed him.",513,3362,9,63

Soon, the cool rivers will turn to burning acrid pools, and our dairy supply will be threatened as cows go mad and stampede to their deaths. This could cut agribusiness earnings as much as 60% in the third quarter.” At press time, Censky was urging all Americans to burn any unmarried women over the age of 40, lest there be a witch in our midst.

National television published a photo and identified the man as 43-year-old Reza Karimi, saying the intelligence ministry established his role in last week’s “sabotage” at Natanz.

The broadcaster said the suspect had “fled the country before the incident” and that “legal procedures to arrest and return him to the country are currently underway.”

The report also aired what appeared to be an Interpol “red notice” seeking his arrest. A red notice is a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender or similar legal action, according to Interpol’s website.

Neither state TV nor other media provided further details on the suspect, and the intelligence ministry has not issued an official statement.

The ultra-conservative Kayhan daily reported in its Sunday edition that “intelligence and judicial authorities” are engaged in the process.

It added that “after his identity was established, necessary measures were taken through Interpol to arrest and return” the suspect.

Kayhan did not specify what form of Interpol assistance had been requested.

Contacted by AFP in Lyon, Interpol did not confirm or deny such a request being filed by Iran.

“Interpol does not… comment on specific cases or individuals except in special circumstances and with the approval of the member country concerned,” it said.

As of Sunday noon, Interpol’s public “red notice” list online returned no results for Reza Karimi.

Last year, following an earlier blast at the Natanz site that was also attributed to Israel, Iran named another Karimi as a suspect — Ershad Karimi, a contractor at the nuclear facility who owns a company, MEHR, that supplies precision measuring equipment.

According to Israel’s Channel 13, Ershad Karimi was never found.

The April 11 attack at Natanz was initially described only as a blackout in the electrical grid feeding aboveground workshops and underground enrichment halls, but Iranian officials later began calling it an attack.

On Monday, an Iranian official acknowledged that the blast took out the plant’s main electrical power system and its backup. “From a technical standpoint, the enemy’s plan was rather beautiful,” Fereydoon Abbasi Davani, the head of the Iranian parliament’s energy committee, told Iranian state television.

“They thought about this and used their experts and planned the explosion so both the central power and the emergency power cable would be damaged.”

The New York Times reported that the blast was caused by a bomb that was smuggled into the plant and then detonated remotely. The report cited an unnamed intelligence official, without specifying whether they were American or Israeli. The official also noted that the blast took out Natanz’s primary electrical system as well as its backup.

The Iranian foreign ministry accused Israel of an act of “nuclear terrorism” and vowed revenge.

Israel has neither confirmed nor denied involvement, but public radio reports said it was a sabotage operation by the Mossad spy agency, citing unnamed intelligence sources.

The New York Times, quoting unnamed US and Israeli intelligence officials, also said there had been “an Israeli role” in the attack.

Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman, Saeed Khatibzadeh, last week indirectly accused Israel of attempting to scuttle talks underway in Vienna aimed at reviving a landmark nuclear agreement.

The talks are focused on bringing the US back into the accord after former US president Donald Trump withdrew from it in 2018 and reimposed sanctions on Tehran, and to bring Iran back into compliance with key nuclear commitments it suspended in response to the sanctions.",618,3932,10,61

On January 14, 2021, López Obrador vowed to lead an international effort to combat what he considers censorship by social media companies that blocked or suspended the accounts of Former US President Donald Trump. © 2020 AP Photo/Marco Ugarte, File.

(Washington, DC) – Mexican Senate Majority Leader Ricardo Monreal’s proposed bill to regulate social media networks could severely restrict free speech in Mexico, Human Rights Watch said today. The bill would require companies to censor broadly defined categories of online content in violation of international norms currently in force. Senator Monreal should withdraw his proposal.

On February 8, just a few weeks after social media networks like Twitter and Facebook suspended the accounts of Former US President Donald Trump, Senator Monreal, who leads President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s party, Morena, in the Senate, published a draft bill on his website that would impose regulations on social media networks with users in Mexico. In January, President López Obrador had expressed his concern over the power of the networks to suspend Trump’s accounts.

“This bill would place the harshest restrictions on free speech that Mexico has seen in decades, opening the door to bans on social media networks and enabling the government to censor speech it disagrees with,” said José Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch. “Senator Monreal claims he wants to protect free speech in Mexico, but this bill would do exactly the opposite.”

The draft bill would make Mexico’s telecommunications and broadcasting regulator, the Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT), the final arbiter in disputes over content moderation, empowering it to overrule social media network operators’ decisions about how and when to delete a user’s content or suspend or cancel their account. And it would enable the IFT to punish social media network operators with fines of up to US $4.4 million if they fail to comply with its rules or if the IFT disagrees with their content moderation decisions. This could encourage further media concentration by forcing smaller companies to stop operating in Mexico altogether to avoid steep fines.

Under the bill, any social media network with one million or more users would need to obtain permission from the IFT to operate in Mexico. The IFT would be able to set rules about how social media networks operate and the types of content they can allow. And it would have the authority to review and change the networks’ terms of service, the rules that users must follow.

In effect, this would enable the IFT to prevent any social media network from operating in Mexico or prohibit users in Mexico from joining an “unauthorized” network, placing significant limits on freedom of expression. It could also encourage social media networks themselves to begin blocking users from Mexico to avoid the IFT review process.

The draft bill would also require social media networks to censor certain types of speech, such as “hate messages,” “fake news,” and any other type of speech the IFT deems should be censored to preserve “order and public interest.” The bill does not provide clear guidelines on what these terms mean, however, requiring social media network operators or the IFT to make determinations about whether statements are true or false. These requirements could lead to arbitrary censorship of legitimate content, enabling the government to force social media networks to censor content it disagrees with. This would be inconsistent with the prohibition on prior censorship in the American Convention on Human Rights.

Finally, the bill would prohibit social media networks from moderating the content on their platforms for reasons that the bill does not specifically mention, such as to prevent spam. This would restrict the ability of social media networks to make reasonable decisions about what kind of content they allow. Social media networks focused on specific groups, subjects, or interests, such as environmental issues or Indigenous culture, would be unable to operate.

Protecting free speech on the internet, ensuring that private entities do not interfere with that freedom, and giving people the ability to appeal restrictions on their speech are legitimate goals. But under international human rights law, Mexico has a responsibility to promote a “free, independent, and diverse communications environment,” and an obligation to ensure that any restriction on speech is necessary and proportionate to achieve a legitimate purpose. This includes regulation of speech through “indirect methods or means,” such as government controls over media companies.

Under international human rights standards, Mexico should not pass laws against so-called “fake news” or other “vague and ambiguous ideas,” or impose unnecessary or disproportionate restrictions on social media networks or online content. Instead it should promote media diversity and digital literacy. It should also incentivize companies to be transparent about their content moderation policies and to offer remedies for users whose accounts are suspended so that they can make their own choices about which platforms to use and how.

“Senator Monreal’s proposal is nothing more than censorship—pure and simple. It violates international legal standards by allowing the Mexican government to restrict access to certain websites and to decide what content social media users can and can’t share,” Vivanco said. “Imposing these kinds of heavy-handed regulations will stifle free speech, not protect it.”",892,5766,6,34

Ureña, a 30-year-old fulfillment associate, reportedly clocked out of his extended holiday hours, pushed open the Amazon warehouse doors, and immediately began wincing and coughing as his body adjusted to the toxic atmosphere of the future, with its piercing orange sky, scorching temperatures, and suffocating smog. Sources confirmed a stunned Ureña stopped dead in his tracks and stared blankly at a world filled with dilapidated, bombed-out buildings and plumes of toxic gas emerging from fissures dotted throughout the blighted hellscape.

“Hello? Does anyone know what year it is? I...I think there might have been some kind of mistake on my Christmas shift,” said an awe-struck Ureña, recoiling in fear as several Amazon-branded robotic guards, a cloaked man in a gas mask, and several teens on hover bikes zoomed by him, knocking him back. “Uh...I thought I was just going to spend the night picking up some extra hours at the fulfillment center. But I guess...something happened?”

“Hello? Hello? Is anyone there?” he added, swiping at the screen of his now non-functional cell phone, which showed thousands of missed calls and texts from friends and family. “Anybody? Please? Anybody?”

According to witnesses at the Plainfield Amazon warehouse, Ureña had reportedly put his head down to work in the year 2020 for a mandatory 10- hour bonus shift, and then was not permitted by his supervisors to eat, sleep, use the restroom, or communicate with his family, friends, or coworkers for the next three millennia. Per his timecard, Ureña had worked for over 26 million hours straight, throughout 15 violent revolutions, several nuclear wars, and countless near-human extinctions.

Over that time, sources confirmed Ureña sustained multiple back, hand, and eye injuries, which were not covered by the company’s health insurance, as he was just a contractor for those 3,000 years.

“Well, when this all started, I was just trying to do my job, but I guess none of that matters now,” said Ureña, who told reporters that his former house had been reduced to rubble, gangs of futuristic rebel fighters had taken over his neighborhood, and a crater now subsumed most of the United States. “All I wanted to do was go home and see my kids, but now everyone I know and love is long dead.”

“Why?” he added, dropping to his knees before the crumbling graves of his wife and children, surrounded by countless deceased family members he never got to meet. “Why?”

According to his supervisor at Amazon, however, Ureña reportedly did a less than satisfactory job during his extended hours, receiving three demerits for talking too much in the year 4021, nodding off on the job in 4044, and standing too close to a fellow employee in 5014. They also criticized Ureña for cutting his mandatory overtime shift short, saying he clocked out 7 minutes early and that his pay would be docked.

Asking to remain anonymous, several other Amazon employees also reported emerging from overtime shifts in the future, including a Whole Foods employee who was locked in a store freezer, only to be thawed centuries years later; as well as an Amazon delivery driver who fell asleep at the wheel, only to wake up in the year 7000 to his truck being thrashed by a large, tentacled monster.

“Honestly, I keep opening and closing my eyes, and hoping I’ll wake up from this dream,” said Ureña, going through his locker and throwing out all of his dusty, disintegrated possessions from the day his holiday shift started. “I at least thought I was going to get a promotion, title change, or maybe even just a little overtime bonus for my 40 lifetimes of work. Instead, they fired me for peeing in a bottle God knows how many thousands of years ago.”

0,Israeli Troops Shot and Killed a Palestinian Father. His Crime? Driving His Wife to a Clinic,https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/twilight-zone/.premium.MAGAZINE-idf-troops-shot-and-killed-a-palestinian-his-crime-driving-his-wife-to-a-clinic-1.9715059,"The main street of the West Bank village of Al-Jib, on the way to the adjacent village of Bir Naballah, north of Jerusalem. Monday, April 5, 2:45 A.M., the early morning watch. The Israel Defense Forces raided Al-Jib three times that night. The soldiers parked their heavy, armored vehicles on the narrow traffic island separating the two sides of the road.

Three weeks earlier, on March 13, they had wrested a young Palestinian named Ahmed Ghanayem from his bed at night and detained him. Now they were back again to search his house and his family’s store, which is around the corner from Ahmed’s house. Two soldiers stood next to some cars parked on the median strip across from the store. Suddenly an old Toyota approached from the east. A soldier signaled the driver with a flashlight to pull over. The driver at first didn’t notice the flashlight, but his wife quickly shouted at him to brake. The car came to a stop about four meters from the troops. A short conversation and the car was sent on its way. But then a moment later, the soldiers began spraying it with dozens of rounds of bullets.

“If a person falls from a plane in the middle of the night, / only God alone can lift him up,” the poet Dahlia Ravikovitch wrote. If a person is traveling in a car in the middle of the night in the West Bank, only God can apparently save him. Osama Mansour was killed; his wife, Somaya, survived.

The attractive Al Badawi World Liquidation Sale store, across the street, sells clothing, footwear, perfume and kitchen utensils at bargain prices. A sign in the store says, in Hebrew: “Up to 50 percent off on the whole collection for club members.”

The soldiers came here for the first time that evening around 9:30 P.M. A sizable force in vans, Hummers and other armored vehicles. They searched Ghanayem’s home. Children and teens pelted them with stones, the soldiers hurled back tear gas and left the village – only to return at midnight. Again stone throwing, again tear gas, soldiers conducted searches in a few homes. Eyewitnesses had the feeling that the troops were planning something.

The soldiers left at 1 A.M. and were back at 2:30. Two vehicles, a van and a jeep, stopped on the traffic island across from the store. Two more armored vehicles were parked a few dozen meters away. There may have been more. The street was quiet now, so late at night. Two soldiers stood on the same median strip that we stood on this week when we tried to reconstruct the events of that night, step by step, with the aid of the Ramallah-area field researcher of the Israeli human rights organization B’Tselem, Iyad Hadad. Two eyewitnesses, Azam Malkiya and Bassam Iskar, had observed what happened from their apartments, on either sides of the street, with the soldiers in the middle.

The Mansours’ 2010 Toyota approached, a soldier signaled the driver to stop with his flashlight, the car came to a complete halt. According to the witnesses, the driver also turned off the engine. Somaya and Osama Mansour come from the nearby village of Biddu, once a hub for Israeli shoppers on Saturdays but not since the separation barrier went up there about two decades ago.

Somaya and Osama told the soldiers that they were on the way home from a clinic in Bir Naballah, as Somaya hadn’t felt well. The family had been stricken by the coronavirus: Osama got over it easily; his mother, Jamila, was confined for 25 days in the Hugo Chavez Ophthalmic Hospital in the town of Turmus Ayya, which had been converted into a hospital for COVID-19 patients; and Somaya suffered from various symptoms and rested at home. The worst was over, but that night Somaya felt unwell again. The Mansours’ son Mohammed also fell ill, but the other children weren’t infected.

Osama was a vegetable merchant who made the rounds of nearby villages in his car. The day we visited their home, Monday, would have been his 36th birthday. Two months ago he was released from prison after serving an 18-month sentence: He had been caught in Jerusalem without an entry permit and was already serving a suspended sentence. Somaya, 35, works as a seamstress in Givat Ze’ev, a settlement just north of Jerusalem. The couple have five children and live in a small house with an asbestos roof in the yard of Osama’s parents’ house.

When we arrived, Bisan and Nisan, 10-year-old twins in school uniforms, had just returned home from school. They are now fatherless.

A photograph of Osama is propped up on the television screen. On the last evening of his life he asked his mother what he could buy for Ramadan, which began this week. There’s still time, she replied. One of the last photos of him was taken next to the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem; he had snuck in to pray; later on he was caught and arrested.

Somaya, the widow, enters the room, dressed in black, accompanied by the twins. She is tall and impressive, soft-spoken and tear-less, though her face is pained and pale. Osama returned from work at 11:30 P.M. on April 4, and hurried to take Somaya to the clinic in Bir Naballah. Somaya relates that he always looked after her like that, taking her to a doctor for every ailment. The doctor, she says, told her she had to rest at home. Osama then suggested that they should drive around a little, as she’d been cooped up in the house all day. She recalls that he bought her a sandwich at a grocery store that was open in the middle of the night. They didn’t notice anything unusual going on until they saw the soldier with the flashlight signaling them to pull over. The soldier aimed his rifle at them and shouted, “Why didn’t you stop?” “Why are you shouting at me?” Osama, who knew Hebrew, asked in reply. The soldier asked where they lived and where they were coming from, but didn’t ask to see ID cards or vehicle registration documents.

The soldier told them to be on their way, and Osama drove off. A moment later, however, Somaya says that she heard the sound of a single shot from behind; immediately afterward a few soldiers darted out in front of the car and riddled it with gunfire. Somaya describes “a rain of bullets” that landed on them. Terrified, she bent forward to protect herself. She felt shrapnel striking her back. “Are you all right?” Osama called to her, and she said, “I’ve been shot.”

The car veered from side to side; Somaya realized that Osama had lost control of the steering wheel. “Why are you driving like that?” she asked him – but there was no longer an answer. Osama fell over onto his wife’s lap, his head oozing blood. Somaya started shouting, but kept her wits about her. From the passenger seat, she grabbed hold of the steering wheel and also stepped on the gas pedal, in an attempt to escape the nightmare. A few hundred meters later she stopped the car with the handbrake and even shifted into park mode. The soldiers did not follow them. Four young men driving from the opposite direction stopped and quickly transferred Somaya and Osama to their car. He was still breathing, but had lost consciousness.

They took Osama to the Al-Carmel Clinic in Biddu, where staff summoned an ambulance that rushed the dying man to the Government Hospital in Ramallah. Somaya was treated for light wounds and the physicians told her Osama was being operated on. At 4 A.M. he was pronounced dead, but Somaya wasn’t told until two hours later.

The soldiers got to the car they had peppered with bullets 15 minutes after the incident, and took it away. They then proceeded to the stores and apartment buildings in the immediate area and dismantled the security cameras, including the one in the Ghanayem family’s store – it is not clear for what purpose. They also took the trouble to collect their shell casings from the street – the witnesses reported that about 50 rounds had been fired at the Mansours’ car. Hadad, from B’Tselem, found seven casings the soldiers had missed.

Osama’s body was transferred to the forensic medicine institute in Abu Dis, outside Jerusalem, where a postmortem was performed. Its findings haven’t yet been published, but as far as is known, only one bullet hit him, in the head.

The IDF lost no time in issuing an announcement stating that there had been a car-ramming attempt and that the vehicle had driven fast toward the soldiers and had endangered their lives.

This week we asked the army’s spokesperson’s office a number of questions: Does the IDF still maintain that there was a car-ramming attack? Have the soldiers involved been interrogated yet by the Military Police? And if they thought it was a car-ramming, why didn’t the troops rush after the vehicle in order to arrest the perpetrators? To all these questions the answer was: “In the wake of the event, a Military Police investigation was launched, and at its conclusion the findings will be forwarded to the office of the military advocate general.”

Salam Abu Eid, the head of the Biddu council, told Haaretz this week: “It was a crime not only against Osama but also against his wife and five children. The soldiers killed seven people, not only one person.”

Daisies planted by Osama adorn the yard of the house. His daughter Baylasan, 13, is sitting, dresed in black, her gaze bleak, along with the older brother, 15-year-old Mohammed. Baylasan (“elderberry” in Arabic) is a plant with white flowers from which myrrh and incense are extracted. One family member relates that today the plant can be found only across the barrier, on lands seized by Israel.

Ten-year-old Nisan rests her head on her mother’s lap, just as her father did in his last moments. Nisan covers her face with her cellphone, as though to distance herself from having to hear, over and over, what happened to her parents that night on which she lost her father – most likely for doing nothing wrong.",1784,10213,16,92
0,Iran says suspect behind Natanz plant attack identified,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/17/iran-says-suspect-behind-natanz-plant-attack-identified,"Iranian authorities name 43-year-old Reza Karimi as the perpetrator behind the nuclear plant attack, say he has fled the country.

Iran has said it identified a suspect in connection with a recent explosion and power outage at its main Natanz nuclear plant, as talks got under way in Austria’s capital to try to save the country’s nuclear deal with world powers.

State television said the 43-year-old man named Reza Karimi had fled Iran before last Sunday’s blast that it has blamed on archrival Israel.

It showed what it said was a photograph of the suspected perpetrator on a red card that had “Interpol Wanted” written on it.

“Necessary steps are underway for his arrest and return to the country through legal channels,” the report added.

Israel has not officially accepted responsibility for the attack but has imposed no censorship restrictions on its wide coverage by local media, some of which has explicitly said Israel’s spy agency Mossad was responsible.

The attack at Iran’s main nuclear facilities led to a large blackout and damaged an unknown number of centrifuges.

State television on Saturday also aired footage of rows of what it said were centrifuges that had replaced the ones damaged in the blast at the Natanz uranium enrichment plant.

The report added that “a large number” of centrifuges whose enrichment activity was disrupted by the explosion had been returned to normal service.

Meanwhile, officials from the remaining parties to the 2015 nuclear deal – Iran, China, Russia, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, together with the European Union – concluded a formal meeting in Vienna on a hopeful note, with different parties saying progress was being made.

Representatives from the United States, which unilaterally left the accord in 2018 and imposed sanctions on Iran, were again in a different hotel with Europeans shuttling back and forth between them and other representatives.

The agreement prevented Iran from stockpiling enough high-enriched uranium to be able to pursue a nuclear weapon if it chose in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.

After the talks, Iran’s top negotiator said a “new understanding” appears to be forming between all sides as the results of the job done by two working groups – one to determine what sanctions the US needs to lift, and one to determine what nuclear measures Iran needs to take – were reviewed.

“There is now a shared view of the end goal between all sides and the path that needs to be taken is a bit better known,” said Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s deputy foreign minister and a veteran negotiator.

“Although it won’t be an easy path. There are some serious differences that will need to be resolved,” he added.

Iran’s nuclear chief Ali Akbar Salehi said the country began production of 60 percent enriched uranium on Friday. Iran has said it wants to use it to produce molybdenum to ultimately manufacture radiopharmaceuticals.

Iran had previously boosted its uranium enrichment to 20 percent following the assassination of a top nuclear and military scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, in November. The nuclear deal caps the country’s enrichment at 3.67 percent. Enrichment of 90 percent is required for weapons-grade use.

Iran insists its nuclear programme is peaceful, though Western countries and the UN’s nuclear watchdog say Tehran had an organised military nuclear programme up until the end of 2003. An annual US intelligence report released on Tuesday maintained the longtime US assessment that Iran is not currently trying to build a nuclear bomb.",577,3555,8,55

WASHINGTON (AP) — The State Department on Saturday ordered non-essential diplomats at the U.S. Embassy in Chad to leave the African nation due to potential insurgent attacks on the capital.

In addition to non-essential embassy staff, the department also ordered the families of American personnel stationed there to leave because armed groups appear to be moving on the capital of N’Djamena.

“Armed non-governmental groups in northern Chad have moved south and appear to be heading toward N’Djamena,” the department said in a travel alert. “Due to their growing proximity to N’Djamena, and the possibility for violence in the city, non-essential U.S. government employees have been ordered to leave Chad by commercial airline.”

The department has long warned Americans not to travel to Chad because of unrest and the presence of the jihadist Boko Haram group. It said any Americans there now who wanted to leave should do so.

REUTERS/Tom Brenner

U.S. President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga will present a united front on Taiwan, China's most sensitive territorial issue, in a summit meeting on Friday, according to a senior U.S. administration official.

Biden and Suga are expected to agree on a joint statement on the Chinese-claimed but democratically ruled island at Biden's first in-person meeting with a foreign leader, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Biden and Suga will also discuss Beijing's treatment of Muslims in the Xinjiang region and its influence over Hong Kong, while announcing a $2 billion Japanese investment in 5G telecommunications to counter China's Huawei Technologies. (HWT.UL)

""You've seen a series of statements out of both the United States and Japan on the cross-strait circumstances on Taiwan, on our desire for the maintenance of peace and stability, on preserving the status quo, and I expect that you will see both a formal statement and consultations on these matters,"" the senior administration official told reporters.

The last time U.S and Japanese leaders referred to Taiwan in a joint statement was in 1969, when Japan's prime minister said maintenance of peace and security in the ""Taiwan area"" was important for its own security. That was before Tokyo normalized ties with Beijing.

The move now aims to ratchet up pressure on China. However, such a statement appears likely to fall short of what the United States has been hoping to see from Suga, who inherited a China policy that sought to balance security concerns with deep economic ties when he took over as premier last September.

In a statement after a March meeting of U.S.-Japan defense and foreign ministers, the two sides ""underscored the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait"" and shared ""serious concerns"" about human rights in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.

The U.S. official said the summit statement would follow on ""nicely"" from that, and that both countries, while not wanting to raise tensions or provoke China, sought to send a clear signal that Beijing's dispatch of warplanes into Taiwan's airspace was incompatible with peace and stability. read more

China's foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Friday that China has expressed solemn concern about what he called ""collusion"" between Japan and the United States, and the countries should take China's concerns seriously.

Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen told emissaries visiting at Biden's request on Thursday that the island would work with the United States to deter threats from Chinese military activities. read more

The visit was ""another concrete display showing the Taiwan-U.S. relationship really is rock solid"", Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said on Friday, after the delegation left.

China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control.

DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES

A Japanese foreign ministry official said this week it had not been decided whether there would be a joint statement, and two Japanese ruling party lawmakers familiar with the discussions said officials have been divided over whether Suga should endorse a strong statement on Taiwan.

The U.S. official said Washington expected ""each of our countries has slightly different perspectives"" and would not ""insist on Japan somehow signing on to every dimension of our approach.""

""We also recognize the deep economic and commercial ties between Japan and China and Prime Minister Suga wants to walk a careful course, and we respect that,"" he added.

With his first in-person summit with Suga and another planned with South Korea's leader in May, Biden is working to focus U.S. military and diplomatic resources to the Indo-Pacific and managing China’s rising global power, which Biden sees as the critical foreign policy issue of the era.

""The big issues that are playing out are playing out in the western Pacific, and Afghanistan was really receiving a disproportionate amount of time and focus and attention to the senior-most leadership,"" said the U.S. official, after Biden announced plans to withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan by Sept. 11.

UNITED QUAD

Biden hopes to energize joint efforts with Australia, India and Japan, known as the Quad, plus South Korea, to counter both China and a longtime foe, North Korea. Biden and Suga are expected to announce plans for the next Quad meeting on Friday, the official said.

Presenting a united front will require a delicate balancing act given Japan and South Korea's economic ties with China and the frosty relations between Seoul and Tokyo.

""It is concerning to us, even to the point of being painful, for us to see relations between Japan and South Korea fall to the current level,"" the U.S. official said.

""The political tensions are such that we believe it actually impedes all of our abilities to be effective in Northeast Asia, and I think the president will want to discuss this in some detail with Prime Minister Suga.""

Relations between Tokyo and Seoul have frayed over issues connected to Japan's 1910-45 colonization of Korea, including that of Korean women forced to work in Japanese wartime brothels.

The United States has cancelled the deployment of two warships to the Black Sea, Turkish diplomatic sources said on Wednesday, amid concerns over a Russian military build-up on Ukraine's borders.

Washington and NATO have been alarmed by the build-up near Ukraine and in Crimea, the peninsula that Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Last week, Turkey said Washington would send two warships to the Black Sea, in a decision Russia called an unfriendly provocation. read more

The U.S. Embassy in Ankara had notified Turkey's foreign ministry of the move, the sources said, but did not provide a reason. Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency later reported that no new notices had been conveyed to Ankara for potential deployments at later dates.

U.S. officials said that Turkey may have misunderstood the initial notification and the deployment was never confirmed.

They said the United States frequently notifies Turkey for potential access to the Black Sea. But a request does not necessarily mean its ships will pass through, but rather ensures that if they choose to, they already have the required approval.

Russia, which warned Washington to stay far away from Crimea and its Black Sea coast, says the build-up is a three-week snap military drill to test combat readiness in response to what it calls threatening behaviour from NATO. It has said the exercise is due to wrap up within two weeks. read more

Ahead of the notification about U.S. warships, Russia's navy on Wednesday began a drill in the Black Sea that rehearsed firing at surface and air targets. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called on Moscow on Tuesday to end its troop build-up.

1,Microsoft Has Revealed Master Chief’s Teeth And They Are Filthy,https://ogn.theonion.com/microsoft-has-revealed-master-chief-s-teeth-and-they-ar-1845185992,"In a jaw-dropping reveal at the Onion Gamer’s Expo that’s almost 20 years in the making, Microsoft just teased Halo Infinite by giving gamers their first-ever glimpse of Master Chief’s teeth, and let’s just say that these things are absolutely filthy!

Xbox fanboys, looks like your dreams of getting an up-close-and-personal look at the Chief are finally being fulfilled—and his dental hygiene is more upsetting than anyone could have ever predicted.



Ever since we stepped foot into the legendary Spartan’s MJOLNIR armor way back in 2001 with Halo: Combat Evolved, the single-player campaigns have always left us with the same tantalizing question: What was going on inside that helmet? Well, with this sneak peek at the yellowed, cavity-ridden teeth inside of Master Chief’s mouth, we’re finally getting an answer, albeit a viscerally disturbing one that none of us specifically requested.



Of course, there is a distinct satisfaction to looking over the Chief’s gingivitis-plagued gum line and impacted molars and realizing this is the Spartan who saved the human race from the Covenant. But as rewarding as it is for fans to finally take a gander at the pieces of decayed meat caught up in his bleeding gums and crooked teeth, all of this just raises more tantalizing questions: “Doesn’t Master Chief ever brush his teeth?”; “Has he considered braces for those repulsive things?”; and “Isn’t he bothered by his apparently severe halitosis while he’s cooped up inside that metal suit?”

At the very least, this answers how the hero known as John-117 managed to avoid seeing a dentist even once as he fought countless battles against the Flood, as well as giving gamers a great reminder of how important regular visits with their dental hygienists are. Plus, getting this close to the Chief’s mouth—no matter how repulsive—just makes us more excited than ever to get our hands on Halo: Infinite! Here’s hoping it’s worth the wait.



Until then, stay tuned to OGE for all the game reveals you could ever want.

0,Polish MoD Unveils Air Force Modernization Plan. Over USD 30 billion to be spent on Integrated Air and Missile Defence,https://www.defence24.com/polish-mod-unveils-air-force-modernization-plan-over-30-usd-billion-to-be-spent-on-integrated-air-and-missile-defence,"Parliamentary National Defence Commission assembled to discuss the information provided by the Minister of Defence, concerning the status of the Polish Air Force, its mission readiness, and the planned steps in modernization. A lot of concrete data was released during the debate, including the number of combat-capable F-16 jets, or delivery dates and HEAD operations start date associated with the Boeing 737s. The Polish MoD also outlined the amounts involved and timelines regarding the programmes that concern both the Air Force, as well as other branches of the military - including procurement of UAS and air defence systems.

The meeting began with a statement by the undersecretary at the Polish Ministry of Defence, Wojciech Skurkiewicz, who presented the information that the Polish MoD provided. As stated by Skurkiewicz, the Polish combat aviation component utilizes 48 F-16 aircraft spread among three squadrons. Another three squadrons: a single Su-22 unit, and two MiG-29 elements; are used solely in peacetime. MiG-29 jets are also deployed to conduct air policing missions, in the Baltics, and in Poland as well. In case of war, the Soviet-made aircraft would be virtually useless. Responding to the questions asked by the MPs, regarding the number of aircraft capable of undertaking operational activities, Skurkiewicz also provided definitive numbers. 41 out of 48 F-16s exhibit full combat capability - this is a number that is higher than the one we obtained last year (a bit over 30 airframes translating into around 60% of availability). The above means that the operational readiness of the Polish F-16 fleet now exceeds 80%. On one hand, this is a significantly high value, exceeding the analogous indicator in the USAF (around 70%).

On the other hand, though, readiness as such is a must, considering the limited overall number of aircraft remaining in the inventory of the Polish Air Force. Skurkiewicz also noted that 28 MiG-29s and 18 Su-22s are also being operated by the service, without any details referring to the availability. Responding to safety concerns raised by the MPs, when it comes to the Fulcrums, amidst the failures and crashes of the recent years, a statement was made by the Air Force Inspector, Div. Gen. Jacek Pszczoła. He said that the Bydgoszcz-based WZL facility has learned its painful lesson, and now it is trusted by both him and the pilots, with the safety levels being satisfactory.

Skurkiewicz announced that Harpia programme aimed at the acquisition of 32 F-35As along with a training and logistics package is currently underway. The acquisition itself is to have a price tag of around PLN 20 bn. If the infrastructure and armament-related investments are taken into the equation, the amount would be as high as 28.6 bn zlotys (7,5 USD billion).

Responding to a question asked by Maciej Lasek (KO MP), referring to the plans of withdrawal with regard to MiG-29 and Su-22, Skurkiewicz said that the Su-22 Fitters would be decommissioned in 2025, while the withdrawal process regarding the MiG-29 would progress gradually, along with the F-35 deliveries. MP Mroczek raised a concern that there is no plan in place, regarding the new structure of the Air Force. Responding to that, General Pszczoła said that by 2030 the Polish Air Force is to consist of five complete squadrons, 16 airframes in each squadron.

This, however, is not exhaustive. “In the back of my head, I believe that Harpia programme would result in the procurement of 4 squadrons, ultimately. It is not my place to say as to what type of aircraft would be procured next, but by 2035 another two squadrons would exist. Seven squadrons, 16 aircraft in each, by 2035”, Pszczoła said. Skurkiewicz also said that, depending on the finances, a decision to procure more combat aircraft after 2035 may be made. The official noted that the F-35 acquisition is a long-term investment, with the platform acting as a “domain integrator” boosting the capabilities of the Polish defence system. It is expected that they would be able to serve until the year 2070.

Skurkiewicz also outlined the status of the Polish airlift assets, with that component currently operating 59 aircraft, including 39 Bryzas (PZL Mielec M28), 16 C296Ms, 5 C-130 Hercules, 2 Gulfstream G550s, and a single Boeing 737-800. A procedure is underway, to procure five second-hand C-130H airframes, within the framework of EDA.

The MPs were also asking questions regarding the date of delivery of the two remaining Boeing airframes that have been already ordered. Pszczoła said that following the delays related to retrofitting of the aircraft in France, and delays resulting on the grounds of the pandemic, the aircraft in question will be arriving in Poland soon. The first one is expected to arrive in May, while the second - in June this year. Both are also expected to gain operational readiness in July. Pszczoła also announced that the sole Boeing aircraft delivered until today (“Józef Piłsudski”) would then leave for Toulouse on 21st June for retrofitting. The retrofitted airframe would come back to Warsaw in December. Representatives of the MoD also noted that three crews per aircraft have been trained to carry out VIP flights.

Within the context of the VIP aircraft, a dispute emerged regarding the procurement process of those. Czesław Mroczek indicated that an amount of 1.7 bn zlotys had been allocated to that acquisition earlier, while 3.05 bn. was the actual price paid for them, during the term of office of Macierewicz and Kownacki. Grabarczyk MP (KO) also pointed out that the acquisition was subjected to critique by the Supreme Chamber of Control. Bartosz Kownacki responded, stating that the Boeings, at the time of the acquisition, were the only aircraft meeting the Polish requirements defined for the VIP transport platforms. Kownacki said that the former government, allocating just PLN 1.7 bn. zlotys to the acquisition in question was unreasonable. Leasing of the Embraer airliners from Lot Polish Airlines was referred to, by Kownacki, as a waste. Kownacki added that no respectable government transports VIPs onboard aircraft that belong to the class of those leased by the Polish state. A similar opinion was voiced by MP Rozenek (SLD), stating that the matter shall be looked at in an objective manner. “The Polish state stopped using half-measures, and we are witnessing positive results. Critique directed against this procurement is not understandable to me”, he said.

The discussion was also quite intense when it came to helicopters. Skurkiewicz informed that the Polish military currently operates 238 rotary-wing aircraft, including 68 W-3, 22 SW-4, 58 Mi-2, 25 Mi-8, 19 Mi-17, 10 Mi-14, 4 SH-2H, 28 Mi-24, and 4 Black Hawks.

He also said that 4 ASW/SAR AW101 helicopters were procured. Black Hawks, meanwhile, are undergoing retrofitting to meet the requirements of the user, namely the SOF component. The process of retrofitting is expected to be finalized by the end of this year. 4 W-3 Sokół SAR platforms, meanwhile, are being upgraded to a common W-3WA SAR/FADEC standard. The first two aircraft would be handed off in July this year, with another two to follow in October 2022. Before that, similar upgrades had been implemented on 8 Sokół helicopters, it is expected that 20 would undergo similar upgrades. All of those would be received by the 1st and 2nd SAR (ASAR) Groups and the 33rd Airlift Base. Kondor naval helicopter procurement procedure and Kruk attack helicopter acquisition are in progress as well. As for now, the Technical Modernization Plan envisages allocation of an amount of PLN 16.2 bn. to the upgrades of the helicopter fleet.

During the meeting, another discussion took place referring to the resignation from the acquisition of the 50 Caracal helicopters.

Skurkiewicz also outlined the status of the training component in the Air Force. Currently, it comprises 52 aircraft: 28 PZL-130 Orlik (some of which are undergoing TC-II Advanced upgrades), eight M-346 Bielik AJTs (another four have arrived and are going through the handing-off procedure), 8 TS-11 Iskra trainers, 8 Bryza aircraft, and 33 SW-4 and Mi-2 helicopters, plus a simulator center at the 41st Training Aviation Base in Dęblin. Bryza, Mi-2, and SW-4 aircraft were all included in the previously quoted status reports regarding the airlift and helicopter assets. Implementation of a programme aimed at establishing infrastructure for the M-346 is underway now.

When it comes to the UAVs, the Minister mentioned the 12th Base in Mirosławiec operating 15 Mini Orbiter 2B elements. Procurement procedures are in progress, regarding the acquisition of the tactical short range UAVs (Orlik), 15 medium-range tactical Gryf UAVs, and four MALE UAVs (Zefir). Col. Waldemar Bogusławski, speaking on behalf of the Armament Inspectorate, added that two agreements are being drafted now, regarding the micro-UAVs and the Orlik programme. The mini-UAV procurement procedure is also being carried out now (Wizjer). Furthermore, the MoD also launched an acquisition programme regarding the Albatros naval UAV platforms.

The opposition MPs were indicating that the UAV procurement plans are insufficient, taking into account the recent experiences of the Armenia/Azerbaijan conflict and the global trends in the development of assets as such.

Information pertaining to the plans related to UAV procurement presented by the MoD (and the information regarding the air defence assets outlined below), most probably refers to the Air Force, and other branches of the military as well (Land Forces, receiving the Poprad SHORAD systems, or the Navy, expected to receive the Albatros systems).

Skurkiewicz also addressed the air defence assets issues. Currently, Wisła air/missile defence system, Narew SHORAD system, Pilica AAA/SAM system, Poprad VSHORAD system, Piorun MANPADS system, SONA AAA system, Noteć AAA system, Nida aerial counter-UAS system, Bystra radars, and Grzmot short-range missile system proceedings are underway in that domain. Together, the aforesaid tasks have a value of 122.6 bn. zlotys (over 32 USD billion), as defined within the Technical Modernization Plan.

Modernization of the radio-technical component’s inventory is also going on. NUR-31 and NUR-41 radars are bound to be replaced by new, domestically developed NUR-15M systems (15 examples). A project also has been launched to develop a domestic long-range radar (known as Warta - 17 radars to be acquired). Finally, the military also plans to procure 15 ATC radars, within the framework of a project named Drawa. To lower the level of the radar coverage in the East, four Aerostat-based radars would be acquired. The procurement programme is codenamed Barbara, when it comes to these assets.",1718,10795,20,118

Sadly, many young Jacksonville fans will die in boating or hunting accidents before reaching sexual maturity, but once they breed they can produce a dozen offspring, and most of those will go on to become adult Jaguars fans. So we still have hope this population will endure.” At press time, the survival of the young Jaguars fan was in question after the mother lost her job at Hobby Lobby and started talking about moving to Houston.

The advancing force includes 1,300 battle tanks, 3,700 drones, 1,300 artillery and mortar units and 380 multiple launch rocket systems, according to documents leaked to the Daily Mirror.

Tensions between the countries have been escalating following Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea territory in 2014, an attempt by Moscow to keep NATO away from its borders. Ukraine is not a member of NATO, but support for the organization has risen in recent years, and the country is allied with many NATO nations — including the U.S.

WHAT ARE THE IRAN NUCLEAR TALKS ABOUT?

Kiev has claimed 14,000 people have died in the ongoing conflict, and many fear that Russian President Vladimir Putin believes that the COVID-19 pandemic is the right time to attack and control large parts of the country, according to the report.

The appearance of painted stripes on Russian armored vehicles headed to the front lines reminded military experts of similar stripes on tanks used by the Soviet army during the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Mirror reports. The stripes are used as a deterrent to friendly fire.

The military exercise could also be seen as a challenge to the U.S., as President Biden is expected to impose sanctions against Russia for election interference, hacking and bounties on troops in Afghanistan.

The prime minister’s chancellery shared the data on social media: “Changes in the level of employment in general in EU states – data for the fourth quarter of 2020.”

In addition to Poland, Luxembourg also saw a 0.6-percentage-point growth in employment. The remaining member states, with the exception of the Netherlands, which maintained a stable employment rate, noted drops in employment growth mainly due to the pandemic crisis. The highest decreases were seen in Ireland and Spain with a loss of -2.5 percentage points.

Poland has recorded the highest growth in employment in the European Union in the last quarter of 2020 on a year-to-year basis, according to Eurostat data. In comparison with data for the last quarter of 2019, the index of employed persons in Poland increased by 0.8 percentage points.

It is important to note, however, that this data does not mean that the index of employed is the highest among EU states overall. This means, that Poland has seen the highest growth in the period which the data concerns, so 2020.

The index of employed people of working age in Poland is 69.2 percent, according to data for the fourth quarter of 2020. While this result is above the EU average (67.9 percent), there are countries in which this index is significantly higher: Holland (77.8 percent), Germany (76.3 percent) and Sweden (75.3 percent).

Eurostat pointed out, that the entire job market in the EU slightly improved in the last quarter of 2020 compared to the third quarter of the same year. The employment index among people aged 20-64 was 72.6 percent in the fourth quarter, which was a 0.3 percentage point increase compared to third quarter.

The number of working people in the EU dropped by 3.13 million in the entire EU in 2020. The decrease amounted to 2.67 million in the Eurozone itself.

Eurostat data also shows what has been known for quite a while – the pandemic has hit youth on the job market particularly harshly. Nevertheless, the scale of this issue may be shocking when compared to other countries.

In the period between the end of 2019 and the end of 2020, employment of people aged between 15-24 decreased by 208 thousand. This is the worst result in the EU. It is better even in much larger countries such as Germany or those struggling with issues on the job market, such as Spain. In these states, the decreases were much lower and were accordingly: 175 thousand for Germany and 198 thousand for Spain.",447,2659,27,149

I just hope the studio can focus on the good stuff, like the story arc where the two cops finally get their new roommate a job on the force and accidentally shoot an unarmed black man.” At press time, Criswell had revised his pitch to emphasize the diversity of the cast, and how many of the storylines actually focused on Black people and immigrants.

0,"There’s a Pandemic Sperm Shortage, and “Sperm King” Megadonors Are in High Demand",https://www.insidehook.com/daily_brief/news-opinion/pandemic-sperm-shortage-donors,"These may not seem like ideal times to bring new life into the world, but apparently not everyone sees it that way. In fact, despite the well documented difficulty of parenting during a pandemic, it would seem many aspiring parents have decided to move forward with their reproductive plans anyway. So many, in fact, that sperm banks can’t keep up.

According to The New York Times, sperm banks have seen a record-breaking increase in demand over the past several months. Maybe prospective parents think the flexibility of the work-from-home era makes it easier to carve out time for parenthood, or maybe, as Michelle Ottey, director of operations at Fairfax Cryobank, told the Times, “they’re just trying to find some hope right now.” But whatever the reason, people want pandemic babies, and the sperm banks are struggling to meet demand. While more people want sperm, fewer are donating it during the pandemic, and this supply shortage has left many prospective parents trying to get their sperm fix elsewhere — namely, the internet.

Enter the “sperm kings,” as the Times‘ Nellie Bowles has dubbed them. These are men donating their sperm, largely free of charge, through online networks. You can find them in massive Facebook groups like Sperm Donation USA, which boasts around 11,000 members and counting. According to Bowles, these groups have seen a recent surge in new members seeking sperm from these “off-brand megadonors.”

It’s easy to understand why these online communities are a big draw for aspiring parents. They want sperm, sperm banks don’t have enough to give, and these unregulated online alternatives offer a less expensive option with fewer hoops to jump through. But what’s in it for the sperm kings, many of whom receive little to no financial compensation for their goods and/or services?

For some, it might be a sex thing. While most donors reportedly specify they will donate through artificial insemination only, others offer donations via “natural insemination,” also known as sex. As one might imagine, “the line between altruism and a sexual kink can get murky quickly,” Bowles noted.

For most guys, however, the call to spread their seed seems to be more about the urge to reproduce without the burden of parenthood. “I have a strong desire to know my genes have been passed on,” one donor wrote on donor-finding app Just A Baby. “Like many of us, I’m not in a position to do so at the moment nor do I foresee this is in the near future.” While the idea of fathering myriad children might sound chaotic, some men seem attracted to the idea of siring a massive brood. “I have this vision of me being in my 50s and 60s, and I have a large dinner table, and I’m inviting all my donor kids to join me for dinner,” one popular donor told the Times.

Whatever the reason, however, the sperm kings know their reproductive material is a hot commodity, and many of these good semen Samaritans are content to give it away for free.

REUTERS/Issei Kato

Japan's inability to contain the COVID-19 pandemic means that plans to hold the Olympics in Tokyo should be reconsidered, health experts wrote in a commentary.

The 2020 Games, already delayed by one year, are due to begin in fewer than 100 days, even as Japan expands quasi-emergency measures to halt a fourth wave of infections. read more

Japan has exhibited ""poor performance"" in containing virus transmission, along with limited testing capacity and a slow vaccination rollout, according to the commentary published in the British Medical Journal on Wednesday.

""Plans to hold the Olympic and Paralympic games this summer must be reconsidered as a matter of urgency,"" wrote lead author Kazuki Shimizu of the London School of Economics.

""Holding Tokyo 2020 for domestic political and economic purposes--ignoring scientific and moral imperatives--is contradictory to Japan's commitment to global health and human security.""

The commentary adds to a drum beat of doubt among medical professionals that the Olympics can be carried out safely this summer. A survey of more than 1,000 Japanese doctors last month showed that 75% believed it was better to postpone the Games, according to physician referral company Ishinotomo.

Kyoto University professor Hiroshi Nishiura, an advisor to the government's pandemic response, urged in a magazine commentary this week that authorities postpone the Olympics one year to allow for more time to vaccinate the public.

Japan began its inoculation push in February, later than most major economies. Only 0.9% of the Japanese public have received their first shot so far, compared with 2.5% in South Korea, and 48% in the United Kingdom.

Olympic and government officials have said further postponement of the Games is out of the question.

Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said on Thursday the government would do ""everything possible"" to prevent further contagion ahead of the Games, after a ruling party official said cancelling the event remained an option. read more

About a dozen cases have been reported in recent days, with at least five evacuees staying in two homes and one shelter testing positive, exposing at least 20 people to the virus, said Dr. Simone Keizer-Beache, chief medical officer on the Caribbean island.

'HUGE' EXPLOSION ROCKS ST. VINCENT AS VOLCANO KEEPS ERUPTING

Keizer-Beache said officials are preparing to do massive testing as part of contact tracing, a complicated undertaking given that between 16,000 to 20,000 people were evacuated before La Soufriere’s explosive eruptions started on Friday. She also urged people to keep wearing masks and asked them to cooperate, noting that some who arrive at shelters do not want to be tested, which is voluntary.

""Let us work together to prevent a second catastrophe,"" she said in a press conference broadcast by local station NBC Radio.

Complicating efforts to fight COVID-19 is the lack of water in some communities given the heavy ashfall, with people walking or driving to spigots with buckets and jugs in hand as long lines formed.

Among those in line was Suzanne Thomas, a 46-year-old saleswoman from South Union, a community in eastern St. Vincent that has been hit with water shortages since Saturday. She had welcomed nine evacuees into her home who are huddled together, sleeping only on rugs and blankets.

""It’s real rough. We have to use one jug of water to shower, brush your teeth and flush the toilet,"" she said, laughing as she added: ""Water conservation.""

Others, like 17-year-old Kevin Sam, said they’ve had no water at all since Saturday: ""I’m glad that these stand pipes are available, ’cause I don’t know what we would’ve done. It’s not easy to bathe with half a bucket.""

Meanwhile, supplies were non-existent or running low at some government shelters.

Lisa May, 36, said she and her three children were sleeping on the floor at a shelter in the capital of Kingstown and hoped they would soon have at least one mattress to share: ""Any little help we get, we (would be) grateful.""

More than 4,000 people are staying in 89 government shelters. Meanwhile, the government so far has registered more than 6,000 evacuees in private homes, a number that keeps growing, said Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves.

He said he worries about an uptick in COVID-19 cases in certain areas given dwindling water supplies or complete lack of water.

""If we’re not careful, we’re going to have a spike, which could create a real danger in addition to what we’re having with the volcano,"" he said. ""Washing your hands when you don’t have a lot of water is problematic.""

Garth Saunders, director of St. Vincent’s utilities company, said crews are still cleaning intakes of the island’s water and sewer system and expected water to reach more communities later Thursday, adding that ashfall has been very heavy. Neighboring islands and organizations also have shipped water to St. Vincent, where officials have distributed water bottles and dispatched water trucks.

Long lines formed at those trucks and at money transfer companies, with some standing for hours to retrieve cash from loved ones.

0,8-year-old kidnapped French lady rescued in Switzerland,https://times24x7.com/2021/04/19/8-year-old-kidnapped-french-lady-rescued-in-switzerland-3155.html,"An eight-year-old girl was rescued in Switzerland on Sunday, five days after being kidnapped from her grandmother’s French home in a “military” style operation with the alleged involvement of her mother.

After a massive search, investigators found the girl, Mia, and her mother Lola Montemaggi in a squat inside an abandoned factory in the Swiss municipality of Sainte-Croix, French prosecutors said.

The 28-year-old mother was arrested along with five others accused of helping her.

Three of the men posed as child welfare officials — even using forged identifications — to convince Mia’s maternal grandmother to hand her over at their home in the village of Poulieres near France’s border with Switzerland on Tuesday.

No violence was used in the abduction, but the public prosecutor of Nancy, Francois Perain, said it was like a “military operation,” with the “extremely well-prepared” kidnappers even giving it a code name: “Operation Lima.”

They had walkie-talkies, camping gear, fake licence plates, and a budget of 3,000 euros to cover expenses, the prosecutor said.

The kidnappers were not known to police but were described as part of the same “community of ideas”.

“They are against the state and mobilised against what they call a health dictatorship,” the prosecutor said, adding that for them “children in care are unfairly taken from their parents”.

After the kidnapping, three of the men and her mother walked over the French-Swiss border, taking turns with the child.

Then a man nicknamed Romeo picked up Mia and her mother in a Porsche and drove them to a Swiss hotel.

They then spent a night with a woman who was a “sympathiser of the movement” before arriving in Sainte-Croix.

Five people linked to the kidnapping, aged 23 to 60, were arrested in France from Wednesday to Friday.

Mia is safe and in good health, and a psychologist and social worker would take care of her before she is handed back to her grandmother, the prosecutor said.

But with the story becoming big news in France, intense media pressure meant they would not immediately be reunited in Poulieres, investigators said.

The mother Lola Montemaggi did not resist arrest when Swiss investigators arrived at the abandoned factory in two vans, though Mia screamed, witnesses told an AFP photographer.

Montemaggi was taken into Swiss police custody and was expected to soon be the subject of a European arrest warrant for her extradition to France.

Nearly 200 police officers were mobilised in the search effort.

For her paternal grandparents, her rescue “is a huge relief”, they said through their lawyer.

“It is the end of nights of anguish and fear for the life of our little girl, in particular because of the extremist commitments of the kidnappers,” they added.",452,2767,7,55
1,A classic look at gentrification,https://local.theonion.com/sometimes-i-feel-like-im-the-only-one-trying-to-gentrif-1819584310,"Eli Kearney



When I moved into this neighborhood, I fell in love right away. Not with the actual neighborhood, but with its potential: It's affordable, there are nice row houses all around just waiting to be filled up by my friends, there's lot of open space to be exploited, and plenty of parking. Plus, this area has got a great authentic feel and, with a little work, it could be even more authentic. Perfect, right?

Advertisement

So why am I the only one doing anything about it?

I am always telling my other struggling artist, freelance graphic designer, and independent T-shirt-maker friends that this is the neighborhood to take it to. It's the next big thing. Sure, it's an hour from my day job and right next to a stinky canal and a power station, but that's the whole charm—it keeps the yuppies out.

It's frustrating, though. My friends insist they're happy where they are. But if they only saw the idealized neighborhood I see, where that rundown old health clinic is turned into a tattoo parlor, and that Last Supper mural is replaced with one featuring Radiohead or a stylized corporate octopus, they'd come around.

The problem is that the property owners here are clueless. They fill their yards with pavement and statues of the Virgin Mary, when all they have to do is clear that brush and we'd have a great beer garden or bocce court. They're spending all this money to renovate the old church, when it'd be put to better use split it up into condos. My landlord has no idea this apartment—hell, every apartment in this building—is undervalued. He could quadruple his profits by cutting my place in half. So I give him an extra 20 bucks a month hoping he gets the hint, but he just takes it out of the next month's rent.

Do any of these people appreciate what the neighborhood they're living in could be?

I'm trying to convince the owners of that taqueria on the corner to change their décor to incorporate some more of that funky Day Of The Dead motif I really like. But they insist on bland white walls. Ugh! I can barely pronounce the name, let alone enjoy its delicious, reasonably priced meals. Plus, you could take all the cool stuff from the five thrift stores and make one really great vintage shop. They'd make a fortune! And, you know, we would all have a fantastic view of downtown if only they'd tear down that dilapidated garage by the waterfront. Or, better yet, they could turn it into a restaurant with a roof deck. Can you say ""brunch on the harbor""?

I can't be the only one who'd like to see a community garden and dog run around here, can I?

It sure would help attract people like me if there was a record store, too, and not the one with the giant Shakira cutout in the window. I mean a decent one. I went in to see if they had the new Fiery Furnaces, and they had never heard of it. They said they'd see if they could order it for me, but I declined. I mean, what's the point of supporting a local business if it's not cool?

Advertisement

It feels like I'm the only one trying to do any good around here.

When I first moved in, I loved the 50-cent coffees—it was like living in the '80s—but I wish they'd listen to me and start making lattes. I know I'd pay the extra three bucks, and I'm sure everyone else around here would, too.

I've tried being proactive. But none of the locals I've talked to about bringing in a co-op health-food grocery store have seemed excited at all. Nor have I gotten any of them to take part in my community open-house idea for hip young people to come see what this neighborhood is capable of. What did they do instead? They had a barbecue. With very loud music.

I mean, I don't want the people here to leave. I just want them to stay inside more. Especially if they're not going to do anything to bring this community to life. But they're always out on their stoops, just playing dominoes or talking. I like talking, but I do it inside, where it was meant to be done. It makes me uncomfortable to have people watching me all the time. Not that I think they'd do anything, but I just like to be a little more private.

Advertisement

Also, their dogs stay outside and bark all day. I like dogs just fine, but why can't their dogs be smaller and more nervous?

It's getting to the point where I feel like I'm tilting at windmills. But I can't give up—I know this neighborhood would benefit from the diversity of more people like me moving in. If you need a good place to live, come check out my 'hood. It's quirky, but it could use a few more creative types to get it jumping. But no developers—those guys just ruin it for the rest of us.",856,4650,5,32
0,Hope for men with advanced prostate cancer after Australian treatment trials,https://www.sbs.com.au/news/hope-for-men-with-advanced-prostate-cancer-after-australian-treatment-trials,"Bernard Lefers is from Nouméa, the capital of New Caledonia, and has prostate cancer. About 1.3 million men are diagnosed with the disease worldwide each year.

He is currently doing well after taking part in a trial at St Vincent’s Hospital Sydney, which is using a new class of treatment.

“I'm feeling good, very good. I can do everything I want,"" the 61-year-old said. ""I can go swimming, go hunting and go fishing.""

“The treatment is not hard. Chemotherapy is very difficult, a very hard treatment. It makes you very tired.”

SBS Sandra Fulloon

Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in Australian men. Estimates suggest that 16,741 Australian men will be diagnosed this year.

Bernard was one of 56 men who took part in the LuPIN trial, which uses two new drugs in combination. His doctor and trial supervisor, Professor Louise Emmett, says Bernard had a very good response to the drugs, with a marked reduction in tumours.

LISTEN New campaign supports men as prostate cancer leaves many suffering in silence

“This trial is part of a series using a new group of drugs which is offering real hope for men with prostate cancer,” she said.

“When Bernard first presented to us, he was very short of breath, very symptomatic with late-stage prostate cancer. With each treatment, his symptoms progressively improved.”

Bernard is a retired police officer and was first diagnosed in August 2015. The cancer later spread to his bones and lungs. His treatment in Australia was subsidised by a French government organisation.

“Bernard had already failed at least two lines of chemotherapy and all other available treatments. So this was really the last option left available to him,” Professor Emmett said.

But when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Bernard was forced to stop the trial and go home to Nouméa. His tumours later returned.

After being granted a medical exemption, he has now been able to return to Sydney for ongoing medical treatment that is unavailable in New Caledonia.

""I am determined to continue. It's not the end for me, I want to fight, you know?"" he said.

How does the new treatment work?

The LuPIN research is gaining international attention. It combines two drugs - Lutetium PSMA and Veyonda.

Lutetium PSMA is injected intravenously to deliver a small amount of radioactivity to tumours without adversely affecting healthy cells.

In a recent trial by the Australian and New Zealand Urogenital and Prostate Cancer Trials Group (ANZUP), and published in science journal the Lancet, Lutetium PSMA was found to have improved treatment responses, quality of life and pain control when compared with chemotherapy for Australian men with end-stage prostate cancer.

SBS Sandra Fulloon

The second drug, Veyonda, was developed by Australian doctor Graham Kelly, who was also diagnosed with prostate cancer.

He has formed an Australian clinical-stage drug development company, Noxopharm, to focus on the treatment of cancer and septic shock.

“We believe that Veyonda works by enhancing the body's ability to fight cancer, and what we're talking about now is the immune system,” the 75-year-old said.

SBS Sandra Fulloon

The final results of the St Vincent’s LuPIN combination drug trial will be published later this year, citing a response rate of 61 per cent.

“We are delighted with the early results from this most recent study,” Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia CEO Jeff Dunn said.

“There's some exciting research work being done in this country, in fact, world-leading research work in the treatment of prostate cancer.

“For those men living with more advanced disease, it really is a game-changer.”

Supplied

Professor Emmett is campaigning to make Lutetium PSMA more widely available. At this time, a course costs $30,000.

Of the 56 men who started the trial, some have died. Bernard, and others, are still going strong.

“The last four years have been exceptional, very beautiful for me, and for my wife and all my family,” he said.

“Je voudrais merci. I would like to say thank you very much. Thank you very much.”

Police in Pakistan said a right-wing group has taken six security personnel hostage at its headquarters in Lahore on Sunday after a week of violent clashes following the arrest of the group’s leader.

Pakistan’s government banned Tehreek-e-Labbaik (TLP) Pakistan earlier this week after supporters took to the streets to protest against the arrest of their leader, Muslim scholar Saad Rizvi.

“Today in the early morning, miscreants attacked Nawankot Police Station where [paramilitary] Rangers and police officers were trapped inside the police station and [Deputy Superintendent] Nawankot [was] kidnapped,” read a statement from the provincial police in Punjab, of which Lahore is the capital.

The statement said the attackers were armed with petrol bombs and had stolen a tanker truck carrying 50,000 litres of petrol.

A senior police officer and two paramilitary staff were among the six being held by supporters of TLP, Lahore police spokesman Arif Rana told Reuters news agency.

Paramilitary soldiers stand guard on a road during a protest by supporters of the banned Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) group in Lahore, Pakistan April 18, 2021 [Reuters] Police said they have launched a security operation against the group in response to the attack.

Pakistani news channels have been barred from providing coverage of the group since it was banned, and on Sunday mobile and internet services were down in the area where clashes were taking place.

Addressing the media in the capital, Islamabad, Interior Minister Sheikh Rasheed said the situation in Lahore was “tense”, with an operation centring on the Yateem Khana intersection, about a kilometre (0.6 miles) from a TLP regional headquarters building.

Supporters of the TLP have been sharing videos on social media of what they said were clashes on Sunday with police, and hashtags supporting the group were trending in Pakistan on Sunday.

The videos, which Reuters could not independently verify, showed thousands of protesters clashing with police in riot gear, as clouds of tear gas hung in the air and the crackle of gunfire could be heard.

TLP spokesman Shafiq Amini told Reuters four supporters had been killed on Sunday and several others were wounded in the violence.

Continuing violence

At least four people have been killed, hundreds injured and thousands arrested in the days since Rizvi’s arrest.

The TLP leader had called on the government to honour what he said was a commitment it made in February to his party to expel the French envoy over the publication in France of depictions of Islam’s prophet.

The government said that it only committed to discussing the matter in Parliament.

Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday said the group had been banned because it “challenged the writ of the state”.

“Our government only took action action against TLP under our anti-terrorist law when they challenged the writ of the state and used street violence and attacking the public and law enforcers,” he posted on Twitter.

Let me make clear to people here & abroad: Our govt only took action against TLP under our anti-terrorist law when they challenged the writ of the state and used street violence & attacking the public & law enforcers. No one can be above the law and the Constitution. — Imran Khan (@ImranKhanPTI) April 17, 2021

Last week France advised its citizens to temporarily leave Pakistan.

Formed in 2017 by firebrand Muslim leader Khadim Hussain Rizvi, the TLP advocates for all those deemed to have committed blasphemy against Islam to be killed.

Since 1990, at least 78 people have been killed in mob violence and targeted attacks related to blasphemy accusations in Pakistan, according to an Al Jazeera tally.

The TLP has been banned under anti-terrorism legislation, with the government also initiating a process that would see it delisted as a political party by the country’s Election Commission.

France's top court has ruled that he will not go on trial because he was in a drug-induced psychosis.

Cannabis was found in Traoré's blood after he was taken into custody for the killing.

France's top court ruled on Wednesday that the killer of an elderly Jewish woman will not go on trial, France24 reported.

Kobili Traoré admitted to murdering his neighbor, Sarah Halimi, in 2017. He shouted ""Allahu Akbar,"" or ""God is great"" in Arabic, and ""I killed the devil,"" shortly before throwing her off the balcony of her third-floor Paris apartment, The New York Times said.

On Wednesday, the Court of Cassation — France's final court of appeal — affirmed two prior judgments that ruled that Traoré could not be held criminally responsible for his actions because he was in a state of drug-induced psychosis.

Traoré, a drug dealer, smoked pot every day for 13 years and had up to 15 joints a day, Israel Hayom reported. Toxicological analysis revealed the presence of cannabis in his blood on the day he was arrested, the French newspaper Libération said.

The court noted that ""a person is not criminally responsible if suffering, at the time of the event, from psychic or neuropsychic disturbance that has eliminated all discernment or control,"" The Times said.

Traoré will be held in mental health institutions until doctors deem him fit to return to society, according to reports.

In December 2019, President Emmanuel Macron made a rare intervention by criticizing the Paris appeals court for saying that Traore was unfit for trial.

""Even if, in the end, the judge decided that there was no criminal responsibility, there is a need for a trial,"" Macron said in 2020.

The country's top magistrates then criticized Macron for impacting the ""independence of the justice system,"" The Times of Israel reported.

The ruling has angered French politicians and France's Jewish community, the largest in Europe.

Dozens of French senators have reacted by proposing a revision to the law that exonerates a crime due to a drug-induced psychosis, The New York Times said.",386,2330,12,70

A drone dropped explosives near U.S. forces stationed at Erbil airport in northern Iraq late on Wednesday, Kurdish officials said, with no immediate reports of casualties.

A separate rocket attack killed a Turkish soldier at a military base nearby, the Turkish defence ministry said.

It was the first known attack carried out by an unmanned aerial drone against U.S. forces in Erbil, amid a steady stream of rocket attacks on bases hosting U.S. forces and the embassy in Baghdad that Washington blames on Iran-backed militias.

The interior ministry of the autonomous Kurdistan regional government, based in Erbil, said in a statement the drone was carrying TNT which it used to target the U.S. forces. It said no one was hurt in the attack.

A group that Western and some Iraqi officials say is aligned with Iran praised the attack, but did not explicitly claim it.

A barrage of rockets hit the same U.S.-led military base in the Erbil International Airport vicinity in February, killing a non-American contractor working with the U.S. military.

Shortly before Wednesday's attack in Erbil, at least two rockets landed on and near a base to the west of the city that hosts Turkish forces, Iraqi security officials said. That attack killed a Turkish soldier, Ankara said.

A rocket hit a base belonging to an Iraqi Shi'ite Muslim militia group near that Turkish base a few hours later, a security official said, wounding at least one fighter. It was not immediately clear who had fired the rocket.

Turkey also has troops in Iraq both as part of a NATO contingent and a force that has attacked Kurdish separatist militants in the north.

The Iran-backed militias oppose both the presence of the United States and Turkey and demand a full withdrawal of all foreign troops.

The United States has sometimes responded with air strikes against Iran-aligned militias including on the Iraqi-Syrian border.

An air strike ordered by former president Donald Trump that killed Iran's top commander Qassem Soleimani in January 2020 sent the region to the brink of a full-scale conflict.

1,Remember Me? I'm That Kid Who Had A Report Due On Space,https://www.theonion.com/remember-me-im-that-kid-who-had-a-report-due-on-space-1819584008,"That Kid Who Had A Report Due On Space



Hey there. Remember me? I'm that kid who had a report due on space. You probably don't recognize me because it was a long time ago. I used to wear my hair totally different. It was in this sort of Prince Valiant-style pageboy bowl cut. Hey, it was the mid-'80s, what can I say? Sometimes, I look at old pictures of me, with that hair, and I think to myself, ""You sure have come a long way since the days when you had that report due on space.""

Advertisement

You sure you don't remember me? That kid? Who had a report due? On space?

For a couple years afterwards, I'd get recognized pretty often. People would come up to me and be like, ""You look so familiar. Where do I know you from?"" And then I'd say, ""Encyclopedia Britannica. I'm that kid who had a report due on space,"" and they'd slap their foreheads and be all like, ""I knew I recognized you from somewhere! How'd that report turn out, anyway? Those encyclopedias help?"" I'd usually just play it kind of coy, giving 'em the old thumbs up and saying, ""Scored an A."" Sometimes, they'd even buy me a drink, but that doesn't happen much anymore. After all, that was 15 or 20 years ago now that I had that report due on space.

Not that I'm hung up on it. I've moved on since then. I don't want you to get the wrong idea and think I'm living in the past.

I guess after that whole report thing, a lot of people, myself included, figured I'd end up going into some line of work having to do with aeronautics or astrophysics or something that was at least somehow associated with space. But that's not what happened.

Oh, sure, I went to college. As a matter of fact, I included that report I had due on space in my application. So I guess those encyclopedias paid off in that respect. To be honest, though, I wasn't all that into school. I spent most of my college years partying. Oh, man, I remember this one kegger, me and my buddies had been doing Jell-O shots all night. And, well, to make a long story short, this totally hot girl comes up—she'd been checking me out all night—and she finally approaches me and is all like, ""Do I know you? Aren't you that kid who had a report due on space?"" I was sure I was going home with her, but she ended up passing out.

Sorry to go off on that tangent there. Long story short, I ended up dropping out of college after three semesters. It was too bad, because I had those encyclopedias, and they would've been a really good resource for reports on Napoleon or mitosis or the migratory patterns of birds or whatever. But, like I said, college just wasn't for me.

I ended up going to Alaska for a few years, to try to get my head together. I hardly brought anything with me, but for some reason, I packed those damn encyclopedias. They came in pretty handy during those long months working at the cannery. After a hard shift, when I just wanted to unwind and read something to cope with the horrible boredom and isolation, I'd flip open the encyclopedia. In the cold arctic night, it was a real comfort to read those things and be reminded of a time when life was simpler and seemed so full of promise—back when I was a fresh-faced young kid who had that report due on space.

After that, I kind of bummed around for a while, sort of directionless. I finally ended up in Boulder, working at this snowboard shop. By that point, hardly anybody remembered that I was that kid who had a report due on space. In fact, when I met my wife Robyn—or I should say ex-wife Robyn—she didn't even know about the report. To her, I was just that guy who worked at the snowboard shop with her brother Kurt. And I didn't mind. That whole report-due-on-space thing seemed long ago, and when we moved in together, I decided to close that whole chapter in my life by getting rid of the encyclopedias.

Advertisement

I know, I know. Maybe I should've kept them for sentimental value, but it was time to move on. I was looking forward to starting a new life with Robyn and the baby, and the last thing I needed was to remain mired in the past, thinking about that report I once had due on space.

It's too bad about Robyn. We gave it a go for a good five years or so, but it didn't work out. She ended up heading down to Arizona where her sisters live, and we're still friends—I mean, we keep in touch, but I don't know. Just wasn't meant to be, I suppose. She wanted to study to be a registered nurse. I offered to go find the guy in my building who I gave the encyclopedias to and see if I could get them back for her. You know, in case she ever had a report due on stethoscopes or taking people's blood pressure or something, but she said the class provided a textbook that had everything she needed. I miss her sometimes. But, hey, that's life, right?

Advertisement

Anyhow, I left Boulder shortly after that. The apartment was just too lonely, and since I didn't have the encyclopedias or the wife, I didn't need that much room anymore.

Sure is funny how life works out. I mean, if you'd asked me 15 or 20 years ago, back when I had that report due on space, what I was going to end up doing with my life, I never thought I'd wake up in my early 30s and find myself managing a U-Store-It facility in Tallahassee. But I can't complain. I've lived a pretty interesting life, even if it wasn't always what I expected. Besides, I'll always have my memories—and that report on space.",1023,5419,12,55
0,Mexico’s vow to tighten border fails to deter US-bound migrants,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/apr/14/on-mexicos-southern-border-its-business-as-usual-as-us-bound-migrants-trudge-north,"Groups of men, women and children stepped off small boats and on to Mexican soil without showing their documents to anyone.

Drivers quickly bundled them into taxis which sped past an immigration office to a nearby crossroad, where the travelers climbed into a vans for the next leg of their journey toward the US border.

Mexico has announced it is imposing new travel restrictions on its southern border, because of the coronavirus – its first such restrictions since the pandemic began. It has also deployed police, national guard members and immigration officers to its southern states to slow the flow of migrants from Central America.

This week the White House announced that Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala would deploy troops “to make crossing the borders more difficult” as the Biden administration enlists its southern neighbours in its attempts to slow migration.

But on a recent morning it looked like business as usual on this remote stretch of the Mexico-Guatemala border, which follows the mighty Usumacinta River. Packs of haggard people trod along a narrow highway through the Lacandón jungle, toting backpacks and water bottles and occasionally perching toddlers on their shoulders.

Police checkpoints dot the 150km stretch of Highway 307 from Frontera Corozal to Palenque – the site of impressive Mayan ruins. But migrants said they simply paid to pass through – or were robbed by the officers they met.

“They’ve taken our money and now we’re dead broke,” said Christian, 27, who was traveling with a group of Honduran construction workers. “And now we have to deal with the military. We need to figure out how we get north. We are always fighting and figuring out a way to get there.”

Shortly after taking office in 2018, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador declared that Mexico’s migration and customs forces were “rotten to the core” and pledged a clean-up.

But human rights activists say soldiers, police officers and immigration officials are still guilty of crimes against migrants, ranging from robbery to extortion and kidnap for ransom.

“It’s a cartel,” said Father Gabriel Romero, director of La 72, a shelter for migrants near the Guatemala border. “They’re acting in cahoots with smugglers… with taxi and bus drivers. It’s a network taking advantage of migrants.”

Mexico has once again become a stopgap in US efforts to slow migration. And migrants have become a bargaining chip in the bilateral relationship.

Analysts say Mexico’s deployment of security forces to the southern border is yet another example of the US government outsourcing immigration enforcement to its neighbour.

“We’ve turned into a very strong and very heavy control apparatus, largely due to pressure from the US government,” said Tonatiuh Guillén López, a Mexican academic and former immigration commissioner.

The number of migrants arriving at the US border dropped under previous enforcement efforts, including one that followed a high-profile increase of migrant children reaching the US border in 2014, and the deployment of the National Guard after Donald Trump threatened to impose crippling sanctions if migration wasn’t stopped.

But such crackdowns have never completely stopped the flow of people, instead forcing migrants to take riskier routes through remote regions and exposing them to a heightened risk of robbery, rape, abduction and death.

Guillén, who resigned as immigration commissioner in June 2019 after Mexico buckled under Trump’s threats, expressed doubts that the country’s enforcement efforts would work as effectively this time around. “The flow of migrants will continue moving, mostly because they’re in small groups ... and a significant part of it is controlled by human traffickers,” he said.

Human traffickers, he said, “have infrastructure, money and complicit relationships [with the authorities].” Additionally, “governments in Mexico, the United States and Central America have never really put much of an effort into controlling these trafficking organisations”.

After a call last week with US Vice-President Kamala Harris, López Obrador said: “We are willing to join forces in the fight against human trafficking and to protect human rights, especially of children.”

The two leaders also said they had agreed to work toward Central American development and “agreed on the urgency of carrying out emergency humanitarian aid programs”.

We made it here without eating. We’re drinking out of puddles Leticía, Honduran migrant

But whatever measures are agreed by the US and Mexican governments, they are unlikely to outweigh the many factors pushing Central Americans to feel their homes.

Migrants on the road through southern Mexico described escaping situations of abject poverty, hunger and violence. They described crops destroyed by drought and entire neighbourhoods devastated by hurricanes. They also spoke bitterly of politicians who oversee rampant corruption.

“Hurricane Eta swept away everything and left us in the street with our children,” said Leticia, 34, standing along the highway with her husband, Hector, and their three children aged 11, 12 and 14. “That’s why we decided to leave and search for a future.”

Johan Martínez, 34, said he had fled extortion payments in Honduras, despite lacking much of an income from his work as a welder. He pulled up his white singlet to show scars on his belly from being shot, and pointed to his front teeth. “Fake,” he said, explaining he had been hit with a pipe by angry gangsters seeking payment.

Like many of the migrants heading north, he seemed buoyed by the arrival of Biden, whose taking office he called “the opportunity of a lifetime”.

But getting out of Frontera Corozal was no easy task. Martínez and six fellow travellers paid taxi drivers 50 pesos for the privilege of walking through the town of 5,000 people – this after already paying to pass through migration checkpoints the length of Guatemala, he said. “It’s money, money, money,” he said.

The extent of human trafficking is easy to spot in Frontera Corozal, a scruffy tourist outpost populated by indigenous Chol families.

One local business owner, who preferred anonymity for security reasons, estimated that trafficking in migrants underpins 90% of the town’s economy.

He pointed to the crossroads, which was chockablock with migrants getting out of cabs and climbing into vans.

The vans paid 3,000 pesos to pass through various checkpoints, the business owner said. And when there’s a convoy of vans, “the checkpoints are only staffed so they can charge them,” he said.

The business owner sees migrants walking through the jungle around the perimeter of his property to avoid checkpoints. He provides them with food and water at a restaurant he operates and permits them to sleep in an abandoned vehicle.

But he serves smugglers, too. He broke from an interview to sell cans of beer to a pair of smugglers arriving in a new model car – part of a fleet of vehicles the smugglers used to discreetly move migrants, he said.

Migrants too poor to pay the smugglers end up walking – though they end up paying officials – who migrants say rifle through their backpacks and relieve them of their meagre belongings.

“The first thing they steal are cellular phones,” said Leticía, the Honduran migrant walking the highway with her family. She and her family had already been walking for two days in the sweltering heat and they were running out money.

“We made it here without eating. We’re drinking out of puddles.”

The sun was starting to set, and they still had 25km to go to reach the next migrant shelter. They turned north and started walking.",1269,7979,10,63
0,Aso repeats claim that treated Fukushima water is good to drink,https://japantoday.com/category/politics/aso-repeats-claim-that-treated-fukushima-water-is-good-to-drink,"Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso repeated his claim Friday that it is safe to drink treated radioactive water accumulating at the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant after China asked him to personally prove it.

""I'm sure that the water will be diluted so that (the tritium concentration) is one-seventh of the level safe for drinking water under the World Health Organization's guideline,"" Aso told a press conference, without responding directly to the proposal made by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian on Wednesday.

Zhao's remark at a news conference came a day after Tokyo officially decided to start releasing the treated water into the sea from the plant in northeastern Japan in two years. Aso said, ""I have heard that we will have no harm if we drink"" the treated water.

Aso refuted Zhao's criticism that the Pacific Ocean is not ""Japan's sewer,"" countering, ""So is it China's sewer? It's everyone's sea.""

Aso, a former prime minister who has doubled as finance minister since 2012, has often come under fire for gaffes and controversial statements.

According to the Japanese government's plan, the tritium will be diluted to less than 1,500 becquerels per liter, one-40th of the concentration permitted under Japanese safety standards and one-seventh of the WHO's guideline for drinking water.

In addition to China, South Korea and Taiwan have aired opposition to Japan's decision, arguing that the water will harm the marine environment, food safety and human health.

The government has relaxed the rule on mask-wearing outdoors in response to its successful mass vaccination drive, which has now seen 5.34 million people receive their first shot.

All in all, 61.7 per cent of Israel's 9.3 million citizens have now had a first dose of the vaccine, and 57.4 per cent are fully inoculated.

Newly-recorded COVID-19 cases and deaths in Israel continue to plummet, with just 14 new infections and no deaths recorded on April 17.

Vladimir Putin may have ordered up to half a million troops to the Ukrainian border as fears of war in Europe rise.

A veteran analyst today warned that the country is on the ""doorstep of war"" thanks to ""total mobilisation"" on a level not seen for nearly 50 years, at the height of the Cold War.

Russia is ready to go to war with the US if it intervenes, it is claimed - in spite of Joe Biden's call for calm.

Today Russian navy began drills in the Black Sea in a show of strength ahead of the arrival of two US warships in the region.

Videos released today seem to show heavy armaments on the move in Krasnodar region and naval vessels on the Don River.

Russia is known to be switching landing ships and other crafts from the Caspian Sea to the Black Sea for the first time since the end of the Soviet era.

Chilling new footage today also showed Russia’s Black Sea Fleet on manoeuvres - while Ukraine also conducted naval exercises off Crimea.

Yesterday Joe Biden called for a summit with Putin in a neutral country - but Russia has vowed decisive action if new Western sanctions follow.

This comes as a veteran independent Russian defence analyst Pavel Felgenhauer has claimed Putin may have ordered the movement of “more than half a million” troops involving forces from the Pacific to the Baltic.

Asked on Ekho Moscow radio if Russia was “on the doorstep of war”, he replied: “Practically, we are.”

He said: “An unprecedented mobilisation of the Russian armed forces is taking place.

“All the armed forces. This has not happened either since 1973, or since 1962. Total mobilisation. All armed forces .

“The exact number of people participating is not officially indicated. Apparently more than half a million.”

He stressed that the movements of troops take place during the day in order to show that Russia is ""fully mobilised"" and ""in full combat readiness"".

He said: “Because if we start something with Ukraine, the Americans said that they would support it, then we are ready to go to war with America at any moment.”

He claimed Russian was “preparing a deep operation for the total defeat of the Ukrainian Armed Forces by means of a strike, containment at the Donbass front itself and a powerful blow through Kharkiv from Voronezh, Bryansk, and Belgorod, cutting off and encircling the Ukrainian grouping in Donbass.

“And a counter strike from the Crimea. Plus a landing to ‘free’ Mykolaiv and Odessa from Ukraine.”

He stressed: “This does not mean that it will necessarily begin. But the preparation is serious.”

Such an attack would be possible between now and September, he forecast.

""In order for the West not to interfere and leave it to Ukraine to be devoured, we must show that we are ready for an all-out war.”

Felgenhauer alleged: ""Putin says that Russians and Ukrainians are one people, and should live in one state. Ein volk, ein Reich.

“And that the Ukrainian nation-state and the Ukrainian nation is a disgusting chimera invented by the Austro-Hungarians.”

(Image: REUTERS)

The current troop movements show “a fundamental difference from the routine of recent years”, he told independent Novaya Gazeta newspaper.

“The Russian defence ministry had begun an unprecedented general mobilisation throughout the country from Chukotka (close to Alaska) to Kaliningrad (between Poland and Lithuania) and the advance of troops to the borders of Ukraine under the pretext of a ‘combat readiness check’.”

Felgenhauer - who has worked as a defence analyst and expert for the Russian media for three decades - said: “All this looks as if the Russian General Staff is gathering forces and means for a possible ‘deep' strategic operation.

“A powerful tank wedge of the right flank, striking to the southwest through Kharkiv, cuts through weak Ukrainian defences, breaking through places where no-one has fought with anyone since 1943.

“Somewhere on the Left Bank, in the lower reaches of the Dnieper River, the oncoming southern wedge from the Crimea joins the northern one.

“ Powerful airborne assault forces bring an additional element of chaos to the Ukrainian command and control system.

“The main Russian-speaking cities of south and east (Ukraine) will be occupied in the course of a victorious and fleeting blitzkrieg.

“The rest of Ukraine will be denied access to the sea.

“As it was recently announced, the end of Ukraine as a state will come.""

Ukraine gained its independence in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union, but the two nations have had a hostile relationship for three decades.

Russia has been regularly accused of colluding with Ukrainian separatists in the east, and Ukrainian officials have frequently claimed Moscow is intent on splitting the country in half.

Large swathes of the Donbas conflict region in eastern Ukraine has a large population of Russian speakers, with a large proportion holding Russian passports.

Putin has vocally pledged to protect Russian citizens in other countries, offer a possible pretext to incursions into Ukraine.

In 2014 Russia annexed Crimea, a move that drew international condemnation and further demonstrated Putin's intention to expand his borders into former Soviet countries.

An estimated 14,000 people have died in the conflict

Russia said its naval exercises involved “a detachment of ships of the Black Sea Fleet"" conducting artillery firing as part of a combat readiness check.

This included frigate Admiral Makarov, small missile ships Graivoron and Vyshny Volochek, air-cushion missile ship Samum, minesweeper Ivan Golubets, as well as large landing ships.",984,6019,14,74
0,Loneliness and Depression: the Dark Path to Suicide,https://www.theteenmagazine.com/loneliness-and-depression-the-dark-path-to-suicide,"Before you read this article, I want to warn you that if you have any history of depression or loneliness, this may trigger you. It’s just mostly what I’m supposed to say but... take a breather. If you can’t take it, close your laptop, or exit your browser, do not make yourself uncomfortable. If you, however, dare to brave the article, Go grab some warm tea (no coffee) or nice chill OJ, breathe in and out and prepare for what is to come: Suicide.

Oh, did I say a bad word?

Should that even be a bad word in the first place?

Well, it depends on if you’re a victim of depression or a school administrative avoiding lawsuits. Here comes the triggering part: I don’t believe suicide is inherently bad. Before you come at me, suicide is not the great evil to fight, but rather a mirror of it-- a mirror of the pain that pushes someone to such extremes.

Now begs the question, “Is suicide worse than living a terrible and depressing life?” because no happy and fulfilled person ends their life. When someone commits suicide, you may begin to hate the person, to blame the person, or you may hate or blame yourself. “How didn’t I know?” “Did I ignore the signs?”

You probably did, but it’s not necessarily your fault.

Loneliness and depression are concepts I studied in the months following my suicide attempt—yes, MY attempt. It’s crazy, terrible, and hurtful. When you have no one to listen to or to lend an ear to your struggles, it breeds a feeling that there’s nothing to live for anymore. The pain of the present blinds you of any potential for the future. It isn’t your fault; it’s quite natural if I may say.

In the past, Social interaction was important for survival the same way staying out of a lion’s mouth was. But while our communities have evolved to make social interaction less vital for being alive, our bodies have not evolved to sense that it isn’t, so we have social pain (and this takes us back to a lot of sciency stuff that isn’t in the scope of this article). When this pain becomes chronic, it can be twice as deadly as obesity and just as deadly as smoking a cigarette a day. Yes, our priorities are a bit misplaced. The most dangerous thing about loneliness is when it becomes just that: Chronic. It becomes self-sustaining. You become more receptive to social communications and interaction and more sensitive to negative stimuli. You may begin to perceive the world or at least some part of it as if it is against you—When I was in this stage, I began to dream up fantasies, rather nightmares, of the whole world scheming against me— you avoid people for fear of rejection—this may come as sitting at the deserted back of the classroom or on an empty table at lunch or just simply ignoring calls—you feel unwanted, leaving conversations with genuinely interested people, you say no to parties and event invitations. This only leads people to view you negatively, “A snub! Isn't she?”

They exclude you from further things and truly begin to dislike you. Deeper and deeper you go Continuing the cycle that only works to plunge you deeper into loneliness and…

Repeat.

Now, Is suicide really a bad word? Or even a bad choice? Well, I can't answer that question for you; it's rhetorical. I can, however, suggest some things. For starters, we can and should end the stigma on the hidden Pandemic that bites through society: loneliness. We should teach about and talk about loneliness in schools and everywhere. Only then can we freely discuss our problems and eliminate loneliness. Only then, can we stop asking ourselves, “why didn’t I listen?”

The Last thing I have to say is, “reach out.” Do you have a friend you haven’t talked to in a while? Reach out. Say hi. Be awkward. Smile. If you’re vaccinated, have a sleepover or something. Make them laugh but don’t stalk them, and maybe, you can be the person who helps someone escape the vicious cycle that would push them to two options: Suicide or Lingering Unhappiness.",702,3954,8,51

“If we want a better system in terms of arms control, if we want to stabilize a lot of existing crises in the world today, we need an open and frank dialogue with Russia,” Macron said on CBS television’s “Face the Nation” program, according to excerpts made available in a tweet before the Sunday broadcast of the full interview.

“After unacceptable behavior, indeed we have to sanction,” Macron said. “We have to define clear red lines with Russia. This is the only way to be credible. I think that sanctions are not sufficient in themselves but sanctions are part of the package.”

Earlier Sunday, French Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to release Navalny, calling his fate a “major responsibility” for the Russian leader.

“Russia has to de-escalate, this is clear,” Macron said on Ukraine. “The situation today and the level of tension at the border is absolutely counterproductive and unacceptable.”

“We will never accept new military operations on Ukrainian soil,” he said. “We have to build the way to be credible vis-à-vis that.”

A senior Japanese ruling party official said on Thursday that cancelling this year’s Olympics in Tokyo remains an option if the coronavirus crisis becomes too dire.

The Tokyo Olympics Organising Committee responded with a statement saying all those involved in preparing for the Games remained fully focused on hosting them in the summer.

""If it seems impossible (to host the Olympics) any more, then we have to stop it, decisively,"" Toshihiro Nikai, secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party, said in comments to broadcaster TBS.

Cancellation is ""of course"" an option, he said, adding: ""If the Olympics were to spread infection, then what are the Olympics for?""

With Japan in the midst of a fourth wave of coronavirus infections, doubts over whether Tokyo would be able to host the Summer Games - already an unpopular idea with the public - have resurfaced in recent weeks.

Government and organising officials have consistently said the Games would go ahead.

""We do not speculate,"" an International Olympic Committee spokesperson said on Thursday. ""We are fully concentrated and committed to the successful delivery of the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 this year, and working at full speed towards the opening ceremony on July 23.""

But the fact that a ruling party heavyweight made the remark was enough to give his comments top billing on domestic news.

NIKAI EXPLANATION

""Olympics Cancelled"" was trending on Twitter in Japan with nearly 50,000 tweets from users as of Thursday afternoon.

""If this person says it, Olympics cancellation looks like a reality,"" tweeted @marumaru_clm in reference to Nikai, who is a key backer of Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and is known for his frank comments.

""Yay! This is great! Finally, it's cancelled, cancelled, cancelled!"" tweeted another user, @haruha3156.

Nikai later issued a written statement to explain his stance.

""I want the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics to succeed,"" the statement said. ""At the same time, to the question of whether we would host the (Games) no matter what, that is not the case. That's what I meant by my comments.""

Prime Minister Suga later side-stepped a reporter's question on whether cancelling was indeed an option, saying only that the government remained committed to controlling the pandemic ahead of the Olympics.

""There's no change to the government's stance, to do everything possible to prevent the spread of infections as we head towards the Olympics,"" he told reporters in Tokyo ahead of his trip to Washington to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden.

INFECTIONS SURGE

Japan is grappling with rising COVID-19 infections, with new cases in Tokyo jumping to 729 on Thursday, the most since early February.

Tokyo, Osaka and several other prefectures entered a quasi-state of emergency this month, asking bars and restaurants to shorten their hours, and four more prefectures were set to be added, local media reported.

Asked about Nikai's comments, the Tokyo Olympic organising committee said in a statement: ""Prime Minister Suga has repeatedly expressed the government's commitment to holding the Tokyo 2020 Games.

""All our delivery partners including the national government, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee, the IOC (International Olympic Committee) and the IPC (International Paralympic Committee) are fully focused on hosting the Games this summer.""

Preparations have included incorporating social distancing measures and other restrictions for the postponed Games, which are set to begin on July 23 and will be held without international spectators.

A scaled-back torch relay is already underway.

""We'll hold (the Games) in a way that's feasible,"" Taro Kono, a popular minister in charge of Japan's vaccination drive, said on a separate TV programme, according to Kyodo News. ""That may be without spectators,"" he added.

Japan's top medical adviser, Shigeru Omi, acknowledged the pandemic had entered a fourth wave, driven by mutant strains, with Kyoto University professor Hiroshi Nishiura urging in a magazine commentary that the Olympics be postponed.

Akira Koike, an opposition lawmaker with the Japanese Communist Party, reacted to Nikai's comments on Twitter saying that holding the event was already ""impossible"" and that a swift decision on cancellation should be made.

Cancelling or postponing the Games would probably not hurt Japan’s economy much but would have a larger effect on Tokyo’s service sector, a senior International Monetary Fund official said on Wednesday.

The social media company joins Facebook and other tech companies moving into Africa.

“Africa will define the future,” Twitter’s founder, Jack Dorsey, said in 2019 after a visit to Nigeria, Ghana, Ethiopia and South Africa.

Dorsey’s tweet announcing news of the hires on Monday said: “Twitter is now present on the continent.”

The jobs advertised in Ghana include positions for engineering, marketing and communications specialists.

“Today, in line with our growth strategy, we’re excited to announce that we are now actively building a team in Ghana,” the company said in a statement.

Twitter said its new team members would be working remotely under work-from-home policies while it explored “the opportunity to open an office in Ghana in the future”.

Ghana’s support for free speech and online freedoms made it the company’s choice for its first African location, Twitter said.

It added that the secretariat of the African Continental Free Trade Area base in the Ghanaian capital, Accra, had played a part in the decision.

Ghana’s President Nana Akufo-Addo said in a tweet that the country would be the location of Twitter’s headquarters on the continent, although this information was not included in the company’s statement.

“The choice of Ghana as HQ for Twitter’s Africa operations is EXCELLENT news,” Akufo-Addo said.

“This is the start of a beautiful partnership between Twitter and Ghana, which is critical for the development of Ghana’s hugely important tech sector.”

BEIJING (AP) — A top Chinese diplomat said Friday that U.S. policy toward China is “too negative” and that cooperation could be critically important as the Biden administration focuses on combatting COVID-19 and promoting economic recovery.

The U.S. appears to be highlighting confrontation and playing down cooperation, Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng said in a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press.

“Such an approach, I must say, is too negative,” he said, adding that it lacks “a forward-looking spirit.”

China could be a partner as Biden tackles the coronavirus and the economy, he said.

“To me it is hard to imagine the two priorities can be resolved without a cooperative and healthy China-U.S. relationship,” he said.

Le also signaled that China is unlikely to make any new pledges at a climate change meeting called by President Joe Biden for next week. He spoke as Biden’s climate envoy, John Kerry, was discussing the issue on the second day of closed-door meetings with Chinese counterparts in Shanghai.

Chinese President Xi Jinping announced last year that China would be carbon-neutral by 2060 and aim to reach a peak in its emissions by 2030.

“For a big country with 1.4 billion people, these goals are not easily delivered,” Le said. “Some countries are asking China to achieve the goals earlier. I am afraid this is not very realistic.”

Le said he had no details on the Kerry meetings in Shanghai.

Biden has invited 40 world leaders, including Xi, to an April 22-23 virtual climate summit. The U.S. and other countries are expected to announce more ambitious national targets for cutting emissions and pledge financial help for climate efforts by less wealthy nations.

Le said that China would convey a positive message at the meeting, but added that China is responding to climate change on its own initiative, not because others asked it to. On whether Xi would join the summit, Le said “the Chinese side is actively studying the matter.”

The U.S. and China are increasingly at odds over a range of issues, including human rights in Tibet and the Xinjiang region, a crackdown on protest and political freedom in Hong Kong, China’s assertion of its territorial claims to Taiwan and most of the South China Sea and accusations Beijing was slow to inform the world about the COVID-19 outbreak that became a devastating pandemic.

China hoped for an improvement in relations under Biden, who succeeded President Donald Trump in January, but the new administration has shown no sign of backing down on hardline policies toward China. The two sides traded sharp and unusually public barbs at the start of talks in Alaska last month.

Le said that after the opening of the Alaska talks, the dialogue was constructive and useful and that both sides are following up on the issues discussed.

The two countries could team up on coronavirus response, he said, but any cooperation must be on an equal basis, an apparent reference to the U.S. pressure on China on multiple fronts.

“It is not one side drawing up a laundry list of demands to the other side,” Le said. “In cooperation, one should not be selfish and care only about one’s own interests with no regard for the well-being of the other side.”

On the same day that a number of Hong Kong pro-democracy activists were sentenced , Le defended China’s crackdown on protest in the semi-autonomous territory. He described the convicted as rioters and said “they deserve what they got.”

He added, “I don’t think it is anything strange if Hong Kong somehow becomes more like a Chinese city because after all Hong Kong is part of China.”

The U.K., U.S. and others have accused Beijing of reneging on a commitment to run the former British colony under a so-called “one country, two systems” framework for 50 years after its 1997 handover to Chinese rule.

Le brushed aside such critiques, saying, “Hong Kong is always China’s Hong Kong and this is something that will not change.”

The vice minister also condemned Western sanctions against companies accused of human rights and labor abuses in Xinjiang. The U.S. blocked imports from several companies operating in the region last year, and added a blanket ban on Xinjiang’s cotton and tomato products in January.

Rather than protecting workers, Le said, “the sanctions have damaged human rights in Xinjiang, resulting in forced unemployment and forced poverty in Xinjiang.”

He also repeated warnings against American government contact with Taiwan, after Biden sent a delegation of former U.S. officials to meet the island’s president this week. China claims self-governing Taiwan as its territory and says, like Hong Kong, it should be under Beijing’s control.

“The U.S. should never try to play the Taiwan card,” Le said. “It is very dangerous. This is our red line. The U.S. should never try to cross it.”

American military officials have warned that China may be accelerating its timeframe for capturing control of Taiwan. Asked if China had a deadline, Le said only that it was a “historical process.”",943,5714,9,55
1,Nation’s Oppressed Christians Huddle Underground To Light Single Shriveled Christmas Shrub,https://www.theonion.com/nation-s-oppressed-christians-huddle-underground-to-lig-1819578481,"The gathered Christians listen to Trans-Siberian Orchestra’s “Carol Of The Bells” at low volume for fear that someone on the surface might hear.

UNDISCLOSED LOCATION—Persecuted and driven into hiding because of their beliefs, the nation’s oppressed Christians reportedly huddled in a secret underground bunker late Wednesday night to decorate and light a single withered Christmas shrub.

At great personal risk, the Christians were said to have smuggled in a few strings of colored mini lights, tinsel, popcorn garlands, Hallmark Keepsake ornaments, and other contraband in order to trim the shrub inside the subterranean chamber, the last place in America where they were safe to celebrate Christmas.

“We have come together today to observe a Christian holiday that has been all but stamped out on the surface,” said a man who wished to be identified only as “Greg,” after hanging a figurine of Mickey Mouse dressed as Santa Claus from one of the shrub’s boughs. “I can’t say this humble bush is much of a Christmas tree, but it was the largest we could manage to get here, given the circumstances. Let us remember, though, that to merely celebrate Christmas—to exchange gifts and eat our candy canes in peace—without the government or the powerful secular elite coming in and destroying it is a blessing in itself.”

“They want to bring an end to our holiest day,” he added, as several others erected a 3-foot-tall light-up Grinch and plastic signpost bearing the words “Santa Stop Here” behind him. “It is up to us to keep Christmas alive.”



After double-checking on the chamber’s entrance hatch to ensure it was tightly closed and locked, Greg then reportedly led the gathered Christians in hushed renditions of “God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen” and “A Holly Jolly Christmas” as the shrub was lit.

Those in attendance, many of whom had trekked hundreds or even thousands of miles, spoke of the great sacrifices they had made solely so that they could look upon an actual Christmas tree with their own eyes. A number of the Christians recounted how they had secretly carried a brightly painted plastic nativity scene and an inflatable 7-foot-tall snowman to the secret site, the latter item having been trafficked across three states in a truck with a false bottom. Others mentioned how they had sewed a few star- and wreath-shaped sugar cookies into the linings of their coats to avoid detection by the masses who sought to erase their holiday—and ultimately, their entire faith—from American life.

Reports confirmed that many who had arrived in the hidden underground sanctuary immediately broke down in tears upon being greeted with the forbidden words “Merry Christmas,” a phrase none had heard spoken openly in years for fear of harsh reprisals.

“It was difficult and dangerous to get here, but it’s all worth it to actually be able to celebrate the birth of Jesus,” said a 42-year-old teacher from Virginia who refused to give her name as she helped flock the shrub with a spray can of fake snow and arranged gifts of Yankee Candles and Amazon gift cards underneath its meager branches. “Unfortunately, this is the only way we can practice our beliefs now that corporations, the media, and our elected leaders have all conspired to remove every trace of Christmas from the country.”

“I just want to make sure my kids know what Christmas is really about,” she continued, adjusting the plush reindeer antlers atop her head and switching on her glowing Rudolph nose.

After the Christmas shrub was lit, the Christians were reportedly grateful to partake in other sacred traditions without fear of interference or abuse, such as the reading of the 2005 storybook classic The Elf On The Shelf and the viewing of grainy VHS copies of A Charlie Brown Christmas, The Santa Clause, and other beloved films that had been passed down through the generations.

Sources confirmed that as the evening drew to a close, all of their wrapping paper, Christmas cards, and fabric Santa hats were burned in trash cans to erase any evidence of the shunned celebration. The wary Christians then reportedly removed all incriminating green-and-red items from their persons and dispersed in small groups so as not to attract attention from federal authorities.

Germany's constitutional court in Karlsruhe earlier ruled that the Berlin state government had no right to impose the cap.

Coming into effect in February 2020, it saw rents for 90% of Berlin's apartments frozen for five years at their June 2019 level.

Renters are concerned that they now could be hit by sudden rent hikes.

Police estimated the crowd of protesters to have reached 'four figures'

Even the UN is 'quite concerned'

In an Interview with DW, Balakrishnan Rajagopal, UN's special rapporteur on the right to housing, warnend of the impact the court's decision could have.

""My main concern is that this particular ruling could affect the ability of the Berlin government, as well as the federal government, to ensure that housing remains affordable.""

He added, that there is ""general interest"" in ""the influence that Germany's record will have on other countries that are also facing similar crises of affordability in other large global cities like Berlin around the world, how it will affect their ability to control the problem of affordability.""

Protesters demand an end to 'rent madness'

Yesterday demonstrators first gathered at Hermannplatz in Neukoelln then marched to Kottbusser Tor in Kreuzberg, in the east of the city.

Many brought saucepan lids and drummed on them, a play on the German word ""Deckel"" (also the lid of a cooking pan or the cap of a bottle) used to describe the rent cap. Some shouted, ""If you take one lid from us, we'll come back with thousands.""

'We only want affordable apartments' this placard reads

Demonstrators demanded politicians clamp down on what they described as ""rent madness.""

Police put the number of participants in the rally organized by the Berlin Tenants' Association in the ""mid-four-digit range.""

Most protesters wore medical masks in compliance with coronavirus regulations.

Clashes with police

There were reports of scuffles between police and some protesters — part of a group of around 400 people who remained after the official end of the march.

Police reported isolated incidences of violence as they tried to disperse the protests

Some carried out isolated offenses against the police, a police spokesperson said.

The German newspaper Tagesspiegel reported that some protesters threw bottles and police made arrests.

Berlin's police said it would provide further information about events on Friday.

NEW DELHI (AP) — India’s two largest cities imposed stringent restrictions on movement and one planned to use hotels and banquet halls to treat coronavirus patients as new infections in the country shot past 200,000 Thursday amid a devastating surge that is straining a fragile health system.

The soaring cases and deaths come just months after India thought it had seen the worst of the pandemic — and have forced the country to delay exports of vaccines abroad. India is a major producer of COVID-19 shots, and its pivot to focus on domestic demand has weighed heavily on global efforts to end the pandemic.

New Delhi announced stay-at-home orders for the weekend, though essential workers will be able to move about if they have a pass from local authorities. Restaurants, malls, gyms and spas will be shut down. Movie theaters will close on weekends, but can operate on weekdays at a third of their capacity.

Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi’s top elected official, said that despite rise in infections, 5,000 hospital beds are still available in the capital and more capacity is being added. But still, more than a dozen hotels and wedding banquet halls were ordered to be converted into COVID-19 centers where doctors from nearby hospitals will treat the moderately ill.

“The surge is alarming,” said S.K. Sarin, a government health expert in New Delhi.

The moves in the capital came after similar measures were imposed in the worst-hit state of Maharashtra, home to financial capital, Mumbai. The bustle of India’s biggest city ebbed after authorities closed most industries, businesses and public places Wednesday night and put limits on the movement of people for 15 days. Train and plane travel was still allowed, however.

In recent days, the city has seen an exodus of panic-stricken day laborers, hauling backpacks and flocking to overcrowded trains.

Dozens of other towns and cities have also imposed nighttime curfews.

The surge in cases was weighing on hospitals in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and several other states, where many reported a shortage of oxygen tanks. Imran Sheikh, a resident of the city of Pune in Maharashtra, said he was asked to supply his own oxygen tank for a relative undergoing COVID-19 treatment.

Cremation and burial grounds in the worst-hit areas were finding it difficult to cope with the increasing number of bodies arriving for last rites, according to Indian media reports.

Shahid Jamil, a virologist, said the recent local and state elections with massive political rallies and a major Hindu festival during which hundreds of thousands of devotees bathed in the Ganges river were super-spreader events.

The 200,739 new infections recorded Thursday are about twice the number of daily cases that were recorded during the last peak, in September. The Health Ministry also reported 1,038 deaths from COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, pushing the toll over 173,000.

India’s toll of 14 million cases puts it second behind the United States. It ranks fourth in deaths after the U.S., Brazil and Mexico — though, with nearly 1.4 billion people, it has a much larger population than any of those countries. Experts say even these figures are likely an undercount .

As it struggles with the caseload, India is ramping up its vaccination drive. The Health Ministry said the total vaccinations crossed 114 million with more than 3 million doses administered on Wednesday.

When infections began plummeting in India in September, many concluded the worst had passed. Masks and social distancing were abandoned. When cases began rising again in February, authorities were left scrambling.",716,4433,11,60

While that emphasis on Japan's key status will be welcome in Tokyo, where some politicians are pushing for a tougher stance towards Beijing, it also raises questions about how far Tokyo can go to meet demands on regional defence and human rights.

""This will be the precursor to a series of meetings among like-minded countries to send the right signal to Beijing,"" Kunihiko Miyake, an adviser to Suga, told Reuters.

Suga took over as premier last September, inheriting a China policy that sought to balance security concerns with deep economic ties.

But striking that balance has become harder as China increases maritime activities in the East and South China Seas and near Taiwan, which Beijing considers a wayward province.

Rights concerns have deepened over the treatment of Muslim Uighurs in China's Xinjiang region. China denies abuses, but Washingtonsays Beijing is perpetrating a genocide.

Suga will be the first foreign leader to meet Biden in person since the president took office, something that could give Suga a boost ahead of a general election this year.

""Asking Suga to meet the president first means a lot - that China competition is critical and who is the best partner? Japan,"" said Toshihiro Nakayama of Japan's Keio University.

""That also means that Japan has to do more.""

Suga told reporters before leaving for Washington he hoped to strengthen the alliance based on the shared values of freedom, democracy, human rights and rule of law, show the two countries' leadership in creating a ""free and open Indo-Pacific"" and build a relationship of trust with Biden.

Besides regional security, the two are also expected to discuss climate change, supply chain resilience, a global semiconductor shortage and COVID-19.

Marc Knapper, the senior official for Japan and Korea at the U.S. State Department, said issues that would be ""front and centre"" in the discussions included ""China's unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the East China Sea, South China Sea; what's happening within China, and...around China, Taiwan, Hong Kong.""

He told an event at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies there would also be discussion of North Korea's nuclear missile program, which threatens both Japan and the United States, and ways to address ""existential issues of our time, climate change, clean energy, COVID-19.""

Japan is grappling with rising coronavirus infections with fewer than 100 days from the planned start of the Summer Olympics in Tokyo. read more

'PEACE AND STABILITY'

In a statement after a March meeting of U.S.-Japan defence and foreign ministers, the two sides ""underscored the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait"" and shared ""serious concerns"" about human rights in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.

The United States, the European Union, Britain and Canada have imposed sanctions on Chinese officials for alleged abuses in Xinjiang and some Japanese lawmakers think Tokyo should adopt its own law allowing it to do the same, while Japanese executives worry about a backlash.

Japanese officials were divided over whether Suga should endorse a strong statement on Taiwan, despite U.S. urging, or Xinjiang, two Japanese ruling party lawmakers familiar with the discussions said.

A Japanese foreign ministry official said it was not decided whether there would be a joint statement after the summit.

Asked to comment, a senior U.S. official said: ""We would not want Japan to make any statements that they do not fully support.""

Any comments by Suga on either Taiwan or human rights will be closely watched by China, which has warned Tokyo against ""being misled"" by countries biased against Beijing.

Taiwan is China's most sensitive territorial issue and a source of major friction with Washington, which is required by U.S. law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.

While Tokyo has no official diplomatic relations with Taipei, non-governmental engagement has flourished. Some Japanese lawmakers want even closer ties.

The last time U.S and Japanese leaders referred to Taiwan in a joint statement was in 1969, when Japan's prime minister said maintenance of peace and security in the ""Taiwan area"" was important for its own security. That was before Tokyo normalised ties with Beijing.

Japan hosts over 50,000 U.S. military personnel and, experts say, would be unlikely to stand idly by in any Taiwan crisis, although many ordinary citizens would probably be wary of entanglement.

WASHINGTON—Spurred by President Donald Trump’s own refusal to accept the results, a new report issued by the Pew Research Center Tuesday found that 70% of Republicans believe the U.S. election hasn’t happened yet. “It just doesn’t make sense—the major news networks are saying Joe Biden is the winner, but how can a winner be determined if no one’s had the chance to vote yet?” said respondent Neal Cooke, who echoed the concerns of the majority of conservatives surveyed in calling upon Fox News to retract their presidential election results while as many as 150 million votes remained uncounted. “Frankly, it’s way too early to call any states, considering Election Day hasn’t arrived. It’s not the mainstream media’s job to declare whether or not an election has occurred. That will be for the Supreme Court to decide. President Trump has every right not to concede an election that hasn’t even been held regardless of how happy we are of the gains we’ve made in the House.” At press time, a new report found 80% of Republicans refused to acknowledge Joe Biden was ever a presidential candidate at all.

osemarie Santiago was four months pregnant when she walked into prison. She left more than a year later as a mother who had spent just one day with her child.

She was taken to a Manila hospital to give birth to her son Jericho. The next day her siblings claimed him, and she returned to prison. She would not see him for another nine months.

“When I came back, he was so thin,” says Santiago, who was arrested in 2018 on drugs charges. “I kept thinking about what could have happened if I had not been arrested.”

Santiago is among hundreds of young mothers who give birth while in government custody in the Philippines, where the poor can wait up to a decade for a trial. Some women tend to their children in dismal conditions, even while handcuffed to their hospital beds. Others, like Santiago, surrender the child to family.

The most prominent recent case is that of activist Reina Mae Nasino, whose baby River died of pneumonia in October. The spectacle of the funeral, with a 23-year-old mother cuffed and unable to wipe her tears, was seen by critics of president Rodrigo Duterte as a jarring portrait of diminishing rights in the country. Duterte's expanding crackdown on drugs has sharply increased prison populations and left an estimated 25,000 people dead – drawing criticism from rights activists around the world. Nasino is charged with the possession of illegal weapons, which she denies.

The national Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) recorded more than 1,600 pregnant detainees and 485 births in the past two years. Around 80 per cent of the women face cases related to drugs, says medical officer Dr Paul Borlongan.

Drug-related charges against women jumped to more than 15,000 from 9,000 in 2015. Many are arrested alongside their partners and families, according to the Philippines’ Commission on Human Rights.

At least one other death of a detained activist's child was reported this year. Human rights advocates argue that babies have a higher chance of survival if they are not separated from their mothers. The World Health Organisation recommends breastfeeding for at least six months.

Rules in the jail management bureau manual cap a mother and baby’s time together at one month. Anything more must be approved by a court

But rules in the jail management bureau manual cap a mother and baby's time together at one month. Anything more must be approved by a court. Many facilities enforce separation after only a day, citing health concerns for the child.

The treatment of incarcerated mothers is largely “prison-specific, judge-specific, warden-specific”, says Inez Feria, director of NoBox Philippines, an organisation advocating drug policy reform. NoBox has supported calls to release mothers and other vulnerable people in order to decongest prisons.

At the Correctional Institution for Women, mothers can spend up to a year with their children. As the only national prison for women, it can set different rules from the one-month limit for newborns that applies in most other detention facilities.

When The Washington Post visited in February, three young women and their babies shared a space called the “mothers' ward”, across the hall from the cramped dorms of fellow inmates. The room had five beds (two mothers had recently checked out), a shared bathroom, a pantry and a shelf of toys.

Superintendent Virginia Mangawit says a separate facility would still be ideal. They are always in need of bed space. The prison, built for 1,500 inmates, holds more than 3,000.

Santiago, the former detainee, says she was not involved in drugs but pleaded guilty on the advice of authorities in order to avoid a longer wait for trial. By the time she walked free in 2019, Jericho's father had left.

BJMP spokesperson Xavier Solda defends the one-month cap for new mothers to be with their babies. “[It] is in the best interest of the child given the atmosphere, the health risks, on the part of the baby,” he says. “Are [critics] really saying that it's more okay to stay in a jail, given the conditions in our jails, rather than at home with a family?”

But human rights advocates say the Philippines is in violation of the “Bangkok rules”, guidelines from the United Nations on the treatment of women in detention. Under these requirements, determining the length of a mother and child's time together must be “made in the best interests of the child”.

The rules also say that cuffing mothers, even during the transfer to a hospital, “[violates] international standards”, and that every effort should be made to give pregnant women noncustodial sentences, among other recommendations on the facilities and health services that should be available.

In the Philippines, the Commission on Human Rights reports inconsistency in access to maternal health services. “None of the women mentioned availability of postnatal care or services for those experiencing postpartum depression,” it says. Only 37 out of 84 women's dormitories have a breastfeeding room.

Raymund Narag, prison reform advocate and assistant professor at Southern Illinois University, says the lack of physical and legal structures forces bureau employees in the Philippines to come up with individual solutions. Prison officers sometimes convert their offices to nursing spaces, or pool donations with the help of other detainees. At the national penitentiary, a prison employee adopted an inmate's child.

“Sometimes those coping mechanisms benefit [some] people but don't benefit others,” says Narag, a former detainee himself, who spent seven years in prison on murder charges of which he was eventually cleared. “You need new guidelines to deal with the concrete situation, not idealistic ones.”

Experts suggest that these gaps should be addressed through a new law, alongside formal guidelines from the country's Supreme Court and revisions to the jail management manual.

Officials told The Post that an interagency memorandum, which would streamline rules and probably extend the time allotted for mother and child, is under review. The health department hopes it will pass within the year. A Philippines senate bill, meant to aid incarcerated parents, has been pending at committee level since last year.

The issue can be personal for bureau employees. Hannah Nario-Lopez, a University of the Philippines assistant professor who conducts research and skills training in prisons, says some female guards expressed frustration at online vitriol received after the Nasino case.

“At the end of the day, all women suffer here,” she says. “[Anger at the] cruelty of the state, I think, should [be] directed to the critique of the system, lack of institutional support . . . rather than personal attacks on the officers.”

In one case last May, prison guard Sallie Tinapay – who was nursing her own 8-month-old at the time – was assigned to watch over a detainee after childbirth. When the inmate could not produce milk, she fed the baby from her own breast.

“It was like she didn't want to breastfeed,” Tinapay recalls. “She was thinking that they would be separated anyway.”

The mother, whom authorities did not identify for the sake of privacy, could not secure a court permit that would prolong her hospital stay. Social services picked up the infant, and a relative claimed her later, Tinapay says.

The inmate has been released, according to the prison’s management.

“I hoped she would be set free,” Tinapay says, “so she can take good care of her child.”

1,PC Culture Gone Too Far? Typing ‘Western Civilization’ Into The Chat Box In ‘The Sims’ Doesn’t Unlock Any Cheats,https://ogn.theonion.com/pc-culture-gone-too-far-typing-western-civilization-1844455342,"Anyone who follows the state of gaming knows there’s been a protracted attack on our industry over the past decade, one that threatens to erode all that we hold dear about video games and gamer culture in general. But it was not until today that we could say the onward march of political correctness has finally gone too far: Today, OGN has learned that typing “Western Civilization” into the chat box in 2000’s The Sims does not unlock a single cheat.

This is the thought police spitting in the face of our collective heritage.

That’s right, gamers: ancient Greece, Shakespeare, the Cathedral of Notre Dame—apparently none of that means anything to the social justice warriors over at Maxis. It used to be that we celebrated people like Isaac Newton or Thomas Aquinas, but apparently left-wing radicals are too dedicated to carping on about social justice to let the simple words “Western Civilization” unlock 100,000 simoleans. That’s the fallen world we live in today, brought to you by the cowards at EA.

There is nothing bigoted about celebrating all the wonders that Europeans have accomplished. But to spineless weakling Will Wright, everything associated with the accomplishments of an entire continent’s culture must automatically be thrown down the memory hole. That’s why typing “Western Civilization” into the chat box prompts zero rewards: no unlocked decor, no free satisfaction points. And that holds true no matter how many times you type in “Judeo-Christian Heritage” or “The Renaissance.” Apparently, facts are not politically correct anymore! Who knew?

Hey, but we’re willing to bet that typing in “Mohammad” unlocks every building lot in the game since that’s the only word leftist moral crusaders want you to be able to say these days!

Gamers, we must put an end to this plague of political correctness. Hitting the tilde key and typing “Western Civilization” into its console should be enough for a significant resource boost or access to God mode, at the very least. This is our history we are talking about. Stand up and let Maxis know you won’t let them denigrate you like this any longer!",352,2135,19,112
0,Facebook and fear in Manila: Maria Ressa’s fight for facts,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/18/facebook-and-fear-in-manila-maria-ressas-fight-for-facts,"As terrible as the events were that played out on Capitol Hill on 6 January, Maria Ressa admits to feeling “a small amount of relief” about them. An ex-CNN bureau chief, and now the founder of her own news organisation, Rappler, she had spent the past two years sounding a warning about what she’d seen happen in her native country, the Philippines.

There, a Facebook-fuelled tsunami of lies had assisted an authoritarian into power. And she had seen where that had led: to opponents of the state being killed in their homes or turning up dead in ditches. As a Filipino American with a foot in both countries – she calls herself “the first of the CNN hybrids” – she was perfectly positioned to warn America about what happens when a populist president is allowed to spread out-of-control lies across a vast, unregulated tech platform. “A lie told a million times becomes a fact,” she repeated again and again.

So how did it feel to watch the lies become an actual insurrection? “I mean, it was Silicon Valley’s sins coming home to roost.” But it also meant that there now might finally be action. “I know this working for CNN for as long as I did, right? Until it’s picked up in the west, it doesn’t get attention. At least now everyone’s motivated to fight.”

Ressa has had no choice: she has had to fight. Because she’s not observing the tech dystopia from afar: she’s living it. When President Rodrigo Duterte came to power in 2016, he declared journalists criminals – a message that was taken at face value when Ressa found herself under sustained assault. First on Facebook, then in the courts when she was accused of tax evasion in 2017, and then, in 2019, “cyberlibel” – a criminal offence that carries a penalty of up to six years in jail.

When I last saw Ressa, on a fleeting visit to London in February last year, she was having to decide whether to return to Manila or not. She’d come to see her lawyers. She has a team in Manila but she is now also represented by two high-profile human rights barristers in Britain, Amal Clooney and Caoilfhionn Gallagher. This is because while the case is being heard in the Philippines, Ressa has come to represent the increasing assault on journalism everywhere.

On the evening we met, she was struggling to decide. She knew that if she returned home, she risked being trapped and tried in a country where journalism had become a crime and the rule of law has all but collapsed. We met for dinner and I told her not to go back. “I think I have to,” she said. “I just have to.” Ressa routinely brushes off the gravity of her situation but even she seemed worried. She returned and was detained days later. In June last year, she was found guilty – convicted on the basis of an article she didn’t write, published before Duterte’s cyberlibel offence came into existence. She is facing a sentence of between six months and six years, though she is now appealing against it in the supreme court.

You’d never know this from a casual encounter, though. She beams in via Zoom from her apartment in Manila, shooing her visiting niece away from her screen, and she is as smiley and upbeat and warm and solicitous and welcoming as ever. We’ve crossed paths a number of times and whenever I see her, in whatever circumstances, she always radiates the same positive energy. Even now, with nine criminal cases outstanding and 10 arrest warrants, she’s almost ridiculously upbeat.

However, the situation in the Philippines is still ominous. Duterte continues to flout the rule of law. When I ask Ressa how things are, she tells me about the recent “Bloody Sunday” in which seven activists were killed in their homes after police came knocking at 5.30 in the morning. Her legal appeal is being heard in what Amnesty calls “a climate of impunity” which has seen at least 61 lawyers killed.

It’s because of Facebook that Ressa and I came into contact. For two years, she was almost constantly on the road, because for her, telling the world about the dangers of Facebook has also been about survival. She knows her best chance of protection is the attention of the world. And it’s why on 23 April, English PEN is bringing her to speak at the Bristol Festival of Ideas.

Almost the first words Ressa said to me were: “We have to talk about Brexit.” Because the election that brought Duterte to power took place just weeks before the EU referendum and, she said, foreshadowed it in striking ways, not least in the troubling role that Facebook played.

My years on air with CNN taught me to step back and tamp down your emotions Maria Ressa

The Philippines was, she says, “the first of the dominoes to fall”: the first election of 2016 in which Facebook helped facilitate a corruption of the democratic process.

For years, Ressa hopped between big news organisations: from being the head of news at the biggest broadcaster in the Philippines to a bureau chief and investigative reporter for CNN. But in 2012, she set up her own online news outlet, Rappler, a young upstart that deployed all the tricks of social media to engage its audience.

And in the summer of 2016, it was her team who carefully studied data and traffic and began to notice a network of fake accounts in the news landscape. At first, they didn’t understand what they were seeing. And then they realised: it was a massive, online propaganda operation being run by the Philippines state, fake accounts spreading fake news about fake incidents. “I saw the data as we gathered it in and I was like, oh my God, it was like seeing the heart of darkness.”

Her first thought was to tell the tech giant. “We had a good relationship with Facebook and so I showed it to them because we didn’t really understand it at first. But we realised that Facebook didn’t understand it either. And then by about September 2016, we realised that the people being attacked on Facebook were the ones who were questioning Duterte’s drug war. It was an information operation being run by the government.”

Bodies had begun to be found on the streets. A programme of systematic killings had started as part of Duterte’s war on drugs, which Ressa and her team realised was being mirrored online. Critics were being attacked on Facebook by coordinated, government-run accounts. There were zero degrees of separation between online violence and the real world. “And we still didn’t publish it. I went back to Facebook and there was radio silence. So eventually we published.”

What happened next was as predictable as it was devastating: it was Ressa who came under attack. She was swamped by an onslaught of online threats. “It was so intense. I just didn’t know what was happening.” When her younger staff started getting them too, she got security and counselling. “You have to. It screws with your head.” Her CNN training abruptly kicked in. “My heroes are Captain Kirk and Mr Spock and my years on air with CNN taught me to step back and tamp down your emotions so you can understand what’s going on. And then be ready with three bullet points.”

For Ressa, the answers lay in the data. It’s part of her process. She found swarms of government supporters flooding Facebook with #UnfollowRappler. And she could see the effect. How the fake accounts reduced their followers and throttled their traffic. She could quantify it.

Context is everything, but social media is breaking down context Maria Ressa

For almost a year, Ressa tried to lobby Facebook to action behind the scenes. In spring 2017, she was invited to lunch with Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook’s annual developers’ conference in San Jose. She explained to him how powerful his platform was in her country. Facebook’s “Free Basics” – the programme that allows mobile phone users to access Facebook (and the internet) for free – means that for many Filipinos, Facebook is the internet: 97% of Filipinos, she told Zuckerberg, are on it. “‘What happened to the other 3%?’ he said. And he was serious! He wasn’t joking!”

Eventually, she gave up asking nicely and started to speak out publicly. “Do you blame Facebook for what’s happened?” I texted her in February last year. “I do,” she texted back. “It’s the same messages that were seeded on Facebook in 2016, #ArrestMariaRessa – Maria is not a journalist, she’s a criminal … a lie told a million times becomes a fact.”

The seriousness of her situation has forced Ressa to action. In the time I’ve known her, the language she uses to describe herself has changed. She is still a journalist but she now also considers herself an activist, traditionally a dirty word in US journalism, which is dominated by the idea of “objectivity”.

“You know the phrase I always use is that when it’s a battle for facts, journalism is activism. But actually I went back over history, and journalism has always been activism. Our goal is to hold power to account. That’s always been part of the mission.

“And when I was at CNN, I would always say that objectivity is a myth. Because it depends on who you are. I replaced a guy who was six foot two, and he was white, Anglo-Saxon, protestant, male. So that’s very different. I’m a five foot two Filipino American.

“The line between journalism and activism, to me, shifted on 13 February, when I was arrested. They wanted me to feel their power. They wanted me to be afraid, whatever. Right? But I was just so angry.”

The first time she came out and called herself the a-word was at a journalism conference in the US.

“And you could hear a pin drop. Because these are my peers. These are people running news organisations. But this is how it has to be now. We have to call a spade a spade. Context is everything, but social media is breaking down context. And we have to bring meaning. That is our job.”

Ressa has always belonged in two worlds. Her father died when she was one and her mother left her in the Philippines while she went to the US and settled down with a new husband, before coming back for the kids. Aged 10, Ressa was air-dropped into a New Jersey suburb, barely speaking English. “I was the shortest and only brown kid in my class, four foot two surrounded by giants.” She was the outsider. And then the overachiever. She went to Princeton and then back to the Philippines on a Fulbright scholarship. She has always understood both worlds but not quite belonged to either, a role she has used to advantage in her journalism.

What I hadn’t realised until now is how Ressa’s experience of the internet has come full circle. It was as an investigative reporter for CNN that she began digging into al-Qaida’s use of social media, an assignment that gave her the idea for Rappler. “I was looking at how this virulent ideology spread, I could see how networks can be used for evil.

0,Russian prosecutors move to liquidate Navalny’s ‘extremist’ movement,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/16/russian-prosecutors-move-to-liquidate-navalnys-extremist-movement,"The Moscow prosecutor’s office has announced that it will seek to designate Alexei Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation and his regional political headquarters as “extremist groups”, moving to in effect liquidate the jailed opposition leader’s political organisation in Russia.

It is the most sweeping assault yet on supporters of Navalny, and comes after his two-and-a-half-year sentence on embezzlement charges and the arrest of his top aides on various charges following large protests in January and February.

In a statement released on Friday evening, the law enforcement body said it was seeking the designation usually reserved for violent organisations such as al-Qaida or Aum Shinrikyo, because it believed Navalny’s organisations were “creating conditions for changing the foundations of the constitutional order, including through the scenario of a ‘coloured revolution’”.

Coloured revolutions were pro-democracy uprisings in former Soviet republics in the mid-2000s now seen in Russia as western-backed coups. Navalny’s organisations have strongly criticised Vladimir Putin and his government, but have not called for any kind of armed rebellion to overthrow the Kremlin.

The decision, if approved, threatens to sever Navalny from his supporters in the regions and even from his financial donors, many of whom could be liable for financing an extremist group if they continued to provide support.

“They’ve decided to steamroll the Anti-Corruption Foundation and the headquarters,” wrote the head of the organisation, Ivan Zhdanov. “We won’t surrender.”

In a statement, he said: “The Kremlin has just demanded that anyone who does not agree with them to be called an extremist … It’s absolutely clear that the Kremlin’s new attack is connected with the planned protest and the elections in September.”

Leonid Volkov, another close Navalny ally, said the Friday evening press release was a “test of public opinion” and called Navalny supporters to make their voices heard.

The prosecutor’s office said that it had applied for a court ruling to recognise both organisations as extremist, which, if granted and upheld on appeal, would allow the government to fine and imprison members of the pro-Navalny groups.

On Friday, a former camera operator for Navalny was sentenced to two years in prison on extremism charges for writing two strongly worded tweets that said top Kremlin officials “didn’t deserve to live”. The tweets came after a regional journalist set herself on fire in an act of protest and died.

In the statement, the prosecutor’s office also claimed that Navalny’s organisation was acting in place of international bodies in Russia whose activities had been deemed “undesirable”. The statement in effect calls Navalny’s movement a front for western interests.

Navalny’s political movement has evolved over the last decade from a lone gadfly blogger on LiveJournal to a guerrilla newsroom, an opposition research centre and a campaign strategy headquarters seeking to unseat the United Russia party by channelling votes to its most likely opponents.

The Anti-Corruption Foundation has angered Russia’s elites by publishing investigations into their expensive watches, yachting trips, lovers’ trysts, inflated procurements and other aspects of government corruption that Navalny says has characterised the Putin era.

On Friday, it published its latest investigation into a lavish residence allegedly used by Putin, which is reportedly fitted out with a luxury spa complex with cryo chambers and a float pool, and which it claimed was rented from a close ally of Putin’s using taxpayers’ money.

The continuing investigations have proven that Navalny can be dangerous to the Kremlin even while he remains on hunger strike in a Russian prison. He was arrested upon returning to the country in January following treatment for a poisoning attempt on his life that he, in a joint investigation with Bellingcat, traced back to the Russian FSB.",606,3971,8,68

Enlarge this image toggle caption Andre Penner/AP Andre Penner/AP

Health officials in Brazil say many hospitals are running dangerously short of sedatives and other crucial medications used for treating gravely ill COVID-19 patients.

They say some health services have already exhausted stocks of certain drugs, while others expect to do so within the next few days unless they receive fresh supplies.

The warning comes amid intense international concern over the spiraling pandemic in Brazil, where the average daily death toll has risen above 3,000, the highest in the world. To date, 365,444 people in the country have died of COVID-19, according to Brazil's health ministry.

Brazil's health crisis is being described as a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" by the international medical aid agency Doctors Without Borders (known by its French acronym, MSF), which has teams in parts of the country.

""The Brazilian authorities' ... refusal to adopt evidence-based public health measures has sent far too many to an early grave,"" MSF's international president Dr. Christos Christou said in a statement on Wednesday.

He said this has put Brazil in ""a permanent state of mourning"" and has caused ""the near collapse of Brazil's health system.""

The alarm over the lack of medicines is being raised, in particular, by the country's richest and most populous state, São Paulo, which has so far registered almost one in four of Brazil's total COVID-19 deaths.

São Paulo's state government says its health services are facing ""very serious"" shortages, notably of muscle relaxants and sedatives needed for patients on respirators in intensive care units.

In a letter sent Tuesday to Brazil's Health Ministry, the state issued an urgent appeal for fresh supplies and accused the ministry of ignoring nine recent requests.

The scale of the problem has been underscored by a survey conducted by an organization representing local health officials: This found that more than two thirds of the 3,126 municipal health services in São Paulo were completely out of muscle relaxants, while 961 had no sedatives.

Front-line medical staff are reportedly turning to less effective alternative drugs, yet there have also been Brazilian media accounts of patients being tied by their arms to their beds to prevent them reacting violently to intubation when they wake up.

One of the country's leading news organizations, Folha de S. Paulo, recently published photographs and video of patients on respirators with their arms tied to the sides of their beds in a hospital in the northwestern city of Porto Velho.

Medicine shortages are adding to the already intense pressure on the country's intensive care units, where often exhausted and depleted staff are struggling to cope with a second wave of the pandemic, propelled by new variants of the virus. In parts of the country, patients have died while waiting for ICU beds to become available, according to medical staff and victims' families.

Overall occupancy rates for ICU beds have dropped slightly recently but remain critical in most of Brazil, according to a bulletin issued Wednesday by Fiocruz, a national health research institution. It said 16 of Brazil's 26 states have ICU bed occupancy levels of 90% or above. In São Paulo, it was 86%.

Brazil's Health Ministry has reportedly had significant problems buying anything close to sufficient quantities of medicines to cope with the surge in intensive care patients. It said Thursday that a large consignment of medicines donated by businesses was to be flown into the country in the coming hours, including sedatives, muscle relaxants and other drugs.

São Paulo has long been highly critical of the response to the pandemic by President Jair Bolsonaro, who has had four health ministers since the first coronavirus case was reported in Brazil early last year.

The state is far from alone.

Bolsonaro is facing ferocious criticism at home and abroad for scoffing at the threat of the virus, undermining social distancing and isolation measures, advocating unproven remedies, bungling the national vaccination program and discouraging people from being vaccinated.

The far-right president's position has become still more uncomfortable following a decision by Brazil's Supreme Court on Wednesday to give the go-ahead to a Senate inquiry into his government's handling of the pandemic.

Bolsonaro has argued throughout that lockdowns and other pandemic restrictions inflict more economic and social misery than the virus itself. He fell back on that defense again Wednesday, with a vaguely worded warning that there will soon be ""enormous crises"" in Brazil.

""I am not threatening anyone, but Brazil is at the limit,"" he told supporters, adding mysteriously: ""I am waiting for the people to give a signal because the hunger, misery and unemployment is there.""",776,4927,11,72

Pentagon scientists have invented a microchip that once inserted under the skin will detect if the patient develops Covid-19.

And they have also developed a revolutionary filter that can remove the virus from the patient’s blood through a dialysis machine.

Researchers at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) say they have been working for years on ways to prevent and to end pandemics.

Their work on the microchip was revealed on 60 Minutes on CBS on Sunday night.

Retired Colonel Matt Hepburn, an army infectious disease physician leading DARPA’s response to the pandemic, showed off the technology on the show.

The idea for the invention came after 1,271 infections were recorded on board the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier in 2020.

The microchip, which does not track movements, is carried in a tissue-like gel and is designed to continuously test the patient’s blood.

“You put it underneath your skin and what that tells you is that there are chemical reactions going on inside the body, and that signal means you are going to have symptoms tomorrow,” explained Col Hepburn.

And he added: “It’s like a ‘check engine’ light.

“Sailors would get the signal, then self-administer a blood draw and test themselves on site.

“We can have that information in three to five minutes. As you truncate that time, as you diagnose and treat, what you do is you stop the infection in its tracks.”

Col Hepburn also told the show that his team had invented a filter that if placed on a dialysis machine would remove the virus from blood.

He said that the four-day treatment had been given to “Patient 16”, the spouse of a military member, who was in organ failure and septic shock.

“You pass it through, and it takes the virus out, and puts the blood back in,” said Col Hepburn.

And he said that within days of the treatment the patient had made a full recovery.

The treatment has now been approved by the FDA for emergency use and has been used to treat almost 300 sick patients.

The body was originally known as the Advanced Research Projects Agency and was created in 1958 by president Dwight Eisenhower in response to the Russian launch of Sputnik the year before.

Eight countries, including the US, Iceland and Malta, are expected to be included on the list.

“Israel must be the next most likely. Again, it has vaccinated close to its entire population and case numbers are below even last year’s threshold.” “The surest case for green must be Gibraltar.

GDP growth of 18.3% year-on-year in the first quarter was the strongest since China began keeping records in 1992, and was driven by a surge in retail sales, industrial production and investment in fixed assets.

The big jump reflects the deep slump in activity in early 2020 but it keeps China on track for growth of between 8% and 9% in 2021, economists said, far ahead of the Chinese government's official target of more than 6%.

""We are fully confident that we can maintain the current recovery momentum throughout the year,"" said Liu Aihua, a spokeswoman for the National Bureau of Statistics at a press conference in Beijing on Friday.

First quarter retail sales jumped 34% from a year ago, while fixed-asset investment in urban areas gained nearly 26%. Industrial production increased by more than 24%.

“After a period of reflection, I’ve made the decision to step back from active participation on our Broadway productions, effective immediately. My roles will be filled by others from the Broadway community and in a number of cases, from the roster of participants already in place on those shows,"" Rudin said in a statement.

The move comes more than a week after The Hollywood Reporter’s cover story on Rudin contained accounts of the producing heavyweight throwing glass bowls, staples and baked potatoes at former employees. In his statement Saturday he did not deny the allegations.

“Much has been written about my history of troubling interactions with colleagues, and I am profoundly sorry for the pain my behavior caused to individuals, directly and indirectly. I am now taking steps that I should have taken years ago to address this behavior,” he said.

The revelations in The Hollywood Reporter also prompted the performers’ unions SAG-AFTRA Actors Equity and the American Federation of Musicians Local 802 to come together condemn illegal harassment and harassment that creates a toxic work environment for entertainment employees.

The revelations also prompted Tony Award-winner Karen Olivo to pull out of returning to “Moulin Rouge! The Musical” once it reopens. There are also plans for a protest March on Broadway on Wednesday, with stops at both Rudin’s office as well as the Winter Garden Theatre, where Rudin is producing the Broadway revival of “The Music Man."" There's also a campaign to persuade Actors’ Equity Association to add Rudin to a Do Not Work list.

In his statement, Rudin mentioned the upcoming reopening of Broadway after the pandemic shuttered theaters for more than a year. He said he did not want to “interrupt” the work ahead.

0,Still no proof that Russia paid Taliban bounties for dead Americans,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/remember-those-russian-bounties-dead-u-s-troops-biden-admin-n1264215,"WASHINGTON — While he was campaigning for president, Joe Biden treated as fact that U.S. intel agencies had determined Russia had paid the Taliban to kill Americans in Afghanistan.

""I don't understand why this president is unwilling to take on Putin when he's actually paying bounties to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan,"" Biden said of President Trump, speaking to Kristen Welker of NBC News during the Oct. 22 presidential debate.

Such a definitive statement was questionable even then. On Thursday, it became more clear that the truth of the matter is unresolved.

Last fall, while Biden was a candidate, Pentagon officials told NBC News they could not substantiate that such bounties were paid.

They still have not found any evidence, a senior defense official said Thursday. And the Biden administration also made clear in a fact sheet released Thursday that the CIA's intelligence on the matter is far from conclusive, acknowledging that analysts labeled it ""low to moderate confidence.""

The White House fact sheet explaining new sanctions over Russian misbehavior made clear that Russia was not being sanctioned over the issue. It used careful language, referring to ""reported Afghanistan bounties.""

""The administration is responding to the reports that Russia encouraged Taliban attacks against U.S. and coalition personnel in Afghanistan based on the best assessments from the Intelligence Community,"" the fact sheet says. ""Given the sensitivity of this matter, which involves the safety and well-being of our forces, it is being handled through diplomatic, military and intelligence channels.""

In intelligence parlance, moderate confidence means the information is plausible and credibly sourced, but not quite corroborated enough to merit a higher rating.

Low confidence means the analysis was based on questionable or implausible information — or information too fragmented or poorly corroborated to make solid inferences. It can also reflect problems with the credibility of the sources.

It's perhaps the latest example of how much uncertainty pervades the gray world of espionage, in which sources aren't always reliable and intercepted communications don't always mean what they seem to. As former CIA director Michael Hayden has said, ""If it was a fact, it wouldn't be intelligence.""

Asked at a press briefing Thursday whether the White House believed the CIA assessment, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki did not answer directly. She said the reason the confidence level was “low to moderate,” is because some of the information came from Afghan detainees, and also due to the challenging operating environment in Afghanistan.

“This information really puts the burden on Russia and the Russian government to explain their engagement here,” she added.

After Biden became president — and began receiving more detailed intelligence briefings — his comments about the alleged Russian incentive payments became more careful. On Jan. 25, for example, he referred to ""reports of bounties.""

The Russian government has denied paying bounties to the Taliban to kill Americans.

Democrats pilloried the Trump administration because the president never raised the issue of alleged bounties with the Russians. Many foreign policy experts said they should have done so, even if the evidence didn't add up to proof.

But in making those criticisms, Democrats, including Biden, imbued the intelligence with a certainty that appears to have been unmerited.

U.S. intelligence agencies have for years documented Russian financial and military support to the Taliban, but the news that the CIA detected a Russian program to incentivize the killing of American service members — first reported last year by the New York Times — appeared to represent a significant escalation.

Officials familiar with the matter told NBC News that the CIA based its findings on two main avenues of intelligence: Financial records seized in a raid in Afghanistan and comments by a detainee.

Military officials say they have looked hard but found no other evidence to corroborate that such a program existed.

In September, Gen. Frank McKenzie, commander of the U.S. Central Command, whose remit includes Afghanistan, told NBC News, ""It just has not been proved to a level of certainty that satisfies me.""

""We continue to look for that evidence,"" the general added. ""I just haven't seen it yet. But … it's not a closed issue.""

McKenzie's comments reflected a consensus view in the military. Defense Secretary Mark Esper told the House Armed Services Committee in July that ""All the defense intelligence agencies have been unable to corroborate that report. ""That has not changed, a senior official with direct knowledge told NBC News Thursday.

McKenzie said in September that if he could establish that the Russians were offering payments to kill Americans, he would push to forcefully respond. But the intelligence is far from conclusive, he said.

""I found what they presented to me very concerning, very worrisome. I just couldn't see the final connection, so I sent my guys back and said, look, keep digging. So we have continued to dig and look because this involves potential threats to U.S. forces, it's open,"" he said, adding, ""I just haven't seen anything that closes that gap yet.""

A U.S. military official familiar with the intelligence added at the time that after a review of the intelligence around each attack against Americans going back several years, none has been tied to any Russian incentive payments.

McKenzie could not be reached for comment, but the official familiar with the intelligence told NBC News Thursday that no Taliban attack had been tied to Russia.",893,5685,11,67

Bill 205, sponsored by MLA Peter Singh of the United Conservative Party of Alberta, was passed after its third reading on March 22, 2021 and received Royal Assent on March 26, 2021.

The bill, titled “Genocide Remembrance, Condemnation and Prevention Month Act” encourages the government to develop strategies to prevent and combat the causes of genocide, recognize the impact of genocides on individuals from various ethnic and religious communities in Alberta, remember the victims and raise awareness on genocides that have occurred across the world.

The bill specifically highlights the Armenian Genocide; the Ukrainian Holodomor; the Jewish Holocaust; the Genocide Against the Tutsi in Rwanda; the Srebrenica Massacre; the Yazidi Genocide and the Rohingya Genocide.

Furthermore, the bill prescribes that “Within one year of the coming into force of this Act, the Minister must complete a report setting out the strategies and proposed actions that the Government commits to undertake to effect the purposes of this Act.”

With the passage of Bill 205, Alberta becomes the second province in Canada – after Quebec – to pass a bill into law, recognizing the Armenian Genocide.

The Canadian Senate recognized the Armenian Genocide in 2002, followed by the House of Commons in 2004 and the Government of Canada in 2006. On April 24, 2015, on the centenary of the Armenian Genocide, the House of Commons unanimously passed Motion-587, declaring the month of April as Genocide Remembrance, Condemnation and Prevention Month in Canada.

0,Woman calls Animal Control over this MYSTERIOUS Creature.,https://www.today.com/food/woman-calls-animal-control-about-tree-creature-was-croissant-t215392,"Animal welfare representatives are breathing a sigh of relief after a panicked phone call to their local offices about a strange creature in a tree turned out to be nothing more than a … croissant.

According to a BBC report and a Facebook post, a woman in Krakow, Poland, called her local animal help center, asking for help with something caught in a tree earlier this week:

The full story in the caption gets a bit long, but apparently the woman told officials that ""this creature … he's been sitting in a tree across the block for two days! People don't open windows because they're afraid it's going to enter their house!""

After some description, she suggested it might be an iguana (""legwan"" in Polish).

The officials had to confirm that it wasn't an April Fool's Day prank.

The woman then needed to know they were kneaded on site to fix things immediately. After all, as the storyteller (the post is on the Facebook page for the Krakow Animal Welfare Society, which was reporting from Inspector Adam's ""Inspector's Diary"") explained, maybe someone threw an animal out and it landed in the tree. Perhaps it really was a legwan.

So experts came out, did a search of the neighborhood and there it was, the creature.

A croissant.

D'ough!

Inspector Adam suggested that the pastry was probably tossed out a window to feed the birds, ""and the poor guy got stuck in the fork of lilac twigs (He was sitting there and looked pretty good, releasing his imagination, taking on reptilians, he was almost moving, he was already preparing for the invasion, he was already beginning to look like a dragon child, the surrounding virgins were already trembling....""

Seems like Inspector Adam has a vivid imagination.

So do fans of the agency; one artist, Rynn Rysuje, even created a croissant-creature-legwan drawing that perfectly sums up the hilarity of the situation:

That said, the post did wrap up on a serious note, urging citizens to call when something seems concerning: ""It's better to check and be pleasantly disappointed, sometimes (unfortunately very rarely) laugh, than not react, which can sometimes lead to a tragedy.""

Alas, we have no idea what happened to the creepy croissant. Perhaps it was given to the birds. Perhaps Inspector Adam ate it. We hope someday that there will be a follow-up.

It's the yeast they could do.

""Uh, thanks,"" said Tudor, reluctantly accepting a LifeStyles Xtra Pleasure condom attached to a brochure containing detailed information on proper use of the prophylactic. ""But I really don't, uh, okay, thanks.""

At approximately 2 p.m., while cutting across the University of California–Santa Cruz campus en route to a coffee shop, Tudor encountered a table featuring a hand-painted sign urging passersby to practice safe sex. She was immediately offered a condom by Stephanie Loughlin, a volunteer for the campus organization UC–Santa Cruz Safe-Sex Alliance.

""I could've told them to save it for someone who has even a remote chance of actually using it, but I still have some dignity,"" said Tudor, who hasn't needed a prophylactic since her Feb. 14, 2002 split with then-boyfriend Doug Ryback. ""God, if they only knew how little they were helping me.""

Tudor said she smiled politely when Loughlin, a bubbly 20-year-old, bounded up to her and urged her to ""play it safe.""

""I didn't want to say that in the 11 months since Doug and I broke up, I really haven't been 'playing it' at all,"" Tudor said. ""Thanks for reminding me.""

Tudor said she still has plenty of unused condoms at home.

""I have a box that hasn't been touched since the breakup,"" Tudor said. ""I know they're still there, because I checked for them before going out with that jerk stockbroker Michelle set me up with last month.""

Tudor initially tried to avoid the safe-sex booth, pretending not to hear Safe-Sex Alliance volunteer Ryan Schumann when he shouted, ""Free condom?"" Misinterpreting Tudor's efforts to sidestep the booth as discomfort with the subject of sex, Schumann targeted her for additional education.

""Some people don't like talking about sex, which is why outreach programs like ours are so vitally important,"" said Schumann, 19. ""I told her not to be embarrassed, and that sexuality is a normal, healthy part of everyone's life.'""

""Everyone's except mine,"" Tudor replied when told of Schumann's remarks. ""I decided to spare him that detail, though, and let him blather on about mutual respect and positive sexuality and something about a dance at the student union on the last Friday of every month.""

Despite not needing protection from unwanted pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases, Tudor was offered a choice of condoms by Trojan, Durex, Trustex, inSpiral, and Crown—all placed in a fishbowl along with complimentary packets of Astroglide lubricant and Wet-brand flavored lube pillows.

""When I sort of frowned at the condom in my hand, they pulled me over to pick any that I liked better from their cornucopia of condoms,"" Tudor said. ""Lubricated, non-lubricated, for-her-pleasure, for-his, mint-flavored. They even had ones wrapped in foil that looked like candy coins. Which, I hate to admit, caught my eye for a second. Chocolate, I would've had some use for.""

Declining the offer of an alternate condom, Tudor grudgingly accepted a brochure containing ""fun and safe"" sex practices to try with her purely theoretical partner. She also took a printed sheet listing local health clinics that provide free testing for STDs, a brochure on the correct use of dental dams, and a photocopy of an article about female condoms—none of which remotely interested her.

In the two weeks since Tudor's last major sex-related letdown—her failure to get laid on New Year's Eve despite a willingness to sleep with anyone even slightly attractive—sex had largely been relegated to the back of her mind. On Tuesday, however, Tudor was reminded of her sexless existence every time she opened her purse and saw the free condom.

""Back in college, when I was screwing with reasonable regularity, I'd actually spend time thinking about the subject [of safe sex],"" Tudor said. ""I'd worry if carrying a condom in my purse was being too forward. I'd think, is it okay to have sex with friends? What sort of stuff do I want to explore? Are threesomes safe? I had no idea that one day, my safe-sex questions would boil down to, 'Where can I get some?'""

Loughlin, who has volunteered for UC–Santa Cruz Safe-Sex Alliance since September, said she sees the unwillingness of some people to discuss sex as a problem facing safe-sex activists.

Advertisement

""Some people are, like, really weird about sex, and that totally sucks,"" said Loughlin, adjusting a ""Be On The Safe Side!"" banner. ""That's why I'm here. The more open everyone is about it, the less people will die.""

""God, I remember back when I was her age,"" Tudor said. ""I was dating this guy who lived in Arizona, but I kept cheating on him with this guy on my dorm floor: Kyle? Karl? He was a rock climber, a real outdoorsy type—kinda skinny but strong. You know, with these nice knotty muscles. I'm sorry, what was your question?""",837,5104,7,47

It seemingly marked the end of a very dark period in Greece’s recent history, but Golden Dawn’s second-in-command Christos Pappas, sentenced to at least 13 years in jail for running a criminal organisation, disappeared after failing to turn up at court. Officially, no one knows where Pappas currently is. Unofficially though, it’s a very different, and wild, story involving radical monks, cops with far-right sympathies, and a convicted war criminal.

ATHENS – The birthplace of democracy has a major Nazi problem. For six months now, cops and intelligence officials have searched fruitlessly for a leading figure of a far-right criminal gang that was for a time Greece’s third biggest political party.

Two weeks later, the same three-judge panel dropped sentence after sentence on 57 members of the group’s leadership, most receiving about 13 years. It should have been a great victory against fascism, except Pappas, the group’s second-in-command, and Ioannis Lagos, Golden Dawn’s only elected member of the European Parliament, didn’t show up to be jailed. Lagos still sits in a Brussels apartment having invoked diplomatic immunity as an MEP, arguing that his conviction was a political witch hunt. His immunity will almost certainly be voided as the pandemic-slowed wheels of bureaucracy eventually catch up with him, but in the meanwhile he still collects his €9,000 monthly salary (about £7,750), and is furious to have been stripped of his daily €323 allowance (about £280).

On a beautiful autumn day last October, tens of thousands of Greeks gathered around the heavily guarded central courthouse in Athens to hear three judges convict the top leadership of the ultra-nationalist party that had terrorised leftists and immigrants across the country for over a decade, for a menu of crimes ranging from operating a criminal gang, to murder. With the convictions, the judges finally ended Golden Dawn’s leap from a violent racist rabble to a violent racist rabble-like political party that received millions of euros in annual taxpayer-funded support from Greece and the European Union.

When compared to its formation on the bloody ethnic battlefields of the post-Communism Balkans and its heyday as a political party that murdered its enemies in public, Golden Dawn’s demise was relatively wholesome.

But the cops have nothing on Pappas, a former member of the Greek parliament and fan of Nazi cosplay . Half a year later, no one knows where he is.

They didn’t just work out together. The cops loved to vote for Golden Dawn as they rose to become the third biggest party in Greece in 2012, with police voters giving Golden Dawn heavy support in some areas, according to a 2012 analysis by Al Jazeera. But after the one-time street gang achieved a huge electoral breakthrough to win about 7 percent of the votes, which got them into the Greek and European Parliaments, the situation changed massively, said Parras.

Every weekend there were attacks on immigrants, hundreds of them never reported from what we can determine because of fear of having wrong papers.

“In the 1990s and early 2000s, the police and security forces wanted Golden Dawn to do their dirty jobs for them in suppressing Leftist demonstrations, the anarchists and their demonstrations,” Parras said of the era that saw widespread violence between the ultra-left and right. “There was coordination between MAT [the notoriously rugged special riot police] and Golden Dawn — MAT is often recruited from the ranks of the [Army] Special Forces and it’s been well established they coordinated during this era. And there’s the natural affinity of young men in special forces going to gyms, similar ideas of the body and martial fitness. A lot of them worked out together.”

That Golden Dawn and Greek police and security units have close fraternal and, even at times, operational relationships, became impossible to deny after a series of arrests in 2013, according to journalist Dimitris Parras, whose unrelenting coverage of the group’s early days was basically ignored in Greece. So it’s hard for many Greeks to take the police claims that they’d properly monitored Pappas’ years-long house arrest seriously.

For civil society, immigrants, and Greece’s committed leftist community that had all been targeted by Golden Dawn’s violence, Pappas’ disappearance is a rude twist to what could have been a reasonably happy ending, and fast becoming a stain on Greece’s international reputation. There’s a sinking feeling that Pappas escaped justice with the help of the Greek security services, the Orthodox Church, and a convicted Serbian war criminal.

“They had a big plan to climb the staircase into the EU and get its money as a political party,” he said, but prior to that Golden Dawn had spent years attacking immigrants – in both an organised and random way.

Prior to its electoral breakthrough in the 2012 Greek elections, when it began winning about 7 percent support in successive elections through to 2015, Golden Dawn mainly focused on beating up immigrants and left-wing political figures, according to lawyer Kostas Skarmeas. He represented three Egyptian fishermen nearly beaten to death in their Athens apartment by a local Golden Dawn unit, in a trial which revealed the attack to be a planned operation led by local party members.

Six months after Pappas disappeared, the official line is he’s in Greece and will be found. But several people, from Greek security officials to regional intelligence officers who have worked war crimes cases in the Balkans, told VICE World News of their suspicions of more official involvement in his disappearance.

And it's that sense of collaboration between the centre-right and far-right in Greece that has Golden Dawn’s victims wondering if these ties – between the parties, the powerful and conservative Orthodox church that often considers itself the arbiter of what is truly Greek, and the security forces – will allow Pappas to never serve his prison term.

He’s not exaggerating, according to witness accounts and residents of the central Athens neighbourhood of Victoria, a centre of refugee and immigrant life in Greece.

“Every weekend there were attacks on immigrants, hundreds of them never reported from what we can determine because of fear of having wrong papers, being a refugee or because the perception that the police were aligned with Golden Dawn,” said Skarmeas.

Asked how many people he personally knew who were attacked in such a manner, Ali suggested at least six personally and says he’s known of dozens more. It was common in a community with few Greek friends.

We were protecting immigrants from the Nazis that the cops had sent after us.

“Terrible time, terrible people,” said ‘Ali,’ a shopkeeping immigrant originally from Bangladesh, who arrived in 1995, speaking on the condition of anonymity. “People would run home after dark from the shops because there would be men chasing you for being an immigrant.”

“They would hunt in packs like wolves looking for someone alone to attack, it was every weekend for years,” they said, asking not to be named because they’re no longer involved in anarchist causes.

“There were at least 40 attacks on immigrants that led to serious medical care or hospitalisations over that period [roughly 2010 to 2012] in Victoria,” said the activist in neighbouring Exachia, home to a number of hard-left anarchist collectives who still periodically clash with police riot squads.

Ali’s account sounds about right to a one-time leader of an anarchist group in a nearby neighbourhood that tried to provide security for immigrants by brutally brawling with Golden Dawn members.

Outside of some dedicated reporters like Parras, Greeks didn’t want to see the armed gangs literally beating people with impunity on their streets and Greek mainstream right politicians – who share a lot of common ground with the hard right on the issue of immigration – were eager to share political spoils with allies willing to aggressively attack their political enemies. And we are talking about literal attacks.

But after 2012, the racist gang of Golden Dawn had gone legit in the eyes of Europe’s political establishment. And Greece’s mainstream right parties were clearly looking to work with them. Eagerly, in fact, despite the ongoing campaign of attacks that never became a political issue because the victims were often illegal immigrants or radical leftists. The establishment, starting with the police up through the ministries and even to the media, found them easy to ignore and dismiss.

“Today the [anarchist] movement is dead, the government and various internal and external political conditions have ended most of the militant leftists and anarchist groups,” they said. “But in that era these were real fights, not the political performances you often see with ‘Antifa’ today. These were leftists going out together to battle racist Nazis in what felt like a true ideological fight for Greece. People died on both sides but it was always clear what side the cops were on. We were protecting immigrants from the Nazis that the cops had sent after us.”

About 50 guys made it in time to receive the baseball bats, clubs and knives being distributed by officials from what was, at the time, Greece’s third largest political party. The cause for action? Leftist rapper and union activist Pavlos Fyssas was sitting in a nearby cafe with a handful of friends watching Olympiakos play Paris Saint-Germain.

At about 11pm on Sunday, September the 17th, 2013, the members of Golden Dawn’s Nikea branch received a text message from one of their top leaders, Giorgos Roupakias, that everyone had ten minutes to get to the local Golden Dawn office.

“All that changes after the murder but the personal ties and relations are still very strong,” he said.

“Golden Dawn supported the regime and its laws, often voting for them,” said Parras of the right-wing government in power at the time. “At this stage we saw an open collaboration between politics and the security services and Golden Dawn was part of this.”

But there’s no version of tough that can handle 50 Nazi skinheads carrying bats and knives jumping you and a handful of friends with the intent to kill. And the testimony in court, which lays out the run up and organisation of the murder in sickening detail, makes it absolutely clear that Roupakias came for murder as he and five other men with knives specifically hunted down Fyssas among his wildly outnumbered friends, who’d gone from drinking beer and watching football to fighting for their lives. Of course they killed him, there was never any intention for this to be a fair fight – it was an assassination.

A well-known figure in both the Greek leftist and hip hop scene, Fyssas was a committed enemy of Golden Dawn and the hard right – not to mention a pretty tough guy: A member of the Syndicate of Metalworkers of Piraeus, just like his father.

“There was millions of euros in the hands of a criminal gang,” said Skarmeas of the period between the 2012 elections and the murder of Fyssas, whose slaying he said represented Golden Dawn’s shift away from targeting immigrants to “focus[ing] on attacking the Greek Antifa-Communist movements.”

Warrants were issued, and raids on offices and members’ homes found the hard drives and mobile phones that proved the longstanding but not publicly admitted ties between Golden Dawn and the mainstream parties.

Starting to understand why we figure Pappas won’t get caught? At home these guys are protected by the government but they can travel because they have lots of friends in the Balkans.

If nobody cared about scores of brutally beaten immigrants, the notion that a political party had openly organised the murder of a political opponent via text message – and then committed that murder in public with scores of attackers – finally defined Golden Dawn in terms that even the most craven political opportunists on the mainstream right couldn’t ignore any longer.

“Starting to understand why we figure Pappas won’t get caught?” an Athens resident told VICE World News. “At home these guys are protected by the government but they can travel because they have lots of friends in the Balkans.”

“After the arrests, inspections of the laptops and mobile phones showed close communication with [politicians who today back the ruling New Democracy Party] speaking as friends, trading votes,” he said.

The “filthy” monastery, it turns out, really is filthy because it’s a neo-Nazi squat, according to a church official, who told the local press that he believed Pappas had sheltered at the Esphigmenou Monastery on Mt Athos, famous for being in the hands of renegade conservative monks since the 1970s.

“If they haven’t arrested him in some filthy monastery in Greece within a few weeks, he’s probably with ultra-right Serbs who got him out,” he added. “He’s got ties to Šešelj and the Serbs going back to the Balkan wars, check out the Greeks at Srebrenica.”

“The Golden Dawn guy? We think that crazy fucking Serb cult got him out,” he said via encrypted messenger, explaining he’d worked undercover in Greece on a related operation about a decade ago. “Yeah [Golden Dawn] has close ties to the security services but in a case like this he can’t hide forever because most of the cops in Greece are actually looking for him.”

A central European intelligence official who works in counter-intelligence in the Balkans was forthright when asked about the Pappas situation in January.

The legal battles and church schisms involved are literally too Byzantine to explain in detail, but Mt Athos, an isolated, rocky peninsula in northern Greece, is legendary or infamous depending on your religious point of view. Filled with more than a dozen monasteries and cut off from the mainland, it’s basically been controlled by monks in near-complete religious rebellion against mainstream church authorities since 2002. The community is so extreme that it can’t reconcile with the already hardline Greek Orthodox Church, which itself refused to stop offering communion from the same silver spoon to elderly people during the pandemic. The stated reason was Satan poses a bigger threat than COVID.

Vartholomaios, who like the Greek police, intelligence services, justice ministry and prime minister’s office, refused to speak on the record for this story, is the legally assigned abbot to the monastery and the cult of radical monks has been occupying his belfry since the 1970s. He cheered the October verdicts against Golden Dawn because he claimed the group had been using the place as a hideout and training camp, with even rumours of people being held prisoner.

We will of course look for him with any lead here in Greece. But I think that’s only if he comes back. He’s being hidden by his Serb friends.

“When I heard that Pappas had disappeared, my first thought was they have him in the monastery. I don’t know if they have investigated, but the police would have a hard time trying to search the monastery, which they have turned into a fortress,” Abbot Vartholomaios of Esphigmenou Chapter of Mt Athos told the Greek newspaper Kathimerini.

“We will of course look for him with any lead here in Greece,” said the official. “But I think that’s only if he comes back. He’s being hidden by his Serb friends.”

“If he wasn’t there himself, it was being used by the people helping him hide and we have information Athos was part of the journey out of the country into Serbia or Kosovo,” said the Greek police official, who pointed to an international arrest warrant issued by Greece in February.

Police did actually raid the monastery in February but missed Pappas. A Greek police official, speaking on background, believed Pappas had used the area as a hideout after he first went missing following his last October check-in with police before he was due to be jailed.

“Šešelj is part of that old [network] used after the wars in the 1990s to keep people out of war crimes trials,” said the central European intelligence officer, who worked in Serbia and Kosovo on war crimes cases. “His ten years in prison in The Hague, his role in the pre and post war political movement of ultra-Serbian nationalism makes him very well respected in these circles. Is he the most powerful man in Serbia? Far from it, but he’s got the ability to hide an old Nazi from Interpol. At least for awhile.”

“It is worth noting that the Golden Dawn had close relations with Šešelj, for example he visited Thessaloniki in 2017 and he gave a press conference together with Golden Dawn,” one activist said, providing a link to the event.

And what Serb friends Pappas appears to have. Vojislav Šešelj, a hardline Bosnian-Serb politician convicted of war crimes and living openly in Serbia, was named by three officials, including the central European intelligence officer, as a close friend of Pappas with even closer ties to the radical elements of the Orthodox Church very much suspected of direct involvement by almost everyone VICE World News spoke to for this story.

“By the time of the sentencing two weeks later we have intelligence that indicates he’d passed through [North] Macedonia into either Serbia or Kosovo, with repeated mentions he was dressed as a monk,” said the Greek police official.

All three officials agree that, using monasteries in Mt Athos as a support hub, Pappas had moved to the area around the beginning of October.

The Serbian political entities in Republika Srpska and Kosovo are considered much more nationalistic and work harder to protect fugitives than Serbia proper, according to multiple war crimes investigators who worked in the region.

“That's the official line and it's the truth,” said the Serb diplomat. “The unofficial line is we know that these radical friends of his helped him escape Greece and while he probably passed through Serbia, I don’t see much evidence he stayed, the most logical and safest thing for him would have been to move to remote areas of [Serbian-held] Kosovo or [the Bosnian Republika Srpska] to hide with the crazy monks. If we find him in Serbia we will arrest him but in those places I don’t know who can do it.”

Serbs really don’t like to give up Serbs. And Pappas might be popular with radicals but he’s not Serb.

The Serbs deny everything officially, but a foreign ministry official told VICE World News that police were actively searching for Pappas based on tips and would certainly arrest him if he was found.

The Central European official agrees that Serbia wouldn’t kill itself looking for Pappas, but with enough pressure it would be perfectly willing to arrest him.

“This is consistent with Pappas having grown a beard while on trial and awaiting sentencing, we used to joke he was doing it for the church,” said Parras, the reporter who followed Golden Dawn for years.

“Serbs really don’t like to give up Serbs,” he said. “And Pappas might be popular with radicals but he’s not Serb and I can’t see the Serbian government willing to take pressure over him. But if he’s in [Republika Srpska] or Kosovo? Those are much more radical local governments with far less influence over the monks, and we learned [from] hunting down Serb war criminals in the 1990s that [non-monk] Serbs might turn on a Serb but the monks will never cooperate with the police.”

And Golden Dawn certainly has war-crime credibility with those elements of ultra-Serbian nationalism going back to the early 1990s, via dozens of Greek volunteers who went to Serbia and Bosnia to fight as the former Yugoslavia violently fell apart.

In its earliest days, Golden Dawn actually hated ethnic Slavs and even pushed for eliminating Christianity all together from Greece in a return to its neo-pagan roots. But this stance proved to be too metal even for the Greek hard right, and the fighting in nearby Bosnia – defined by many in Serbia and Greece as a battle against Turks not Bosnians – unified the movement under a version of Orthodox nationalism and ethnic paranoia. And while at the time Golden Dawn was just one of a number of tiny groups in the right wing scene, dozens of members of the Greek hard right fought alongside the Serbs in their own Greek volunteer unit. And about a dozen Greek fighters were present at the fall, and subsequent massacre at Srebrenica in 1995.

The Athens neighbourhoods of Victoria and Exachia are no longer the scene of pitched battles between Communists and Nazis, as the restive anarchist squats have been badly weakened by arrests and police pressure, and the Nazis remain quiet or locked up after the trials. But the surrounding streets and parks are heavily patrolled by riot police and motorcycle jump-out teams that conduct heavy-handed lockdown checks and often demand papers from carefully masked refugees. In many cases the fear of Golden Dawn has been replaced by fear of the police.

But still the change is noticeable, even during a stroll in a local park. Hundreds of Greeks and refugees – mostly South Asian and Afghan – mingled together, playing cricket and football, enjoying the sun.",3562,21476,20,140

The Dogecoin (CCC:DOGE-USD) cryptocurrency is getting traction from high-profile investors. Back in February, it was actually more of a rounding error, as it was trading for $0.002.

Source: Orpheus FX / Shutterstock.com

But as the crypto craze got into gear, Dogecoin would quickly go on to hit a high of $0.082605 before crashing and bouncing even higher. It’s trading this morning at somewhere around $0.14.

The origins of Dogecoin go back to 2013. The founders included Billy Markus, who was a software engineer at IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Jackson Palmer, who was a developer at Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE).

“The cryptocurrency DogeCoin gained popularity in 2013, after its creators created a satire about the proliferation of dubious crypto coins during that same year,” said James Page, who is a technical writer and executive for Cryptohead. “It is said to be started as a joke, because it was inspired from a viral meme ‘Doge.’”

But of course, Dogecoin is now pretty serious. So why is this the case? And what are the prospects for this digital currency?

Well, let’s take a look.

A Backgrounder

The two founders of Dogecoin have since left the project. However, they did create a thriving community on Reddit which has allowed for strong growth.

An example of the power of this is when the Dogewallet was hacked in the early days.

“Normally, this would be a bad PR day for any cryptocurrency or firm,” said Richard Gardner, who is the CEO of Modulus. “In this case, however, the community came together to compensate the victims, and a tragic event brought users even closer together. It is the sense of community that makes DOGE coin, parody or not, really quite unique among the altcoins market.”

Keep in mind that Dogecoin is used primarily for smaller transactions, say for tipping people. “I think it’s because of this usability that demand naturally increased over time,” said Morgan Taylor, who is the CEO of Sourcery.

The Dodgecoin platform is based on open source and has a robust technology core.

“Today it has some serious benefits like super-fast transactions that you can send to anyone anywhere in the world for less than a penny in fees,” said Ben Weiss, who is the CEO of CoinFlip. “Dogecoin was never designed to hold much intrinsic value. Unlike Bitcoin, there is no cap on how many dogecoins will be minted.”

Now one of the biggest recent catalysts for Dogecoin has been Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Elon Musk. He tweeted the following: “Dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency. It’s pretty cool.”

But of course, there are also a myriad of other influencers that are fans of Dogecoin. One is billionaire Mark Cuban, who has announced that his NBA team – the Dallas Mavericks – will accept the currency for the payment of tickets and merchandise.

Where Now?

As should be no surprise, there are many price targets for Dogecoin. And some are quite bullish. For example, Coinpedia predicts that it will hit $1 by the end of this year. The same goes for the European Review.

This may be a stretch. But then again, if there continues to be more adoption and a few more tweets from Musk, Dogecoin could certainly see more gains. There is also buzz that Coinbase may put this digital currency on its platform. If so, this would represent a nice source of demand.

Yet there is the nagging problem that Dogecoin can be easily created. This is in contrast to Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), which has a relatively fixed supply. Because of this, a shortage can dramatically increase the value of this digital currency.

In other words, it’s a good idea to be cautious Dogecoin. The crypto market can be quite volatile and it is not necessarily clear which digital coins will ultimately prevail.

Serum Institute of India (SII) CEO Adar Poonawalla on April 16 requested United States President Joe Biden to lift the embargo on export of raw materials to help other countries ramp up COVID-19 vaccine production.



Respected @POTUS, if we are to truly unite in beating this virus, on behalf of the vaccine industry outside the U.S., I humbly request you to lift the embargo of raw material exports out of the U.S. so that vaccine production can ramp up. Your administration has the details.

Poonawalla tweeted: “Respected @POTUS, if we are to truly unite in beating this virus, on behalf of the vaccine industry outside the U.S., I humbly request you to lift the embargo of raw material exports out of the U.S. so that vaccine production can ramp up. Your administration has the details.”

His tweet comes following Oxford-AstraZeneca’s legal notice to the Serum Institute, which manufactures Covishield – one of the coronavirus vaccines being administered in India.

Poonawalla had said earlier that SII would need around Rs 3,000 crore to ramp up COVID-19 vaccine production capacity.

The vaccine maker hopes to increase its capacity of Covishield production to 110 million doses per month June onwards.

SII has already delivered over 100 million doses to India and exported around 60 million doses to other countries.

WHO Europe Director Hans Kluge warned that the situation remains ""serious,"" with about 1.6 million new cases reported each week in the region.

Speaking on vaccine fears, Kluge said the risk of people suffering blood clots is far higher for people with COVID-19 than people who receive AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine.

AstraZeneca effective and preventing deaths

Speaking to reporters during a visit to Greece, Kluge did point to “early signs that transmission may be slowing across several countries'' and cited ""declining incidence""' among the oldest people.

""For now, the risk of suffering blood clots is much higher for someone with COVID-19 than for someone who has taken the AstraZeneca vaccine,"" he said.

""Let there be no doubt about it, the AstraZeneca vaccine is effective in reducing COVID-19 hospitalization and preventing deaths."" He said the WHO recommends its use for all eligible adults.

Worldwide death toll

The Johns Hopkins University found that overall nearly 3 million deaths have been linked to COVID-19 worldwide — with the Americas hardest hit. The United States, Brazil and Mexico have reported the highest number of deaths, collectively at more than 1.1 million.

One of the first countries on the path to normality is the UK, easing restrictions for the first time in months on Monday.

Western governments should treat people who insult the Prophet Mohammed the same as those who deny the Holocaust, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said Saturday.

Speaking after a week of violent protests in Pakistan by a radical Islamist party outraged by French government support for magazines publishing cartoons of Mohammed, Khan said insulting the prophet hurt Muslims around the world.

""We Muslims have the greatest love & respect for our Prophet,"" he tweeted. ""We cannot tolerate any such disrespect & abuse.""

The group Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) was banned Thursday after days of violent protests during which four policemen were killed.

The radical party has orchestrated a months-long campaign for the expulsion of the French ambassador to protest against President Emmanuel Macron's defence of the cartoons' publication.

>> Islamist party Tehreek-e-Labbaik fuels anti-France violence in Pakistan

The French embassy in Islamabad on Thursday recommended its nationals leave Pakistan, a call that appears to have gone largely unheeded.

""I... call on Western govts who have outlawed any negative comment on the holocaust to use the same standards to penalise those deliberately spreading their message of hate against Muslims by abusing our Prophet,"" Khan tweeted.

Denying the Holocaust is illegal in several European countries -- including Germany and France -- and offenders can be jailed.

Khan suggested the government had not banned the TLP because it disagreed with TLP's motivation, but rather its methods.

""Let me make clear to people here & abroad: Our govt only took action against TLP under our anti-terrorist law when they challenged the writ of the state and used street violence & attacking the public & law enforcers,"" he said.

REUTERS/Stringer

Myanmar junta chief Min Aung Hlaing will attend an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in Indonesia on April 24, Thailand said on Saturday, for his first known foreign trip since he seized power on Feb. 1.

Myanmar has been in upheaval since Min Aung Hlaing ousted an elected government led by democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi. Security forces have killed 728 people, according to an activist group, in an attempt to crush protests.

In the latest violence, security forces shot and killed two protesters in the ruby-mining town of Mogok, a resident told Reuters, while several small bombs went off in the main city of Yangon, wounding several people, media outlets reported.

Myanmar's neighbours have been trying to encourage talks between the junta and the ousted government, but the military has shown little willingness to engage.

Several of the 10 ASEAN leaders, among them Min Aung Hlaing, confirmed they would attend the meeting in Jakarta, Thai foreign ministry spokesman Tanee Sangrat said.

A spokesman for the junta did not answer calls seeking comment.

Pro-democracy politicians including ousted members of parliament on Friday announced the formation of a National Unity Government (NUG) including Suu Kyi and leaders of the anti-coup protests and ethnic minorities.

The NUG has called for international recognition as the legitimate authority, and requested an invitation to the ASEAN meeting in Min Aung Hlaing's place. It could not immediately be reached for comment.

NEW YEAR AMNESTY

The junta released 23,184 prisoners from jails across the country on Saturday under a New Year amnesty, the Prisons Department said, though few if any democracy activists arrested since the coup were thought to be among them.

Saturday is the first day of Myanmar's New Year and the last day of a five-day holiday that is usually marked with visits to Buddhist temples and raucous water throwing and partying in the streets.

Suu Kyi is among 3,141 people arrested in connection with the coup, according to a tally by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP).

""These (freed) detainees are mostly from before Feb. 1 but there are also some who were imprisoned afterwards,"" Prisons Department spokesman Kyaw Tun Oo said by telephone. He said he had no details of the offences for which they had been jailed.

Among those released were 137 foreigners, who would be deported, state television said. It gave no details.

The AAPP said the military continued to seek 832 people in connection with the protests.

Among them are more than 200 people, including several actors, singers and internet celebrities, who have spoken out against the coup and are wanted on a charge of encouraging dissent in the armed forces, which can carry a three-year jail term.

State media announced the names of another 40 wanted people, 20 of them doctors, on Saturday.

MOVIE COUPLE HELD

The Irrawaddy news site said film director Christina Kyi and her husband, actor Zenn Kyi, had been detained at Yangon airport as they were trying to leave on a flight to Bangkok, though it later said they had been released.

The NUG's vice president, Duwa Lashi La, an ethnic Kachin lawyer, said in a New Year message that the road to replacing military rule with democracy would be rough.

""We pledge to continue working with all ethnic peoples to overthrow the military dictatorship and establish a new federal democracy,"" he said.

Hundreds of protesters took to the streets of several towns including Mogok with banners supporting the NUG.

At least three explosions went off in Yangon, wounding several people, media outlets reported. There was no claim of responsibility.

The military has accused protesters of carrying out bomb attacks.

The coup has also triggered clashes between the army and ethnic minority insurgent groups in the north and east.

On Saturday, fighters from the Kachin Independence Army attacked an air base in the north with rockets, one of which hit a nearby village, injuring one person, the Mizzima news agency reported.

The military has defended its coup with by alleging that the result of November's election was fraudulent, although the election commission dismissed the objections.

Suu Kyi faces various charges, including violating an official secrets act that, could see her jailed for 14 years. Her lawyers reject the charges.

1,Christ Returns to NBA,https://www.theonion.com/christ-returns-to-nba-1819563859,"After a two-year hiatus, Jesus Christ returned to the NBA last night, taking the court with his former team, the Atlanta Hawks. Christ, who quit the sport in May 1994 to focus on spreading His message of universal love and compassion, made His triumphant return last night against the Bulls, just in time for Easter Sunday.

Jesus Christ returned to action last night against the Chicago Bulls, chipping in 13 points and 4 assists, and wowing fans with his trademark ""Ascension Dunk.""

Advertisement

The return of Christ, who averaged 18.2 points and 7.3 assists per game during his 10-year NBA career, has excited success-hungry Hawks fans, who are calling Him the team's ""Savior.""

Said Atlanta resident and devout Christian Jeff Voorhees, ""Jesus is Lord.""

Christ's decision to return to the Hawks surprised insiders, considering that for years the Nazareth native had been crucified by the Atlanta press. Since He was drafted third overall out of Texas A&M in 1986, Christ has been labeled too passive and forgiving to ever lead the Hawks to the promised land. Christ, however, has now apparently decided to turn the other cheek.

""I forgive Atlanta Journal-Constitution sportswriter Stan Sheridan,"" Christ said. ""He knows not what he writes.""

The closest Christ came to signing with another team came in December, when He spent 40 days and 40 nights in the desert with Detroit Pistons coach Doug Collins. After consulting His father, God, Christ turned down the Pistons' offer of 30 gold pieces.

""Get thee behind me, Coach Collins,"" Christ reportedly said.

Though some say the media led Christ to quit basketball, many contend He quit after being betrayed by teammate Kevin Willis during a 1994 Celtics-Hawks playoff game. With three seconds left and the Hawks trailing by one, Christ was wide open underneath the basket for an easy layup. Instead of passing to Christ, Willis took a wild shot from three-point range, missing the net completely. After the game, a visibly upset Christ stretched out His arms and said, ""Kevin Willis, why hast thou forsaken me?""

Despite the controversies, Hawks teammates and personnel are excited to have Christ back.

Forward Stacey Augmon, just one of many Hawks players who claims to have a personal relationship with Christ, said, ""He's taught me so much, like how to love your enemies as yourself, to pray for those who hurt you, and when to pass up the three in favor of a higher percentage shot.""

Fans also eagerly await the return of Christ's ""Ascension Dunk,"" a crowd favorite. In the patented move, Christ leaps His less-than-league-average 24-inch vertical, and miraculously ascends toward Heaven, floating in mid-air just long enough to stuff the ball. An accompanying angelic choir momentarily stuns His defenders as the ball comes crashing down on their heads. The move wowed audiences and judges at NBA All-Star Slam-N-Jam dunk competitions two years in a row.

A three-time NBA All-Star, Christ impressed team doctors during a brief, closed-door workout Friday, in which He displayed His still-sharp shooting skills, dribbling ability, and overwhelming love for all mankind.

Team doctors also noted that in contrast to most players who take layoffs, Christ's body fat is just three percent, even lower than when He was playing. Christ attributed the low figure to His recent food-free, 2,000-year out-of-body reign in His Father's Kingdom.

Meanwhile, the league made a special ruling regarding Christ's crown of thorns, deciding that He may wear the headpiece only so long as He does not unwittingly anoint a player with the forgiving power of His Holy Blood.

Though Hawks fans seem certain Christ can help the team, some NBA experts question whether Jesus is the way.

Advertisement

""The healing power of His Holy Love may get the Hawks into the playoffs, but they can't ride that alone to the championship,"" NBA commentator Hubie Brown said. ""What they really need is a solid power forward who can fill the lane, someone like Cliff Robinson.""

Some analysts think that Christ's injuries, along with His added age, may slow Him down.

""Christ isn't going to be 32 forever, and, quite frankly, He hasn't been the same since the Romans drove holes into His hands and feet,"" NBA analyst and former coach Chuck Daly said. ""A painful stigmata injury is difficult to overcome, and it may affect His shooting touch. Still, I'm pretty confident He can rise again.""",731,4496,4,21

""We will progressively lift the restrictions of the beginning of May, which means that we will organize in the summer time with our professionals in France for French European citizens, but as well for American citizens,"" Macron said in an interview with ""Face the Nation"" that aired Sunday. ""So we are working hard to propose a very concrete solution, especially for U.S. citizens who are vaccinated, so with a special pass, I would say.""

France is currently in its third national lockdown as it battles another wave of coronavirus infections, with schools closed through the end of April, travel limited and gatherings prohibited. In a televised national address late last month, Macron attributed the latest surge to new coronavirus variants, which are more contagious and have created ""an epidemic within an epidemic.""

France's death toll from the coronavirus surpassed 100,000, and there have been more than 5.3 million confirmed cases, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Macron said Sunday that France's ministers are ""finalizing the technical discussions"" over easing the restrictions, and officials are crafting a certificate to facilitate travel between European countries with testing and vaccinations.

""The idea indeed is altogether to offer that to the American citizen when they decide to vaccinate or with a PCR test being negative,"" he said. ""So the idea is indeed to always control the virus, to maximize the vaccination and to progressively lift the restrictions.""

The most recent surge in coronavirus cases in France come as vaccinations in the country lag. But Macron said Europe is catching up, with production accelerated, positioning France to meet its vaccine targets. Still, some members of the European Union are considering securing their own supplies of Russia's Sputnik vaccine, which hasn't been approved by the European Medicines Agency yet.

Asked whether he would buy Russia's vaccine, Macron noted European health authorities haven't allowed it yet, so the vaccine cannot be used on French soil.

""At this stage, the Russian vaccine is not recognized by our authorities,"" he said. ""So I don't think that the Russian vaccine today is a solution to an acceleration because it will take time to have the authorization of the European agency and it will take time to produce on our continent such a vaccine.""

In addition to facilitating the vaccinations of French citizens, Macron said it is ""not sufficient just to be focused on the rich countries.""

""I think between now and June, we have to send a maximum doses of vaccine, which is a tiny part of what we get for us, to vaccinate the workers of the healthcare system in Africa,"" he said. ""It's very limited, but these guys are working hard to preserve the health system and this is something we can do. And same in Latin America. After summer, we will accelerate these deliveries. We will accelerate this solidarity. And on top of that, what we have to provide is financing as well for these economies.""",524,3243,11,83

The war of words between the leaders of the two countries began after President Biden, in an interview with ABC News, referred to his Russian counterpart as a “killer”. Mr Putin shrugged off the remarks by saying: “it takes one to know one.”

Mr Putin further invited Mr Biden for a live debate.

“I’ve just thought of this now,” he told a Russian state television reporter. “I want to propose to President Biden to continue our discussion, but on the condition that we do it basically live, as it’s called. Without any delays and directly in an open, direct discussion. It seems to me that would be interesting for the people of Russia and for the people of the United States.”

But the White House press secretary quickly rejected the invite, adding that Mr Biden has “no regrets” for his earlier remarks.

“We are confident that we can continue to look for ways where there’s a mutual interest,” said press secretary Jen Psaki. “​But the president is not going to hold back, clearly, when he has concerns, whether it is with words or actions.”

Earlier in an interview with ABC News, the US president was asked if he thought the Russian leader was “a killer”. Mr Biden responded: “Yes, I do”.

The comments drew sharp reaction from Russia as Mr Putin went on state television to flip Mr Biden’s comments. “We always see our own traits in other people and think they are like how we really are. And as a result, we assess [a person’s] activities and give assessments,” he said.

He further pointed at the US atomic bombing of Japan during the Second World War, as well as its history of slavery and slaughtering Native Americans, noting the painful legacies weighing on the United States.

0,The Honduran president used Facebook to massively inflate his popularity,https://contracorriente.red/en/2021/04/16/the-honduran-president-used-facebook-to-massively-inflate-his-popularity-an-interview-with-sophie-zhang/,"Responding to Zhang’s accusations about Facebook’s priorities, a spokesperson, Liz Bourgeois claimed, “We aggressively go after abuse around the world … As a result, we’ve taken down more than 100 networks of coordinated inauthentic behavior. Around half of them were in networks that operated in countries around the world, including Latin America, the Middle East, and North Africa, and in the Asia region.”

We spoke to Zhang by phone about what she learned about President Juan Orlando Hernández’s use of Facebook, and the potential broader implications of that sort of abuse of social media. This interview has been edited and condensed.

CC: How did you work out that Hernández was falsely inflating his post popularity?

SZ: So it was very silly. I was working for Facebook as a data scientist, on the fake engagement team. By fake, I mean things like fake accounts, hacked accounts, self compromised ones where you give your credentials over to someone else. It was things like people buying fake likes. There are small businesses who want more fans, there are influencers who want more fans. There are spammers who are selling questionable products like air purifiers that will keep you safe from Covid. My job was supposed to be getting rid of this sort of fake activity.

This other work (uncovering political fake engagement), I was doing in my spare time, or spare moments at work. From the start, I was interested in the idea of inauthentic activity acting on politics, and so I started looking for it. I found it in countries like India and Brazil, and in Honduras. Actually, a lot of it in Honduras, relative to its size. I took a screenshot of one of Hernández’s posts and I realized it was very odd, because there were a lot of (Facebook) Pages liking his post. As I looked closer, it was very clear what was going on, and it was very clear it was very bad. I had never seen anything like this before.

CC: What was Hernández doing?

SZ: There were very clearly fake Pages pretending to be real people who didn’t exist, but which were being used to manipulate, in favor of the president of Honduras. And the person running these fake pages was actually one of the page administrators of the president of Honduras. This person had been authorized to have access to the official page of Juan Orlando Hernández, and to make posts on his behalf.

There were thousands of fake Pages. In terms of the activity, I don’t remember the exact volume numbers, but I do remember that in late 2018 and early 2019, roughly half of the activity such as likes, comments. and shares came from fake pages. That’s from memory. It was quite significant.

And it’s actually not that hard (to set up fake Pages). When you make a new account, Facebook goes through a process that ensures that people can’t set up new fake accounts. But it didn’t occur to people (at Facebook) to apply the same concept to Pages. So they could just make a Page, find a profile picture somewhere, make up a name, make another Page, and so on. This has advantages and disadvantages when compared to networks of fake accounts. It can be quite hard to control 50 different accounts because you can only be logged into one at a time in one browser. So maybe I need to have lots of devices, or to keep logging out and in. Whereas switching between pages is much easier, because Facebook set it up so that page administrators, such as people hired to take care of pages for corporations or political parties, can do so easily. On the flip side, it’s very obvious internally, to Facebook, (when people are doing this).

CC: Essentially, it is about manufacturing credibility, right? Is that different to digital advertising or native advertising?

SZ: Yes, essentially. I’m not an expert in politics, so what I’m telling you is more educated speculation. But what I can say is that (the fake engagements and Pages) certainly did make the president (of Honduras) appear to be much more popular than he actually was.

There has been a lot of research about perception, and often what is found is that countries that are on the brink of crisis, countries that might be ruled by dictators who might be facing coups or uprisings – in these regions, perception can be more important than reality.

For example, everyone may hate the dictator, but pretend to still support him (sic), because if they think everyone else does, they will be too afraid of the consequences of (speaking out). And when they are protesting in the streets, when there’s an uprising, the officials and soldiers have to decide who they are going to support.

Ultimately, dictators need not just to be popular, but for people to believe that they are popular.

It’s not the same as advertising, because paying for advertising makes people see that (content) more, but these people can still make their own decisions about what they like and don’t like. But when it comes to falsely inflating popularity, these aren’t real people. I would compare it to when politicians bus in supporters to rallies, because if they didn’t do that, there wouldn’t be any crowds at their events and they would look like failures.

CC: There are national elections coming up in Honduras in November, is it likely that the National Party will continue to try this strategy, even though Facebook has taken down some pages?

SZ: I know that after Facebook took the pages down, a year after I discovered them, (Hernandez´s team) tried to come back with more pages. Facebook immediately stopped them. After, I know they came back using a different tactic of using fake accounts. These were much harder to discover. When I identified them, Facebook was very reluctant to take many of them down. It was still continuing when I left. I can’t say what has happened since I left, or what will happen in the future, but frankly I think it makes sense for them to continue (to employ fake engagement).

CC: Why has Facebook been so slow to act on this?

SZ: It’s a hard question to answer because I can’t read minds and I don’t know what motivates decisions. But what I was often told then, and what I believed at the time but I don’t believe any more, is that there was this loophole (of using Facebook Pages). We hadn’t seen anything like this before. The Honduran government was being cutting edge. So it wasn’t contemplated in the rules, is what I was told. There wasn’t a clear rule against fake Pages.

The reason I don’t believe that explanation any more is that I thought the precedent of Honduras would make a difference. By October 2019 we had a new policy that recognized that Pages could be used for coordinated inauthentic behavior.

Still, I don’t know, I can only guess. And what I believe is that it was a combination of factors. Facebook does take action regarding cases in smaller countries, but usually it’s because someone there, like an NGO or opposition group, has complained to the company. That means those outside people know what is happening and they could go to the media about it. But I was acting within the company, and so it was treated very differently.

Ultimately, Facebook is a company, and it’s goal is to make money. It isn’t interested in issues out of the goodness of its heart. In some cases, what it acts on is about luck, and in other cases I think it is about how important the country is perceived to be. I’m sorry to say it, but Honduras is a small country and it isn’t very wealthy, so I think it wasn’t considered as important to Facebook’s bottom line.

I think people have very high expectations of social media companies. In part because social media companies like to portray themselves as very nice and well-intentioned, and in part because they believe the existing institutions have failed. They don’t expect the government to fix the problem, and ironically that’s because many of the traditional gatekeepers, like the media, have been weakened by social media.

CC: Finally, what can people do?

SZ: I think publishing news articles is important. It is one of the pressure points that Facebook listens to, I know. And at the end of the day if people stop using Facebook it will have no more power, but that’s not likely to happen. But if people threaten to leave Facebook, I think the company would take that seriously. I know Honduras is a small country, but there are other countries who are experiencing similar things in Latin America. So if Facebook doesn’t clean up its act, in terms of cracking down on inauthentic behavior networks, people can threaten to leave, but it requires people to act together in great numbers.",1498,8587,10,72

The humanitarian and economic crisis unleashed by the eruption of the La Soufriere volcano on the Caribbean island of Saint Vincent will last months and could extend to nearby islands, a UN official warned Wednesday.

""It is a crisis that will require a humanitarian response but also a response in terms of rehabilitation"" which could last for several months, said Didier Trebucq, the United Nations coordinator for Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean.

Trebucq, speaking to reporters in New York via videoconference from Barbados, said that the volcano—which had not erupted since 1979—remains active and every day belches up clouds of ash and smoke after erupting on April 9.

The islands of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines have around 110,000 inhabitants, 20,000 of whom had to be evacuated from their homes.

About 4,000 people have been moved to shelters but ""this number is growing,"" Trebucq said.

On Wednesday a French navy ship, Le Ventose, reached Saint Vincent with water and 75 tonnes of humanitarian aid.

Trebucq said that it was hard to know how long the crisis will last. ""Everything will depend on the duration of the volcanic eruptions,"" he said. ""It is possible that it will last a few weeks, it is also possible that it lasts several months.""

Map locating Saint Vincent's La Soufriere volcano

The eruption will have a medium and long term impact on Saint Vincent as well as nearby islands including Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda, and others.

The French islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe may also be impacted ""depending on the direction of the winds and where the volcanic ash is deposited,"" he said.

In calling for more robust international aid Trebucq noted that hurricane season in the Caribbean is set to begin in two months, and that tourism, the main source of income for the islands, has been severely curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Things have not worked out exactly according to Castro's plan.

As Castro announced he was stepping down on Friday, his country is deep in crisis. The tourism-dependent island has been battered by the pandemic; the economy shrunk at least 11% in 2020 according to government estimates. Cubans each day spend hours in long lines to find increasingly scarce food, medicine and other necessities.

While Cuban officials have made an all-out effort to thwart the spread of the coronavirus, cases are at an all-time high on the island. It will likely take many more months to know if Cuba's ambitious, ""Hail Mary"" plan to develop the island's own homegrown vaccines will prove successful.

With then-US President Barack Obama, Castro mended long fraught US-Cuban relations, only to see those ties blown up again under the Trump administration which enacted some of the toughest economic penalties on the island in decades.

But so far, current President Joe Biden has been reluctant to engage with the communist-run island despite the most significant change in leadership in Cuba in decades.

""Regardless of what administration we have, Republican or Democrat, it's a good time to engage,"" said former Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ), a rare member of the GOP to push for improved relations, who met with Raul Castro during frequent trips to Cuba. ""It benefits the Cuban people and puts pressure on the Cuban government that they don't have when we try to isolate them.""

It's difficult to imagine a more precarious time for the last members of the aging generation that transformed Cuba into a socialist state to finally relax their hold on power.

Despite deepening uncertainty, Cubans witnessed an historic changing of the guard at this week's 8th Congress for the Cuban Communist Party, ""the supreme body"" of the only political party permitted on the island.

The congress started Friday, timed to commemorate the 60th anniversary of Cuba's victory over CIA-trained exiles during the Bay of Pigs invasion.

Even if the outgoing head of the party's family continues to wield unquestionable power on the island, once the congress is over, no one with the last name Castro will occupy a senior position of leadership for the first time in over 62 years.

Since the early years of the revolution, Cuba's head of state has always led the party, making it nearly impossible to determine where the government ends and the party begins.

But in 2018, Castro stepped down as president, making way for his handpicked successor, Miguel Diaz-Canel, to take over running the day-to-day management of the government. Castro stayed as head of the party, which oversees long term planning, but said Diaz-Canel would likely assume that position too in 2021

""After that,"" Castro said in 2018, ""If my health permits it, I will be just one more soldier with the people, defending this revolution.""

His departure brings an end to the era of his famous clan occupying the top leadership on the island. None of the children of Castro's older brother, Fidel, who died in 2016, hold government posts.

Raul Castro's son, Alejandro, is a colonel in Cuba's Interior Ministry and his daughter, Mariela, runs a government center promoting LGBTQ rights. A son-in-law, Gen. Luis Alberto Rodríguez López-Callejas, heads a sprawling military company that controls state-owned hotels, marinas and infrastructure projects but he maintains a low public profile.

Cuba is one of the countries that has changed the least since the end of the Cold War, even as government officials acknowledge the island desperately needs to adapt. Finding the path to modernizing Cuba's economy will now fall squarely on the shoulders of Miguel Diaz-Canel, Castro's successor as president who is expected to take over as head of the communist party.

Trained as an electrical engineer, Diaz-Canel ran local governments in two provinces before becoming minister of higher education and then vice president and president.

Diaz-Canel is the first Cuban who was born after the 1959 revolution to become president. Gaining the leadership of the party will further establish the tall, grey-haired technocrat as the political heir to the Castros. But it remains unclear how he differs from his predecessors.

""I believe in continuity,"" Díaz-Canel told reporters in 2018 when asked about his vision for Cuba's future. ""I think there always will be continuity.""

Diaz-Canel has tried to project a more active image to the Cuban public, posting on Twitter regularly. He immediately visited the still-smoldering scene of a passenger plane crash in 2018 in Havana that killed 112 people, and he holds cabinet meetings across the island as Fidel Castro used to.

JUST WATCHED CNN granted rare access to Cuban presidential tour Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN granted rare access to Cuban presidential tour 03:19

The optics may have changed somewhat but Diaz-Canel is a vocal adherent to the ideology that rigid state control of the economy remains the best way forward for Cuba, despite decades of stagnant economic growth. And any public opposition to the party line, he has said, is the work of Cubans who are ""mal nacidos"" or born in the wrong country.

Even with all the official talk of maintaining the course, Cuba is changing. Many in Cuba's nascent private sector complain openly about the slow pace of reforms. Artists fed up with official censorship and activists pushing for legislation protecting animal rights have used increased internet access to organize and publicize small protests that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.

As Cuba's government faces increased challenges and threats, some hardliners may be wary of Raul Castro's exit. But former Senator Jeff Flake told CNN that Castro is likely resist any last-minute appeals to remain.

""He seems a lot more willing to walk into the sunset certainly than his brother did. He would always talk about his grandkids and his family,"" Flake said.

""But really to move on, to enact the reforms that Cuba needs, they will need to move well beyond the Castros.""

0,Titanic 1912 disaster: 'Greenish beams' seen by survivors spark new theory,https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/titanic-disaster-greenish-beams-seen-by-survivors-spark-new-theory/YA7GMR6XHAZ6AKZCEB2X7CZY7Y/,"RMS Titanic departing Southampton on April 10, 1912. Photo / F.G.O Stuart

As survivors of the Titanic sinking floated in the freezing waters of the northern Atlantic Ocean, glowing lights spread across the sky.

Some called them ""greenish beams"". Others called them hallucinations. But no doubt, they were real.

It was a beautiful night. Dark, but full of starlight in the early hours of April 15, 1912. The weather was calm, the sea smooth. The conditions extraordinary: bitterly cold. Perfectly still. By this stage, the deathly screams had faded from the air.

The bright lights, according to some of the 706 survivors left, had appeared earlier in the night, when passengers were being loaded into lifeboats as the Titanic swiftly sank to her watery grave.

Some watched from the deck of the ship, others watched from the safety of lifeboats already at sea.

""They seemed so near, and their light so much more intense than ever before, that fancy suggested they saw this beautiful ship in dire distress below and all their energies had awakened to flash messages across the black dome of the sky to each other; telling and warning of the calamity happening in the world beneath,"" wrote survivor Lawrence Beesley.

""The stars seemed really to be alive and to talk.""

Little did he know at the time that while the beauty of the light show distracted some from the horrors unfolding before them and eventually helped rescuers spot people in the water, it could have been a huge part of the problem.

More than 100 years later, new research suggests it was those very lights — the northern lights – that helped bring the Titanic to her untimely demise.

The research, conducted by weather expert Mila Zinkova, suggests a geomagnetic storm taking place that night would have played havoc with the ship's navigational system in the run-up to the disaster, hindering subsequent rescue efforts and adding more confusion to the scene as it unfolded.

The research was published in the journal Weather late last year.

""The significant space weather event was in the form of a moderate to strong geomagnetic storm that observational evidence suggests was in effect in the North Atlantic at the time of the tragedy,"" Zinkova says.

She suggests that while the light show was playing in the sky above, it was also changing the Titanic's compass – a marvel not yet uncovered by science.

109 years ago 1 of the worlds most famous shipping catastrophes took place as the #Titanic,the largest & most impressive ship ever built at the time, crashed into an iceberg as it travelled from Southampton>New York.

The slightest change of even 0.5 degrees would have been cataclysmic for the ship and put it on its fatal collision course.

""This apparently insignificant error could have made the difference between colliding with the iceberg and avoiding it,"" she writes.

Ship steered off course

Zinkova suggests the ""unsinkable"" ship was being steered off course by auroras formed by a solar storm.

According to Nasa, the sun ""burps"" high-speed streams of electrifying gas to Earth, sometimes so large it causes a ""mass ejection"". The electrified gas collides with our atmosphere and interacts with atmospheric gases, resulting in beautiful displays of light in the sky.

But it comes with a catch. Ejections like this can also interrupt electrical and magnetic signals.

""When solar storms occur, it could affect compasses and radio communications,"" Zinkova told news.com.au.

At the time of the sinking, Zinkova said, experts did not know about the kinds of communication problems that such events could produce.

But, she said, ""even a very small compass error could have taken [the Titanic] off course"".

An unexplained problem

As rescue ship RMS Carpathia steamed towards the Titanic in the early hours of April 15, second officer James Bisset looked toward the sky and noticed there was no moon. They were about 100km from the site of the disaster.

""But the Aurora Borealis glimmered like moonbeams shooting up from the northern horizon,"" he wrote in his 1959 memoir, Tramps and Ladies: My Early Years in Steamers.

""The air was intensely cold. Though visibility was good, the peculiar atmospheric conditions … made the sea and sky seem to blend into one another, so that it was difficult to define the horizon.""

He watched his boss, Captain Arthur Rostron, standing silently, gazing ahead, and to the sky, watching the play of light from the Aurora Borealis.

""He raised his cap a few inches from his forehead, and uttered a silent prayer, moving his lips soundlessly,"" Bisset said.

The Titanic sank about 2.20am. Survivors' accounts vary of the timing of the lights; there are suggestions they were seen as early as before midnight to when the passengers were picked up towards dawn the next day by the Carpathia.

RMS Carpathia.

""Though the night was cloudless, and stars were shining, the peculiar atmospheric conditions of visibility intensified as we approached the icefield with the greenish beams of the Aurora Borealis shimmering and confusing the horizon ahead of us,"" Bisset wrote.

""My face was smarting in the frosty air as I stood on the wing of the bridge, keeping a lookout for icebergs.""

Survivors reportedly spotted the lights again at around 3am. When Bisset and the crew of the Carpathia approached the wreckage site, he noted the ""greenish beams"" of light surrounding the lifeboats.

Captain Rostron drove the Carpathia full speed into the dark icefield in which the Titanic had met with disaster.

Zinkova suggests the weather event could also have had something to do with inadvertently leading the Carpathia to the crash site.

She explained the Carpathia had been sent the wrong coordinates by the Titanic's crew at the time – 11km away.

""Every ship that was involved [in the disaster], including the Titanic, Californian [a ship nearby the Titanic that failed to heed its distress signal], Carpathia … they all had some unexplained problem with their position.

""The Carpathia was given the wrong position but somehow she navigated directly to the Titanic.""

It was 11.40pm on April 14, 1912, when the Titanic hit an iceberg during her maiden voyage across the Atlantic Ocean, sealing her fate. She sank to her watery grave the following morning, at 2.20am, killing 1526 passengers. This week marks the disaster's 109th anniversary.

""I know that of course the northern lights could not account for every thing that went wrong, but if the Titanic's compass was affected by the northern lights, maybe Titanic would not have collided with this particular iceberg,"" Zinkova said.",1153,7015,11,74

As closing time nears, we expect the president to sow confusion with false claims that he ordered his burger without a pickle or that his appetizer never arrived. If we do nothing and he’s able to convince enough diners, and ultimately get the waitstaff to heel, Bob Evans as we know it may be at an end.” Porter closed his remarks by urging those in power to act now by refusing to refill the president’s water glass and placing the check face down in front of him on the table.",207,1191,16,93

In an order titled “Complete Blocking of Social Media Platforms,” the Pakistani government ordered Pakistan Telecommunication Authority to block social media platforms including Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube and Telegram from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. local time (06.00 a.m. to 10.00 a.m. GMT) Friday.

The move comes as Pakistan looks to crack down against a violent terrorist group and prevent troublemakers from disrupting Friday prayer congregations following days of violent protests.

Earlier this week Pakistan banned the Islamist group Tehrik-i-Labaik Pakistan after arresting its leader, which prompted protests, according to local media reports.

An entrepreneur based in Pakistan told TechCrunch that even though the order is supposed to expire at 3 p.m. local time, similar past moves by the government suggests that the disruption will likely last longer.

Though Pakistan, like its neighbor India, has temporarily cut phone call access in the nation in the past, this is the first time Islamabad has issued a blanket ban on social media in the country.

0,A Gun Bill | No Police State,https://nopolicestate.net/2007/12/21/a-gun-bill-3/,"There was a headline in the news yesterday on the Yahoo homepage that read “Gun bill inspired by “A place where gun violence occurred”, and the article went on to say something about the mentally ill will be targeted and asked for documentation when they go to buy guns. Hugh? Is not the problem with guns that guns are sold everywhere to anyone at all, and not the people.

And there was a sales excerpt in this past weeks Sunday newspaper for a sports store. This advertisement was for the hunting section of their store and it pictured a man dressed in camouflage with a gun tossed over his shoulder and there were photos of guns and rifles with brand names and fancy descriptions for sale all over the page. Are people animals who are people to be hunted? Is hunting for animals and people now considered a sport to be sold in the malls of America and on sales brochures next to roller skates and advertised in the papers for all to see. Is this not the same? Is not the problem that the images of guns are found in television, film, commercials, posters, newspapers, cartoons, video games and marketing and advertisements everywhere these days. Does not advertising influence society.

I could cut and paste my blog entries over and over in my appeal to abolish guns. Guns are the worst invention of an industry ever. Everyday someone loses their lives to random acts of gun violence for no reason at all except for the fact that guns have been invented. It is a story that has been told yesterday and will be told tomorrow with no end in sight. It is an industry that feeds on itself, advertisement breeds crime which breeds news, which breeds crime, which breeds more advertisement which breeds more crime. Will the cycle of the beast that has it’s grip on humanity ever end. Should not guns be abolished from humanity as a whole, from everyone on the face of planet earth.

And then there is that constitutional 4th amendment, the right to bear arms that should be abolished or rewritten to abolish guns and replace them with sticks and stones or something. The idea that property, material goods are worth more than life. And the whole world is paying with the loss of human life which seems to be a disposal commodity in the war industry of people against humanity. Occupy the nra.

And my friend gave me a flyer as we were discussing the latest atrocity of the day in relation to gun violence. It is a flyer she received back in April at Union Square Park of New York City. And it is a flyer about gun violence and psychiatry. The Pharmaceutical industry is bigger than the war industry. Psychiatry Kills. Abolished forced psychiatric treatment. And what’s that “One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest” film by Ken Kesey all about anyway. That’s a whole another blog posting. For all things human rights and psych cia trickery and alternatives to the mental death system, Mindfreedom is a great website to visit. I am one voice, one blogger. Is another world possible. Peace on earth and goodwill to all mankind. And what does this have to do with a No Police State?

And the flyer went on to read:

What caused the tragedy in “this state”?

It was reported in the Times and the Post Wednesday:

The killer had been taking anti-depressants.

All too often in the present age, we hear the tragic news of a senseless massacre somewhere in the country. Experience has shown, that the killer has almost always, if not absolutely always, been someone who had been prescribed anti-depressants.

The killers with names were kids who had been prescribed the anti-depressant ritalin.

The man who shot someone at this place had been prescribed an anti-depressant whose classic symptom is extreme rage directed at one specific person. The killers in the recent massacres in three different states, also one in another state, had been taking various prescription anti depressants.

Pharmaceutical drugs are prescribed, not as a last resort but as a first thought, not hesitantly but hastily and with excess. They are not properly used, but abused, with no thought of the side effects of taking chemicals which nature did not produce and evolution did not plan for us to be subjected to, like bug spray or insecticide. And this is not a small and isolated phenomenon, but rather a deliberate and systematic poisoning of the bodies and minds of the American people, on an epidemic scale.

The concentration of power, Mr. Moneybags, the State, which controls the American military-industrial complex and the pharmaceutical chemical companies that are an integral part of that system, the State, which, as Eisenhower warned, would one day gain undue influence and endanger our Liberties, has an interest in promoting this epidemic scourge of prescription drug use. Hundreds of billions of dollars a year, are made by the corporations that sell these drugs. It is big business. In addition, the State which experience has shown, for thousands of years all over the globe, tends to want to empower itself and dis-empower the People, gets exactly that benefit from this epidemic of drug use. Power and authority, competency and incompetency breeds corruption. It dis-empowers individuals by making them unhealthy. And it dis-empowers the community and the nation, by making people distrustful of each other; by making people think that their neighbor is a crazy person who they must be protected from; by persuading the People to accept, even to demand, increased police power of the State to protect them. Under such conditions even the will to independence vanishes.

The innovations of scientists and engineers are stolen and subverted by the concentrations of power; a virtue has become a vice, and chemical technology, which can and of right ought to be a liberating force in society, becomes enslaving.

Doctors are encouraged, by the drug industry, to prescribe artificial drugs to their patients. It is a regular practice, for the drug companies to pay a doctor a fee every time that doctor prescribes one of their drugs. It is no secret. In this way, the basic essential character of the American medical profession becomes one of conflict of interest.

The companies that make these drugs exert a great deal of pressure upon the mass media. There are huge advertising contracts, and there is an overlap of ownership between the drug companies and the media companies. The fact that a mass murderer was taking prescription drugs, is one of those things that will show up once in the newspapers, but is immediately and finally buried, and mum becomes the word.

There have been a thousand analyses of the killer in papers, of his history, his personality, his psychological problems; there have been a thousand demands for increased police powers; there have been a thousand calls for the outlawing of guns, and a general de-clawing of the People. But has anyone asked, how is it that society produces so many sick people?

Prescription anti-depressants are known to be a common cause of suicide; they are known to be a constant presence in senseless massacres. Surely the number of individual murders caused by these drugs must be many times greater than the number of massacres. And if there are so many suicides and murders, how many people taking pharmaceuticals must be gravely suffering, but have not quite yet arrived at the point of suicide or murder?

This epidemic of drug use, this deliberate poisoning of the bodies and minds of the American people, this deliberate, and thus far largely successful, did-empowerment of the American people, must stop. It is our purpose to reveal this truth to the American people, so that we may once again live in a sane and healthy society and the tragic deaths of so many good people in this State shall not have been in vain.

""If it seems impossible to go on with the games, they must be definitely cancelled,"" Nikai said. ""If there is a surge in infections because of the Olympics, there will be no meaning to having the Olympics.""

Asked if a cancellation was still an option, Nikai said: ""Of course.""

But he also added: ""It is important for Japan to have a successful Olympics. It is a big opportunity. I want to make it a success. We will have many issues to resolve and prepare, and it is important to take care of them one by one.""

Prime Minister Toshihide Suga said in a statement there was ""no change to the government position to do everything to achieve safe and secure Olympics.""

The Canadian Olympic Committee said in a statement that it remains confident that the Games will be staged safely and successfully, ""and (we) look forward to participating at Tokyo 2020.

""Not only because of what we know is being planned by the IOC and Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee to safeguard health and safety but because of our own decisions being made. Our actions will continue to be guided by our Chief Medical Officer and Canadian public health officials.""

Canada led the way a year ago when both the Canadian Olympic and Paralympic Committees announced they wouldn't send teams to Tokyo unless the Games were postponed. Two days later, the IOC announced the Games would be pushed back a year.

Tokyo organizers said they, the IOC and the International Paralympic Committee ""are fully focused on hosting the games this summer."" They said Suga ""has repeatedly expressed the government's commitment"" to holding the Olympics.

COVID-19 cases have been rising across Japan. On Thursday, Japan's second-largest metropolitan area of Osaka recorded 1,208 new cases. It was the third straight day that new cases surpassed 1,000. Tokyo hit 729, its highest total in more than two months. Japan has attributed 9,500 death to COVID-19, good by world standards but poor by results in Asia.

Tokyo and Osaka have been under an alert status since earlier this month, but officials are concerned there is little sense of urgency. Experts on a Tokyo metropolitan government taskforce warned that the new variant could replace the conventional virus and trigger explosive infections by early May. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike urged residents to take maximum protection and asked non-Tokyo residents not to visit the area.

Taro Kono, the government minister in charge of Japan's vaccine rollout, said even if the Olympics go on, there may be no fans of any kind in the venues. He said it's likely that the Olympics will have to be held in empty venues, particularly as cases surge across the country.

That means only television cameras and still cameras will be around to record the action, joined by some reporters, judges and match officials.

The delayed Tokyo Olympics are to open in just over three months on July 23, and the Paralympics follow on Aug. 24. Fans from abroad have already been banned. Now even Japanese spectators could be kept away.

""I think the question is how to do the Olympics in a way that is possible in this situation,"" Kono said Thursday on a television talk show. ""That may mean there will probably be no spectators.""

Kono did not suggest the Olympics would not go ahead, but he said they could be held under only ""certain conditions.""

“The way these Olympics will be held will be very different from past ones,” he said.

Tokyo organizers have said they expect to announce a decision this month on the number of fans allowed into each venue.

Organizers had expected to receive about US$800 million from ticket sales, their third-largest source of income. Any shortfall will have to be made up by Japanese government entities, which are already footing most of the bills.

The official cost for the Olympics is $15.4 billion, but several government audits have suggested it might be twice that much, and all but $6.7 billion is public money.

1,Flustered Wolf Blitzer Cuts To Malaysian Airplane Coverage To Distract From Lack Of Concrete Results,https://www.theonion.com/flustered-wolf-blitzer-cuts-to-malaysian-airplane-cover-1845555289,"ATLANTA—As time continued to pass without any election developments to report, an increasingly flustered CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer cut to coverage of the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 to distract from a lack of concrete results. “We can now conclusively state that Flight 370 did not go down off of the western coast of Australia—repeat, that’s our final call on whether the flight ended up off the coast of Australia, although we can’t yet make any final determination about whether the plane is somewhere else in the Indian Ocean. In the meantime, we’ll go to Anderson Cooper to see if there are any new developments since air traffic controllers lost contact,” stammered Blitzer, as a sweating, visibly nervous CNN analyst John King moved from the network’s Magic Wall showing most states grayed out to a map of Southeast Asia where he marked areas that represented the flight’s trajectory and the last time it had been heard from in March 2014. “Right, so, while the search has covered around 50,000 square miles, it has so far failed to turn up more than parts of a plane’s right wing and right stabilizer that could have been part of the vanished Boeing 777 aircraft, and there’s been a whole host of controversy surrounding the Malaysian government’s response to the plane’s disappearance. While we’re, um, waiting to confirm anything on the West Coast or even get some reliable exit polling out of Michigan or Pennsylvania that might tell us which way the election is going, we’ll be hearing from an official from the International Civil Aviation Association about the likelihood a plane could go missing, and what kinds of changes have been made in aviation safety over the past six years. But first, we’re going to hear from our correspondents Arlette Saenz and Jeff Zeleny, who are waiting for any statements from the Joe Biden campaign, but in the meantime are going to reopen the case of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and explore several key developments that have happened over the past 15 years, and then, uh, depending on what’s happening in Texas, maybe Dana Bash can talk about the Carnival cruise ship from 2013 where many passengers got sick before a power outage turned the boat into a feces-covered nightmare.” The agitated Blitzer added that the network could not confirm how the Malaysia Airlines flight’s 239 passengers and crew members would have voted in the 2020 election.

PRAGUE (AP) — The Czech Republic announced Saturday that it was expelling 18 Russian diplomats who it has identified as spies in a case related to a huge ammunition depot explosion in 2014.

Prime Minister Andrej Babis said the move is based on “unequivocal evidence” provided by the Czech intelligence and security services that points to the involvement of Russian military agents in the massive explosion in an eastern town that killed “two innocent fathers.”

“The Czech Republic is a sovereign state and must adequately react to those unprecedented findings,” Babis said.

Interior Minister Jan Hamacek, who is also serving as the country’s foreign minister, said the 18 Russian embassy staffers were clearly identified as spies from the Russian intelligence services known as GRU and SVR and were ordered to leave the country within 48 hours.

The explosion, which took place on Oct. 16, 2014 in a depot in the town of Vrbetice where 50 metric tons of ammunition was stored, claimed two victims. Another explosion of 13 tons of ammunition occurred in the depot on Dec. 3 of that same year.

Hundreds had to be evacuated from nearby villages after those explosions.

“The United States stands with its steadfast ally, the Czech Republic,” Jennifer Bachus, chargé d’affaires at the U.S. embassy in Prague, said. “We appreciate their significant action to impose costs on Russia for its dangerous actions on Czech soil.”

The Czech announcement came two days after the U.S. said it was expelling 10 Russian diplomats and imposing sanctions against several dozen people and companies, holding the Kremlin accountable for interference in last year’s presidential election and the hacking of federal agencies.

Babis said President Milos Zeman, who is known for his pro-Russian views, has been informed about the development and has “expressed absolute support for us.”

He said the investigation into the case has not yet been completed but thanked the country’s security forces for their “professional job.”

The announcement sent a shockwave across the country, with the politicians from the government parties and opposition united in condemning the Russian move.

“It’s an act of state terrorism,” said Petr Fiala, the head of the opposition Civic Democratic Party.

Jiri Sedivy, former chief the Czech military’s general staff, said the Czechs have to response “resolutely” to the Russian action.

“”It was an obvious military attack on our sovereign territory,” Sedivy told the Czech public television.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said her country would answer the Czech move.

“Prague is well aware of what will follow such tricks,” Zakharova was quoted by the RIA Novosti news agency.

Hamacek said the the case will significantly harm Czech-Russian relations. He said the country’s allies in NATO and the European Union have been informed about the findings and “we’ve asked for their support.”

“We’re in a similar situation like Britain in the attempted poisoning case in Salisbury in 2018,” Hamacek said, without elaborating.

Britain expelled dozens of Russian diplomats after Russian agents used a Soviet-era nerve agent to poison a former Russian spy and his daughter who were living in the English city of Salisbury.

At the same time, the Czech police’s organized crime unit on Saturday published photos of two foreign citizens who visited the country, including the Zlin region where Vrbetice is located, between Oct. 11 and Oct. 16 in 2014 and asked the public for any information about them.

The two were using Russian passports and were identified as Alexander Petrov, 41, and Ruslan Boshirov, 43. Petrov and Boshirov were charged in absentia by Britain in 2018 for trying to kill former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, with the Soviet nerve agent Novichok.

The Czech police said the two men were also using passports issued by Moldova for Nicolai Popa and a passport issued by Tajikistan for Ruslan Tabarov.

They said the two also visited the capital of Prague and another northeastern Czech region.",823,5210,10,58

0,'Made of plastic': Cleaning up Bolivia's Uru Uru lake,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bolivia-environment-idUSKBN2BV2CO,"URU URU LAKE, Bolivia (Reuters) - Bolivia’s Uru Uru lake is more plastic than water, with discarded bottles, containers, toys and tires stretching out towards the horizon, a dystopian image reflecting years of human pollution and the scar of climate change.

The highland lake in the Oruro Department of western Bolivia suffered a major drought in 2016 that drastically lowered its water levels while rivers that flow into it have deposited mountains of plastic waste in its waters over years.

Local volunteers, workers and even a French ‘influencer’ are trying to clear up the mess. On Wednesday hundreds of people gathered up waste from the surface of the lake, whose waters have also been contaminated by nearby industry and mining.

“We are at this moment in a garbage dump, which we have caused since we are the destroyers of the planet,” volunteer Magali Huarachi, 28, told Reuters standing amid plastic bottles on a dried out part of the lake.

“I am now in a lake, but made of plastic.”

Bolivia’s highland lakes are major sites protected under the international Ramsar Convention to conserve wetlands, especially those providing waterfowl habitat. The iconic Lake Titicaca is grappling with pollution and the expansion of cities near its shoreline, while Lago Poopó, formerly the second largest after Titicaca, dried up completely in 2015.

Limbert Sanchez, from the Center for Ecology and Indigenous Peoples (CEPA), said Uru Uru’s water levels had been reduced to around 25-30% of its full capacity, while it had been hit hard by urban and mining pollution.

“Cities are growing, pollution by garbage is growing and gradually that means our Lake Uru Uru is dying, just like our Lake Poopó,” he said.

Alex Dessard, a French social media influencer who helped clean up Bolivia’s famed ‘train cemetery’ on the salt flats of Uyuni, was one of many cleaning up Uru Uru on Wednesday, pulling out tires and other plastic from blackened water.

“It’s a shame that so much garbage has come here because it has accumulated in many years, perhaps a decade. Now we have to think about the future. Let’s clean and then we become aware so that we don’t have to clean again,” he said.

As front loaders and dump trucks hauled away the mountains of rubbish, volunteer Huarachi held out hope.

“I think that if we all do our little bit, by picking up our garbage or coming to help here, then we are going to make this place beautiful in a while,” she said.",422,2475,9,53

By Umberto Bacchi

April 16 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - London's Science Museum came under fire on Friday for having oil and gas major Royal Dutch Shell as a sponsor of an upcoming exhibition on climate change, a move described by environmental groups as ""out-of-step"".

The British museum is set to reopen after coronavirus lockdowns in May with ""Our Future Planet"", a display focusing on carbon capture - the process by which planet-warming gases are sucked out of the atmosphere and stored below ground.

The exhibition, which comes as Britain prepares to host a major U.N. climate summit in November, lists Shell as one of its main sponsors - drawing the ire of green activists.

""It beggars belief that this iconic British institution has freely chosen to link up with Shell ... at such a crucial time,"" Bill McGuire, professor emeritus of geophysical and climate hazards at University College London, said in a statement.

Environmental group Scientists for Global Responsibility said the move was ""irresponsible"", while Culture Unstained, a group campaigning to end fossil fuel sponsorship of culture, accused the museum of aiding ""greenwashing"" efforts.

Ian Blatchford, chief executive of the Science Museum Group, said the museum was transparent about its relationship with energy companies and retained editorial control in all such partnerships.

""Our Future Planet looks at both the cutting-edge technologies and nature-based solutions being developed to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere,"" he said.

""(The exhibition) makes clear that, alongside reducing carbon emissions, carbon capture and storage can be one contribution in the fight against climate change.""

Shell said in a statement its relationship with the museum was based on shared interests to promote engagement in science, adding that it aimed to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.

""Our priority is to avoid emissions, where that is not currently possible, to reduce emissions and, only then, turn to mitigation of emissions, for example through the use of carbon capture and storage technology,"" a spokeswoman said via email.

Carbon capture technologies are seen as a key component in the fight against global warming, with the UK's Climate Change Committee describing their development as a ""necessity"" for the country to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

Yet, critics say underground storage space for captured emissions is limited and focusing on such technologies risks slowing down the transition to green energy sources.

Unfortunately, online scammers out there are taking advantage of buyers like Andrew Friedman, a 33-year-old Sony diehard who thought he was getting an authentic PS5 on eBay, but instead received an original of Mark Rothko’s monumental work 1957 #20, also known as Brown, black on maroon.

Buyer beware! Some people will do anything for a quick buck, even if it means ripping off gamers at their most emotionally vulnerable hour.

“All I wanted to do was play Cyberpunk 2077 and maybe check out the Demon’s Souls remake, and instead, I’m out 1,200 bucks and don’t even know where to put this thing,” said Friedman, sitting in his living room in front of the massive seven-and-a-half- foot- tall work that showcases the Latvian American artist’s mature later period. “At first, when I pulled [Rothko’s masterpiece] out of the box, I thought it was just packing material, and the PlayStation and copies of Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla and Sackboy were way at the bottom. But the longer I looked, the more it dawned on me: The only thing I got was this stupid painting.”

“God, I feel like such a sucker,” he continued, sighing as he gazed back at the mid-century masterpiece of abstract expressionism.



Boy, we’ve heard some horror stories out there about gamers being duped in their quest for next-gen glory, but it’s still painful imagining Friedman’s excitement turning to disappointment as he realized he’d lost over a thousand dollars on this prime example of Rothko’s somber but evocative expressionism. Worse still, the eBay seller has gone cold and isn’t responding to any refund requests, leaving Friedman stuck with this eyesore out back in his dumpster until the junk guys come to haul it away.

So be careful out there, gamers! It might be tempting to fork over money online in the hope of joining the next-generation, but you could wind up with nothing but a painting worth $87 million to compensate you for your effort. That’s something no self-respecting gamer would ever want.",359,2177,21,115

(Just try not to melt into a puddle of gooey nostalgia when Goldfinger’s “Superman” soundtracks your first noseslide). Interestingly, though, developers Vicarious Visions revealed to OGN that the game features one major change: Every character in the game will know that the Iraq War happened.

“Obviously, we wanted to do justice replicating all the amazing details that make the original so beloved, but we also knew we wanted to mix things up by making sure in-game characters like Bob Burnquist, Kareem Campbell, and Tony Hawk are all aware of the United State’s decision to invade Iraq in 2003,” said senior developer Christian Santos, describing the agonizing hours spent to make sure each character model reflects the grim realities of an eight-year invasion with unclear goals that left half a million Iraqis dead. “Officer Dick is back as an unlockable, too. We spent so much time getting the slump in his stance just right to show how—even though he’s ollying and grinding his way through kickass levels such as Roswell—his faith in national institutions has been completely shattered from the sustained campaign of lies about Saddam Hussein’s possession of weapons of mass destruction.”



“You can see it in these characters’ eyes: These are skateboarders living in a world where America’s role on the world stage has become deeply ambiguous,” he continued.

Going on to explain that his team had paid painstaking of recreating fan-favorite levels like New York City, Santos stressed that the remake took liberties only when strictly necessary such as when skaters grind toward the September 11th Memorial and spontaneously shout lines like, “How the hell did this invasion even factor into the War on Terror?” and, “4,424 American soldiers dead—d o Rumsfeld or Rice even care?” and, “S kateboarding just doesn’t feel the same in a post-Iraq War age.”

Welp, color us impressed. We already couldn’t wait to manual our way around some of our favorite skateboarding levels of all time. But it sounds like Vicarious Visions has given this remake just the dash of spice to make us even more intrigued. Rock on, gamers!

1,[2008] Recession-Plagued Nation Demands New Bubble To Invest In,https://www.theonion.com/recession-plagued-nation-demands-new-bubble-to-invest-i-1819569940,"WASHINGTON—A panel of top business leaders testified before Congress about the worsening recession Monday, demanding the government provide Americans with a new irresponsible and largely illusory economic bubble in which to invest.

""What America needs right now is not more talk and long-term strategy, but a concrete way to create more imaginary wealth in the very immediate future,"" said Thomas Jenkins, CFO of the Boston-area Jenkins Financial Group, a bubble-based investment firm. ""We are in a crisis, and that crisis demands an unviable short-term solution.""

A prominent finance expert asks Congress to help Americans rebuild their ficticious dreams.

The current economic woes, brought on by the collapse of the so-called ""housing bubble,"" are considered the worst to hit investors since the equally untenable dot-com bubble burst in 2001. According to investment experts, now that the option of making millions of dollars in a short time with imaginary profits from bad real-estate deals has disappeared, the need for another spontaneous make-believe source of wealth has never been more urgent.

""Perhaps the new bubble could have something to do with watching movies on cell phones,"" said investment banker Greg Carlisle of the New York firm Carlisle, Shaloe & Graves. ""Or, say, medicine, or shipping. Or clouds. The manner of bubble isn't important—just as long as it creates a hugely overvalued market based on nothing more than whimsical fantasy and saddled with the potential for a long-term accrual of debts that will never be paid back, thereby unleashing a ripple effect that will take nearly a decade to correct.""

""The U.S. economy cannot survive on sound investments alone,"" Carlisle added.

Congress is currently considering an emergency economic-stimulus measure, tentatively called the Bubble Act, which would order the Federal Reserve to† begin encouraging massive private investment in some fantastical financial scheme in order to get the nation's false economy back on track.

Current bubbles being considered include the handheld electronics bubble, the undersea-mining-rights bubble, and the decorative office-plant bubble. Additional options include speculative trading in fairy dust—which lobbyists point out has the advantage of being an entirely imaginary commodity to begin with—and a bubble based around a hypothetical, to-be-determined product called ""widgets.""

The most support thus far has gone toward the so-called paper bubble. In this appealing scenario, various privately issued pieces of paper, backed by government tax incentives but entirely worthless, would temporarily be given grossly inflated artificial values and sold to unsuspecting stockholders by greedy and unscrupulous entrepreneurs.

Advertisement

""Little pieces of paper are the next big thing,"" speculator Joanna Nadir, of Falls Church, VA said. ""Just keep telling yourself that. If enough people can be talked into thinking it's legitimate, it will become temporarily true.""

Demand for a new investment bubble began months ago, when the subprime mortgage bubble burst and left the business world without a suitable source of pretend income. But as more and more time has passed with no substitute bubble forthcoming, investors have begun to fear that the worst-case scenario—an outcome known among economists as ""real-world repercussions""—may be inevitable.

""Every American family deserves a false sense of security,"" said Chris Reppto, a risk analyst for Citigroup in New York. ""Once we have a bubble to provide a fragile foundation, we can begin building pyramid scheme on top of pyramid scheme, and before we know it, the financial situation will return to normal.""

Despite the overwhelming support for a new bubble among investors, some in Washington are critical of the idea, calling continued reliance on bubble-based economics a mistake. Regardless of the outcome of this week's congressional hearings, however, one thing will remain certain: The calls for a new bubble are only going to get louder.

But what they want to do, if they can just get it so that people do not trust the U.S. currency, they will benefit tremendously. And so what the Biden administration is doing, it's not really just globally, it's also how much money they're borrowing here in Washington where we're printing money.

Police opened fire after about 2,000 of the protesters began hurling bricks and stones at officers at the construction site of the coal-fired plant in the southeastern city of Chittagong, local police official Azizul Islam told Reuters.

Four protesters died at the scene and another died in hospital, he said.

""We're trying to control the situation,"" Islam said, adding that at least six police officers were among those injured.

The workers attacked and set fire to several structures at the 1,320-megawatt power plant, located 265 km (165 miles) southeast of the capital, Dhaka, he added.

Local government official Saiduzzaman Chowdhury said the workers were protesting over unpaid wages and to press demands for a pay rise and reduced hours during the holy month of Ramadan, which started this week, when Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset.

Several of the injured workers had gunshot wounds and were taken to a hospital in Chittagong, he said, adding that the five people who were killed had all been shot.

The $2.4-billion power plant is a major source of foreign investment into Bangladesh, and one of a series of projects that Beijing is pushing to cultivate closer ties with Dhaka.

In 2016, China's SEPCOIII Electric Power Construction signed a deal with S Alam Group, a Bangladeshi conglomerate responsible for construction work at the site.

During that year, four protesters opposed to its construction were killed when police opened fire during clashes between villagers who were demonstrating both for and against the project.

Signs around the tent embassy emphatically highlight the long-simmering frustrations among a sizable portion of the community here.

Painted in the island’s colours of green and white, one placard reads ‘Du We Giw Up, We Gwen Win’ in the traditional Norf’lk language. The translation: ‘If we don’t give up, we will win’. Another reads ‘Norfolk under Siege’ in English.

In the centre of town on this eight-by-five-kilometre island, a field of green hands - each one hand-painted and signed by a different community member – also serves as a symbolic demand for self-determination.

“If I had to put a percentage on it, I would say 90 per cent of our identity is gone,” says Leah Honeywood, a seventh-generation Norfolk Islander whose lineage traces back to the first permanent settlers on the former penal colony.

With a population of some 1,700 people, Norfolk Island has a rich, unique culture, its own language and a colourful history.

If I had to put a percentage on it, I would say 90 per cent of our identity is gone. - Leah Honeywood, Norfolk Islander

In 1855, Queen Victoria granted Norfolk Island to the Pitcairn Islanders, descendants of the infamous Mutiny on the Bounty. A year later, 163 men, women and children were settled there.

As tears well around her eyes, Leah claims the legacy of her ancestors has been devastated in recent years.

SBS News/Omar Dehen

“They worked so hard and for so long to become a people and a race, and in five years someone has come in and obliterated that.”

“What’s changed is the Australian government has come in here and imposed their governance and their rules, and things like that just don’t apply to Norfolk.”

Island history

Britain transferred Norfolk Island to Australia in 1914, just prior to World War One. In 1979, it became Australia’s first non-mainland territory to be granted limited self-rule. The island quickly instilled its own democratically elected Legislative Assembly, funding its own services, while Australia still retained ultimate sovereignty and final approval of proposed laws.

But the picturesque island, which is crucially reliant on tourism, fell into economic turmoil in the wake of the 2007 Global Financial Crisis. Its chief minister then stunned locals two years later, when he agreed to surrender the island’s self-governing status to Australia for a bailout.

The most controversial decision of all came in 2015 when Canberra ultimately abolished the Legislative Assembly and appointed its own administrator.

The New South Wales Government currently manages services including health, education and policing, in return for federal government funding. Queensland is currently in negotiations to take over when the NSW contract expires.

Since the transfer, Norfolk Island’s 1,000 registered voters have been added to the electorate of Bean in the ACT.

SBS News/Omar Dehen

Ron Ward, a former finance minister on Norfolk Island, says the island was running at an annual deficit of approximately $3 million a year following the GFC. He accuses the Australian government of carrying out “unnecessary … economic warfare against the island”.

“We have no say in anything that is being decided for us.”

“Everything is decided by expat workers and departmental staff in Canberra. It’s a most unsatisfactory way of running a place.”

We have no say in anything that is being decided for us. - Ron Ward, Norfolk Islander

Before Australia stepped in, a non-binding referendum in 2015 saw 68 per cent of islanders vote to keep self-rule.

A ‘Norfolk Island People for Democracy Movement’ has been growing ever since, and, with the support of local elders, took its fight to the United Nations. Since 2016 the movement has appealed to the UN and Human Rights Council to have Norfolk Island added to its list of ‘non-self-governing territories’. A ruling is yet to be handed down.

SBS Food: A culinary journey around Norfolk Island

“Prior to 2016, the island did need something to change. I believe that could have happened through communication with the Australian government,” says Catherine McCoy, an eighth-generation Norfolk Islander.

“I would like to see the Australian government realise that we do have an identity, and I want that back. I would also like the United Nations to step in, so we can determine our future.”

Regional council suspended

But locals have been angered further recently after the Norfolk Island Regional Council, their last local authority, was suspended over the new year by the federal government after an independent audit raised concerns about its financial management.

Questions over the council’s viability are the centre of a public inquiry that began on Norfolk Island this week. But disillusioned islanders claim it is another example of democratic rights being denied.

SBS News/Omar Dehen

“It’s definitely gone too far,” Ms McCoy says. “We have now no voice. We have no elected representation, and I don’t think that’s democratic in any community. I’m just angry about the whole situation.”

Land taxes, which for centuries never existed on the island, is one of the key grievances about Australian rule.

When Queen Victoria granted Norfolk to the Pitcairn Islanders, she also granted each family 50-acre lots. But in recent years Canberra has introduced property taxes.

Ron and Marlene Nobbs, who have been married for 56 years, live on the property of Ron’s ancestors.

SBS News/Omar Dehen

Ron, a former Norfolk Chief Minister, says they can afford the rates, but Marlene, 83, adds that many descendants cannot.

“Norfolk has always been asset rich, but money poor,” Marlene says. “They fear that they are going to lose their land because they can’t afford to pay rates.”

Ron says properties on the island are made up of many portions, which tends to create higher taxes on such cash-poor families.

“In a suburban setting, land rates, property rates, are a very reasonable and workable system for collective revenues to run government services,” he says. “[But] in our situation here, it doesn’t work.”

Opposition not unanimous

Some, though, say life on Norfolk Island is better thanks to Australia. Cherrise Clarke has lived on the island for 40 years and describes the introduction of a social security system as “marvellous”.

“We now have a safety net,” she says. “During the past 12 months, I can’t imagine life without being integrated in the Australian tax system. The support we were given helped the island to survive.”

David Bradbury/Frontline Films

The administrator on Norfolk Island, Eric Hutchinson, admits the transition could have been better managed but says the decision was justified.

“We’re only a very short way through what will be a transition.”

“I’m the last person in the world that wants to see those intrinsic things that make Norfolk Island different to other parts of Australia change if they don’t have to change. But equally, there are things that this community, and I know for a fact, appreciate.”

READ MORE New Caledonians to vote in a third and final independence referendum in the next 18 months

Australia's Assistant Minister for Regional Development and Territories, Nola Marino, who represents Norfolk Island, echoed Mr Hutchinson’s sentiment in a statement.

“The transition … has given Norfolk Islander residents access to Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the Age Pension, child support, infrastructure investment (including $7 million this month for tourism spending to upgrade roads) and a wide range of other benefits,” Ms Marino said.

“Norfolk Islander residents have a strong representation in federal parliament … while electoral laws determine the population of Norfolk Island to be too small to have its own electorate.”

SBS News/Omar Dehen

But for every person who points to reasons why Australian governance is working here on Norfolk Island, there are others who will dispute it, making it a deeply divisive issue in this otherwise tight-knit community.

Leah Honeywood and Catherine McCoy describe Norfolk Island culture as its “soul”. They claim that culture is in danger every time community representation is reduced.

“It is my family, it is my ancestors. They built and paid for this place since 1856 and I want to see that continue,” Ms McCoy says.

It is my family, it is my ancestors. They built and paid for this place since 1856. - Catherine McCoy, Norfolk Islander

Norfolk Island elder Shane McCoy says basic customs are beginning to disappear, including the tradition of waving to other drivers on the road. He claims that is tightly connected to the Australian transfer.

“I can’t say anything against Australia at all. We love Australia. But they’ve got to respect us as well,” he says.

“I just hope common sense prevails.”",1437,8905,17,97

Kobili Traoré killed an Orthodox Jewish woman in 2018 by throwing her off her balcony in Paris.

France's top court ruled on Wednesday that the killer of an elderly Jewish woman will not go on trial, France24 reported.

Kobili Traoré admitted to murdering his neighbor, Sarah Halimi, in 2017. He shouted ""Allahu Akbar,"" or ""God is great"" in Arabic, and ""I killed the devil,"" shortly before throwing her off the balcony of her third-floor Paris apartment, The New York Times said.

On Wednesday, the Court of Cassation - France's final court of appeal - affirmed two prior judgments that ruled that Traoré could not be held criminally responsible for his actions because he was in a state of drug-induced psychosis.

Traoré, a drug dealer, smoked pot every day for 13 years and had up to 15 joints a day, Israel Hayom reported. Toxicological analysis revealed the presence of cannabis in his blood on the day he was arrested, the French newspaper Libération said.

The court noted that ""a person is not criminally responsible if suffering, at the time of the event, from psychic or neuropsychic disturbance that has eliminated all discernment or control,"" The Times said.

Whether the disturbance was brought on through voluntary drug use is not a legally important distinction, the court said.

In December 2019, President Emmanuel Macron made a rare intervention by criticizing the Paris appeals court for saying that Traore was unfit for trial.

""Even if, in the end, the judge decided that there was no criminal responsibility, there is a need for a trial,"" Macron said in 2020.

The country's top magistrates then criticized Macron for impacting the ""independence of the justice system,"" The Times of Israel reported.

The ruling has angered French politicians and France's Jewish community, the largest in Europe.

Dozens of French senators have reacted by proposing a revision to the law that exonerates a crime due to a drug-induced psychosis, The New York Times said.

On Thursday, Marks & Spencer said it had begun legal action against Aldi to “protect” Colin from the discount grocer’s rival chocolate sponge roll Cuthbert which, for a smaller fee, has been masquerading as Colin at birthday parties and on picnics.

With their hard chocolate shells decorated with sweeties and white chocolate grinning faces, it is difficult to tell Colin and Cuthbert apart – until you have had a bite, anyway.

M&S argues the similarities mean consumers think they are of the same standard, enabling its cheaper rival – Cuthbert costs £5 while Colin is £7 – to “ride on the coat-tails” of the company’s reputation for high-quality food.

Colin the Caterpillar made his debut in 1990 and, with more than 15m cake sales under his belt has, like Rihanna, become known to fans by just his first name. He is also known for his philanthropy, thanks to a tie-up with the cancer charity Macmillan.

His fame has led to a number of brand extensions, including his girlfriend (cake) Connie and most recently his branded cake jars, which caused a storm on social media. One wag suggested the pots represented the “rather gross metamorphosis stage between Colin the Caterpillar and Colin the Beautiful Butterfly”.

M&S, which has lodged an intellectual property claim with the high court this week, has three trademarks relating to its caterpillar cake, including the words “Colin the Caterpillar” and the packaging. It wants Aldi to remove Cuthbert from its shelves and agree not to sell anything similar in the future.

There have been a number of similar disputes in recent years, including a 2018 row when Hotel Chocolat accused Waitrose of plagiarism.

It is not the first time copycat claims have been levelled at Aldi. In 2019, the chain delisted its Moo gourmet yoghurt after the cofounder of Collective, Amelia Harvey, claimed the products looked too similar to the brand’s own. It had a similar row with the sausage brand Heck.

In a statement, M&S said: “Love and care goes into every product on our shelves. So we want to protect Colin, Connie and our reputation for freshness, quality, innovation and value.” Aldi declined to comment.

Mark Caddle, a partner at the intellectual property firm, Withers & Rogers, described the case as the “battle of the caterpillars”.

“Colin the Caterpillar has been very popular in the UK market, which could aid M&S’s case,” Caddle said.

“The high court’s decision will rest on whether it thinks Aldi is seeking to benefit commercially by bringing a confusingly similar product to market.”",446,2677,11,70

One doctor at the Albert Schweitzer municipal hospital in Rio de Janeiro told the Associated Press that for days health workers diluted sedatives to make their stock last longer. Once it ran out, nurses and doctors had to begin using neuromuscular blockers and tying patients to their beds, the doctor said.

“You relax the muscles and do the procedure easily, but we don’t have sedation,” said the doctor, who agreed to discuss the sensitive situation only if not quoted by name. “Some try to talk, resist. They’re conscious.”

Lack of required medicines is the latest pandemic problem to befall Brazil, which is experiencing a brutal COVID-19 outbreak that has flooded the nation’s intensive care units. The daily death count is averaging about 3,000, accounting for a quarter of deaths globally and making Brazil the epicenter of the pandemic.

“Intubation kits” include anesthetics, sedatives and other medications used to put severely ill patients on ventilators. The press office of Rio city's health secretariat said in an email that occasional shortages at the Albert Schweitzer facility are due to difficulties obtaining supplies on the global market and that “substitutions are made so that there is no damage to the assistance provided.” It didn't comment on the need to tie patients to beds.

The newspaper O Globo on Thursday reported similar ordeals in several other hospitals in the Rio metropolitan region, with people desperately calling other facilities seeking sedatives for their loved ones.

It’s unclear whether the problem seen in Rio remains an isolated case, but others are sounding the alarm about impending shortages.

Sao Paulo state's health secretary, Jean Carlo Gorinchteyn, said at a news conference Wednesday that the situation was dire in the hospitals of Brazil's most-populous state. On Thursday, more than 640 hospitals were on the verge of collapse, with shortages possible within days, officials said.

“We need the federal government's support,” Gorinchteyn said. “This is not a necessity for Sao Paulo; it is a necessity for the whole country.”

His state's health officials sent nine requests for intubation medication to the Health Ministry over the past 40 days, according to a statement Wednesday. Its last delivery was enough to cover just 6% of monthly needs in the state’s public health network, officials told AP.

Federal Health Minister Marcelo Queiroga, who took over the post last month, said Wednesday that a shipment of sedatives was expected to arrive in Brazil “in the next ten days.” It is the result of a contract signed with the Pan American Health Organization.

He said two separate efforts to acquire medications on the international market are underway “to end this day-to-day struggle.”

For many weeks, the ministry has also been facing logistical constraints on getting oxygen delivered to hospitals across the country. Queiroga said it remains ""a daily concern.″

A more contagious coronavirus variant, known as P.1, has been spreading across Brazil this year. It may also be more aggressive than the original strain, and health workers have reported patients requiring far more oxygen than last year.

The private sector has stepped up to help address some of the supply shortfall. A group of seven large companies donated 3.4 million doses of intubation drugs — enough for the management of 500 beds for six weeks — to the Health Ministry.

A first batch of 2.3 million was scheduled to arrive from China late Thursday at Sao Paulo's international airport and would be distributed to states with critical shortages, the ministry said in an emailed response to AP questions about supply bottlenecks.

Last month, the Health Ministry requisitioned intubation medications from laboratories, reportedly as a means to distribute to the neediest hospitals. That has caused others facilities’ stocks to dwindle, said Edson Rogatti, director of an association of more than 2,000 hospitals nationwide.

“If we run out, the health sector will be in chaos,” Rogatti said on Globo News TV.

Shortages aren’t limited to the public sector. Brazil’s private hospital association published a survey Thursday in which nine of 71 institutions reported having supplies for five days or less. About half said they had enough for a week.

Private facilities are looking to import medications from India, but still need regulatory approval, the association told AP.

The city of Itaiopolis in southern Santa Catarina state this week reported shortages of both sedatives and oxygen. Neighboring Rio Grande do Sul state also reported supplies running out.

“The situation is desperate,” Rio Grande do Sul’s health secretary, Arita Bergmann, said in a statement Thursday. “We urgently need the Health Ministry to replenish hospitals’ stocks, or else intubated patients can wake up without medication, and that would be terrible.”",802,5085,11,85

The number of lives lost, as compiled by Johns Hopkins University, is about equal to the population of Kyiv, Ukraine; Caracas, Venezuela; or metropolitan Lisbon, Portugal. It is bigger than Chicago (2.7 million) and equivalent to Philadelphia and Dallas combined.

And the true number is believed to be significantly higher because of possible government concealment and the many cases overlooked in the early stages of the outbreak that began in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019.

When the world back in January passed the bleak threshold of 2 million deaths, immunization drives had just started in Europe and the United States. Today, they are underway in more than 190 countries, though progress in bringing the virus under control varies widely.

While the campaigns in the U.S. and Britain have hit their stride and people and businesses there are beginning to contemplate life after the pandemic, other places, mostly poorer countries but some rich ones as well, are lagging behind in putting shots in arms and have imposed new lockdowns and other restrictions as virus cases soar.

Worldwide, deaths are on the rise again, running at around 12,000 per day on average, and new cases are climbing too, eclipsing 700,000 a day.

“This is not the situation we want to be in 16 months into a pandemic, where we have proven control measures,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, one of the World Health Organization’s leaders on Covid-19.

In Brazil, where deaths are running at about 3,000 per day, accounting for one-quarter of the lives lost worldwide in recent weeks, the crisis has been likened to a “raging inferno” by one WHO official. A more contagious variant of the virus has been rampaging across the country.

As cases surge, hospitals are running out of critical sedatives. As a result, there have been reports of some doctors diluting what supplies remain and even tying patients to their beds while breathing tubes are pushed down their throats.

The slow vaccine rollout has crushed Brazilians’ pride in their own history of carrying out huge immunization campaigns that were the envy of the developing world.

Taking cues from President Jair Bolsonaro, who has likened the virus to little more than a flu, his Health Ministry for months bet big on a single vaccine, ignoring other producers. When bottlenecks emerged, it was too late to get large quantities in time.

This situation is similarly dire in India, where cases spiked in February after weeks of steady decline, taking authorities by surprise. In a surge driven by variants of the virus, India saw over 180,000 new infections in one 24-hour span during the past week, bringing the total number of cases to over 13.9 million.

The challenges facing India reverberate beyond its borders since the country is the biggest supplier of shots to COVAX, the U.N.-sponsored program to distribute vaccines to poorer parts of the world. Last month, India said it would suspend vaccine exports until the virus’s spread inside the country slows.

Globally, about 87 percent of the 700 million doses dispensed have been given out in rich countries. While 1 in 4 people in wealthy nations have received a vaccine, in poor countries the figure is 1 in more than 500.

In recent days, the U.S. and some European countries put the use of Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine on hold while authorities investigate extremely rare but dangerous blood clots. AstraZeneca’s vaccine has likewise been hit with delays and restrictions because of a clotting scare.

In the U.S., where over 560,000 lives have been lost, accounting for more than 1 in 6 of the world’s Covid-19 deaths, hospitalizations and deaths have dropped, businesses are reopening, and life is beginning to return to something approaching normalcy in several states.

But progress has been patchy, and new hot spots — most notably Michigan — have flared up in recent weeks. Still, deaths in the U.S. are down to about 700 per day on average, plummeting from a mid-January peak of about 3,400.",737,4461,14,87

0,German courts ban 'Querdenker' anti-lockdown demos,https://www.dw.com/en/german-courts-ban-querdenker-anti-lockdown-demos/a-57235905,"Regional German courts have imposed bans on ""Querdenker,"" or ""lateral thinking"" demonstrations that were due to take place this weekend against coronavirus curbs.

Gatherings were planned in both Dresden and the Bavarian city of Kempten this weekend, which prompted legal proceedings and court rulings on Friday evening.

Bavaria's Administrative Court agreed with the local authority that a ban on gatherings by groups of mostly COVID-deniers was necessary to prevent the risk of infection. The Querdenker movement, which opposes Germany's current lockdown measures, initially planned an 8,000-strong demonstration and a subsequent march with 2,000 people.

The founder of the initiative, Michael Ballweg, was also expected to participate in the Kempten protest.

Dresden rally banned too

Meanwhile, the Saxony Higher Administrative Court, which presides over the city of Dresden, said that there was justifiable danger for the participants and passers-by, particularly because of the above-average infection rate and the spread of more infectious virus variants.

Additionally, the court said that limiting the number of participants would not be effective.

The ruling said the organizers would not be able to maintain social distancing and safety measures.

The decision is unappealable and any other planned events are also prohibited.

Dresden also banned a rally by supporters of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which logged 500 participants.

Despite the bans, police are still preparing for some demos to take place anyway.

The Querdenker group has hosted several anti-lockdown rallies in recent months, with one demonstration in Leipzig attracting over 20,000 participants from around the region in November.

Justice minister slams COVID demonstrations

German Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht has called on police to take a hardline against coronavirus demonstrations.

A ""crystal-clear red line must be drawn,"" Lambrecht told the Funke Mediengruppe.

""In addition to criminal prosecution, demonstrations must be broken up by the police,"" she said, calling the behavior of some protesters ""absolutely unacceptable.""

""We cannot expect people to be very restrictive in their private lives while at the same time others are flouting all the rules at coronavirus demonstrations,"" she said.

She referred, among other things, to threats issued against scientists and politicians, and violent attacks on journalists.

In December of last year, Berlin placed parts of the movement under surveillance, after it was deemed to be ""infiltrated by extremists.""

Germany is currently grappling with a third coronavirus wave, and is recording a higher number of daily infections than in past months.

On Saturday, health authorities reported 23,804 new infections and 219 deaths, while the number of new infections per 100,000 inhabitants has risen to 160.7 nationwide.

0,Afghanistan withdrawal will likely dismantle a CIA intelligence network built up over 20 years,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/18/politics/afghanistan-withdrawal-cia-intelligence-network/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Joe Biden's planned withdrawal from Afghanistan includes an intense unraveling of the extensive intelligence and covert action network that the US has built there over the two decades since 9/11 as part of the global war on terror.

The current plan includes the removal of the hundreds of special operations forces not publicly acknowledged by the US government but known to be there, according to two defense officials and a senior US official with direct knowledge of the situation.

Most, if not all, CIA operators working in Afghanistan are almost certain to leave as well, current and former officials told CNN. Without the support of a conventional military presence, on-the-ground intelligence gathering becomes significantly more difficult -- and more dangerous.

Neither the removal of special operations forces nor the likely removal of intelligence operators has been previously reported.

A final decision has not yet been made as to the status of CIA paramilitary officers, one military official told CNN, but the thinking at the moment is that they likely will have to leave. Even if some personnel do remain after Biden's self-imposed September 11 withdrawal deadline, it will be far more challenging to pull off the kind of covert operations the CIA has become famous for since 9/11.

CIA Director Bill Burns admitted as much in a Senate Intelligence Committee public hearing last week

""When the time comes for the US military to withdraw, the US government's ability to collect and act on threats will diminish. That's simply a fact,"" Burns said before noting the CIA will retain ""a suite of capabilities, some of them remaining in place, some of them that we'll generate that can help us to anticipate and contest any rebuilding effort [by al Qaeda or ISIS].""

National security adviser Jake Sullivan acknowledged Sunday that US intelligence gathering capability in Afghanistan would be diminished when troops withdraw from Afghanistan, but said there would be enough capability to know whether al Qaeda is resurging months before it's too late.

""It is true as the CIA director said we won't have the same level of presence on the ground that we did when we had 3,000 troops or 30,000 troops or 100,000 troops,"" Sullivan told CNN's Dana Bash on ""State of the Union.""

""But the CIA director also said we will retain sufficient capability so that we will have months of warning before al Qaeda is able to gather again external plotting capability to threaten the homeland,"" he continued.

Asked whether special operation forces would stay behind, Sullivan said the US would ""not have a military presence in Afghanistan other than to protect the embassy.""

Douglas London, a 34-year veteran of the CIA, said intelligence operations in Afghanistan are dependent on the large military presence the US has kept in the country.

""The US intelligence presence and ability to collect information depends on the military's infrastructure across the country,"" said London.

""As the US presence diminishes, and with it collectors who need to physically acquire intelligence on the ground, so does our visibility,"" he added. ""That human intelligence comes from sources on the ground who can be regularly met. How many can travel to Kabul, let alone outside the country?""

The fate of the special operations forces — who often work with the CIA on counterterrorism missions — is more clear cut.

""It's unequivocal, all troops out,"" the senior US official told CNN, asked specifically about special operations forces.

Counterterrorism is about to get harder in Afghanistan

Intelligence gathered by operatives working on the ground is often critical to covert CIA missions, including drone strikes , multiple sources said.

""With the right information, [you] can launch an operation to kill someone a thousand miles away within two hours. But if you don't have any information, if you don't have any intelligence, how on earth can you predictably do that?"" a source with direct knowledge of internal discussions about the US counterterrorism mission in Afghanistan going forward.

It's unclear how or if the Biden administration will replace the intelligence and counterterrorism tools that senior officials publicly acknowledge they are giving up.

Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill have been clamoring for details, but two sources familiar with the administration's outreach to lawmakers in recent days tell CNN that officials have only gone as far as to say that the US will continue to fight terrorist groups there in the same way it does in other places around the world.

That response has been interpreted by some as continued drone strikes and, in some cases, use of special operations forces, according to one of those sources. The exact details of the plan remain unclear, leaving many lawmakers unsatisfied.

Administration officials are briefing the Senate on Tuesday, according to a Senate aide. House lawmakers expect a similar briefing next week also.

Regional options

Multiple sources told CNN that officials are still exploring ways to mitigate the inevitable intelligence void that comes from withdrawing American troops.

Specifically, US officials are examining the possibility of staging American forces in the region so they will be able to dip into Afghanistan for counterterrorism missions. But current and former officials say there is no way to do that as effectively as when you are in the country.

Maintaining any ""over the horizon"" counterterrorism capability will be very difficult without nearby basing, the US military official added, noting the withdrawal makes those missions ""a very different problem"" than in years past.

The current sense is that the nearby countries of Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan are unlikely to agree to host US forces, meaning the most likely possibilities are friendly Gulf countries, like the United Arab Emirates, where the US already maintains a military presence, according to multiple sources familiar with the planning.

Four F-35A Lightning IIs assigned to the 4th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron taxi after landing at Al Dhafra Air Base, United Arab Emirates, April 15, 2019.

Multiple current and former officials acknowledged that staging assets in a country like the UAE would require CIA paramilitary officers, special operations forces or drones to travel an extremely long distance for any operation in Afghanistan, adding to the risk and complexity of the mission.

""The prospects for direct kinetic counterterrorism pressure from the Gulf, they're not impossible, particularly for strike, but they're just not good,"" a source with direct knowledge of internal deliberations told CNN.

Any attempt by agency paramilitary or intelligence officers to operate outside of Kabul — whether to meet with sources or conduct a counterterrorism raid — would also be dramatically riskier, according to multiple sources.

A more dangerous mission

Because agency personnel won't be able to operate out of a local military base and will instead have to travel from Kabul, or even outside of Afghanistan, they would be forced to travel longer distances to more exposed places that might be in Taliban-controlled areas.

That not only gives potential targets the chance to hear of the impending raid and get away, it also provides adversaries the opportunity to launch a counterattack of their own, with agency personnel far outside of the so-called golden hour from the nearest hospital.

""You have a longer time to get there, so [adversaries] will tell people you're coming,"" said one former intelligence official. ""So even if you have the right place, the chances of the guy not being there go up. And then once you get there, you have to land if you want to catch people, and they're going to rally toward that area. When you fly out it's going to be like the OK Corral.""

""You increase the risk to the force and you increase the risk for the mission to fail,"" this person said.

Further complicating the picture is the risk that the Taliban could overrun the country once the US military leaves, potentially forcing the US to shutter its embassy to avoid another incident like the 2012 attack on the US embassy in Benghazi, which killed four Americans.

That would mean that any remaining agency personnel, who likely would be working out of the US embassy, would have to leave too — thrusting human-source intelligence gathering in Afghanistan back into a pre-9/11 darkness.

""A full US and NATO withdrawal speeds the eventual collapse of the Afghan government and the unviability of the US embassy in Kabul, which then leads us to a pre-9/11 collection posture where we have nothing in the country,"" said Marc Polymeropoulos, a former CIA operations officer.

Biden owns the risk

What those capabilities look like, however, remains unclear and sources tell CNN that previous administrations have wrestled with the same set of bad choices but were unable to identify a viable solution.

President Joe Biden speaks from the White House about the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan on April 14, 2021.

This was the case for Pentagon officials during the Trump administration, according to a source familiar with the situation who noted that the inevitable risks of bringing the number of US forces in Afghanistan to zero are why military and intelligence officials have long pushed for some kind of residual force.

That unavoidable counterterrorism trade-off also comes with a political risk of holding the bag if there's another 9/11-style attack against the US, which current and former officials agree has long been a driving force behind deliberations of this kind in the past.

Biden has ""agreed to take on that risk,"" one source familiar with internal Pentagon discussions about the same issue during the Trump administration told CNN.

The United Nations Security Council is expected to meet Thursday on the situation in Tigray, where thousands of people have been killed and the United States has alleged ethnic cleansing in the western part of the region of 6 million people. The term refers to forcing a population from a region through expulsions and other violence, often including killings and rapes.

Citing several witnesses, Amnesty International said in a statement on Wednesday that Eritrean soldiers passing through the town of Adwa on Monday started shooting “unprovoked” at passers-by, killing at least three people and wounding at least 19.

Six of the wounded were in critical condition, a medical worker at the local referral hospital told the human rights group.

Amnesty’s regional director, Sarah Jackson, called the shooting “yet another unlawful attack by Eritrean troops on civilians in Tigray.”

The spokeswoman for Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, Billene Seyoum, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Abiy last month for the first time acknowledged publicly, after months of denials, that Eritrean soldiers were in Tigray. The United Nations secretary-general once said Abiy had “guaranteed” the Eritreans were not there.

Ethiopia early this month said the Eritrean soldiers had begun to leave.

But witnesses have told The Associated Press that the soldiers roamed freely in parts of Tigray, looting and killing, as they supported Ethiopian security forces and other allied fighters in pursuing the now-fugitive Tigray leaders. Eritrea’s government has long been an enemy of the Tigray leaders.

Deadly fighting continues in several parts of Tigray, as what began as a political dispute between Abiy’s government and the Tigray leaders who once dominated Ethiopia’s government for nearly three decades turned into war.",311,2045,8,59

It came after four years in which President Donald J. Trump repeatedly cast doubt on intelligence findings that Russia was culpable for cyberattacks, poisonings and disinformation campaigns.

It was also the first time the United States government placed the blame for the “SolarWinds” hacking attack, which penetrated American government agencies and corporations, right at the feet of Mr. Putin, saying the operation was masterminded by the S.V.R., one of the Russian foreign intelligence agencies directly under his control. The same intelligence agency conducted the first of two major hackings into the Democratic National Committee six years ago.

In the final days of Mr. Trump’s term in office, an American intelligence assessment concluded simply that the intrusion was most “likely Russian in origin.”

In the weeks leading up to Thursday’s announcement, Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, acknowledged that sanctions alone would not be enough to deter the Russians. He said the response to Russia would include “seen and unseen” actions, and Mr. Biden himself suggested in December that the United States would respond in kind, presumably with cyberoperations of its own.

It may take weeks or months to detect those effects, and some may be visible only to the Russians — though that could undercut the message to other adversaries, including China, Iran and North Korea.

The most significant economic sanction the Biden administration imposed was to stop American financial firms from dealing in newly issued Russian debt, a restriction that goes into effect on June 14 to allow institutions to understand and prepare for the ban, and it is more of a warning shot than a sharp penalty.

0,Analysis: Why is Beijing hounding Jack Ma and Alibaba again?,https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/China-up-close/Analysis-Why-is-Beijing-hounding-Jack-Ma-and-Alibaba-again,"Katsuji Nakazawa is a Tokyo-based senior staff writer and editorial writer at Nikkei. He spent seven years in China as a correspondent and later as China bureau chief. He is the 2014 recipient of the Vaughn-Ueda International Journalist prize for international reporting.

TOKYO -- Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding is in the news again.

On Monday evening, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported that four government agencies had carried out ""joint regulatory talks"" with Alibaba affiliate Ant Group. The four were the People's Bank of China, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange.

One noteworthy aspect is how the questioning was explained.

Xinhua reported that Pan Gongsheng, one of the central bank's deputy governors, answered questions from reporters on behalf of the four departments.

Q: What was the reason financial authorities questioned Ant Group again?

A: The Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central Economic Work Conference and the Ninth Meeting of the Central Finance and Economics Committee clearly stated that it is necessary to strengthen anti-monopoly and prevent the disorderly expansion of capital, and effectively prevent risks.

It was the new slogan that the party has been pushing since October -- curbing market monopolies and preventing the disorderly expansion of capital -- and not existing law that was cited first.

The key point here is that Alibaba founder Jack Ma Yun and Ant Group, which Ma controls, are not under fire for any new mistakes. Instead, it is the party leadership's significant shift that is the cause of the questioning.

Past acts that used to be tolerated no longer are.

The latest question session signals that President Xi Jinping is extending the tactics he used in his signature anti-corruption campaign to private companies.

The need to eliminate corruption had always been talked about in the party. But it was usually just that: talk.

Xi was different because he took a decision made by the party and used it as a banner to more strictly enforce existing rules. With those rules, he cracked down on influential political foes, even those in China's highest echelon.

On Saturday, a long-dormant anti-monopoly law was suddenly and strictly applied in the form of a record $2.8 billion fine on Alibaba, equivalent to 4% of Alibaba's domestic sales in 2019.

Ant, Alibaba's financial arm best known for its smartphone-based Alipay electronic payment service, was forced by regulators to delay its dual listing in Shanghai and Hong Kong in early November, sending shock waves through global markets.

During the talks on Monday, the four regulatory bodies told Ant to transfer all financial operations, including the Alipay service, to a new financial holding company to be set up later and to subject them to strict monitoring and supervision by authorities.

This is the third time in less than six months that Chinese regulators have held regulatory talks with Ant executives.

Ma and Ant executives were first questioned early in November, when Ant's plan to raise more than $34 billion in the world's largest initial public offering was blocked at the last minute.

In December, Ant executives were questioned again. What has been unusual is how public each of the announcements has been.

Alibaba Chairman and CEO Daniel Zhang Yong on Monday rejected the idea that the latest penalty would have a ""material"" negative impact on the company's operations.

But sources suspect some political issues might be involved.

In China, where the party holds all the levers, the act of questioning a company's top executives hints at an unfavorable destiny. Questioned twice, and then a third time?

The $2.8 billion question is why the leadership shifted its stance.

One natural assumption would be the approach of the party's next national congress, in 2022, where Xi is expected to extend his reign.

Thanks to the fierce anti-corruption campaign, now in its eighth year, Xi has cemented his political standing within the party. But he has yet to tighten his grip on the business community.

If Xi were feeling uneasy about the private sector, one trauma could be what happened in Shanghai in the summer of 2015.

A stock market panic sent the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index tumbling 8%. To deal with the emergency, the leadership deployed senior public security officials for price-keeping operations.

A team of investigators led by the then-vice minister for public security (police) entered the building of the China Securities Regulatory Commission in Beijing's financial district and declared a strict joint crackdown on malicious short selling.

The team then flew to Shanghai, China's economic center, and began to investigate individual trading companies and others on suspicion of illegally manipulating stock prices.

The presence of the police signaled that the Xi leadership team detected a whiff of politics behind the whole affair.

That leadership team is now pressing private companies to get off the fence, show the flag and support Xi's political agenda, as it did to party members earlier in the anti-corruption campaign.

Jack Ma has always tried to maintain a certain distance. When he delivered a speech in Shanghai in October, Ma expressed his opposition to financial authorities' policies. He specifically said the country's old financial regulations were a drag on technological innovation.

Ma has had strong connections to China's ""princelings,"" the children of party leaders; ""second-generation reds,"" a smaller group of children whose parents joined the revolution before the 1949 establishment of the People's Republic; and guan er dai, children of government officials.

Xi himself is a second-generation red, being the son of former Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun. Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang, where Alibaba is headquartered, is a scenic city where Xi spent many years as the top provincial official.

But there is clearly a gap between Xi and Ma, partly due to their personal connections.

Alibaba's rapid growth was supported by Chinese leaders before Xi took the helm. Ma had particularly strong connections to the ""Shanghai faction,"" a group of people close to former President Jiang Zemin.

The Shanghai faction is also called the ""machine-building industry faction."" Jiang was originally an engineer for the First Ministry of Machine-Building Industry and at a plant of the FAW Group, a state-owned automaker headquartered in Changchun, Jilin Province.

For years, the Shanghai faction strongly influenced the industrial sphere. But with Xi having rapidly concentrated power, forces that are not close to Xi have had their political influence significantly eroded.

Their economic and financial influence is another matter. Children, grandchildren and other relatives of party elders retain a certain voice, and it is said that people close to princelings have significant Ant shareholdings.

But as Xi aims to extend his reign, he needs to take control of the economic realm, as he has done with the political domain.

Ma sensed the dangerous nature of the Xi era early on and decided to retire from the front line of running Alibaba despite being relatively young. He now appears in public much less frequently than he used to.

There are concerns about Ma's future. ""Even if he is safe now,"" one pundit said, ""there is no guarantee that he will remain so in the future.""

Many influential business leaders have suddenly been sent to prison over the past eight years. Among them is Wu Xiaohui, the top official of Anbang Insurance Group, a private insurer that grew rapidly into the third-biggest player in China.

Wu was detained shortly before the party's national congress in 2017. He was eventually sentenced to 18 years behind bars. Like Ma, Wu is a Zhejiang-born entrepreneur, one who had remarried the granddaughter of former Chinese supreme leader Deng Xiaoping.

As Wu's case clearly shows, connections to princelings or second-generation reds do not necessarily guarantee safety in the Xi era.",1444,9098,10,60

Picture taken with slow shutter speed. REUTERS/Anushree Fadnavis

After gifting and selling tens of millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses abroad, India suddenly finds itself short of shots as new infections surge in the world's second-most populous country.

India breached 200,000 daily infections for the first time on Thursday, and is trying to inoculate more of its population using domestically produced shots.

Facing soaring cases and overflowing hospitals after lockdown restrictions were eased, it also abruptly changed the rules to allow it to fast-track vaccine imports, having earlier rebuffed foreign drugmakers like Pfizer (PFE.N). read more

It will import Russia's Sputnik V vaccine starting this month to cover as many as 125 million people.

The reversal in fortunes could hamper not only India's battle to contain the pandemic, but also vaccination campaigns in more than 60 poorer countries, mainly in Africa, for months.

The COVAX programme, backed by the World Health Organization and Gavi vaccine alliance, aims at equitable vaccine access around the world, and is relying heavily on supplies from India, Asia's pharmaceutical powerhouse.

But so far this month India has only exported around 1.2 million vaccine doses. That compares with 64 million doses shipped abroad between late January and March, according to data from the foreign ministry.

An official with knowledge of India's vaccine strategy said that available shots would be used domestically while the country faced an ""emergency situation"".

""There is no commitment to other countries,"" he said.

India's foreign ministry, which oversees vaccine deals with other countries, said last week that Indian demand would dictate the level of exports.

Resulting shortages are already being felt in some countries in the COVAX scheme, and a U.N. health official involved in the vaccine rollout in Africa said: ""To be so reliant on one manufacturer is a massive concern.""

The director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, said earlier this month delays in supplies from India could be ""catastrophic"". read more

MISSTEPS

Four sources involved in discussions on vaccine supplies and procurement said factors including delays by India and COVAX in placing firm orders, a lack of investment in production, raw material shortages and underestimating the coronavirus surge at home had contributed to vaccine shortages.

The Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's biggest vaccine manufacturer, had vowed to deliver at least 2 billion COVID-19 shots to low and middle-income countries, with nearly half of that by the end of 2021.

But it has also come under pressure to meet the needs of other governments, including Britain, Canada and Saudi Arabia, amid AstraZeneca's global production problems.

The United States, meanwhile, ring-fenced the supply of key equipment and raw materials for its own vaccine makers, limiting SII's operations and delaying by months its goal of raising monthly output to 100 million from up to 70 million now, said one of the sources.

A further initial hurdle to SII's supply ambitions was India's hesitation in placing firm orders, two sources said.

That could have allowed it to boost output of the AstraZeneca vaccine early, even though regulators had yet to approve it.

India spent months discussing the final price per dose, and inked an initial purchase order roughly two weeks after India's drug regulator approved the AstraZeneca shot, according to the sources.

At one point, SII ran out of space to store produced doses.

""That is why I chose not to pack more than 50 million doses, because I knew if I packed more than that, I would have to store it in my house,"" SII Chief Executive Adar Poonawalla told Reuters in January.

He said he had spent 20 billion rupees ($272 million) on the 50 million doses that the company started stockpiling since around October.

Even now, the government only makes ad-hoc purchases from SII instead of agreeing a longer-term supply schedule, said one of the sources.

SII has sought more than $400 million from the government to increase capacity, but no commitment has yet been made.

The health department and foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment on issues of funding, purchasing delays and other aspects of India's vaccination rollout.

COVAX CONUNDRUM

COVAX also did not green-light shipments to participating countries from SII until after the shot received WHO clearance in mid-February, said a source involved in the COVAX initiative.

The source said those delays meant tens of millions of additional doses that the SII could have produced between October and February never materialised.

Gavi defended its decision to wait for proper approvals before going ahead with firm orders. And while it is looking for more suppliers, it conceded that much still depended on India's vaccine makers who account for some 60% of global supplies.

COVAX has a deal to buy 1 billion-plus doses from the SII. But it has received less than a fifth of the 100 million or so doses of the SII-made AstraZeneca vaccine it had expected by May. SII is also supposed to make millions of doses of the Novavax (NVAX.O) shot for COVAX.

Gavi had hoped SII would fully resume vaccine deliveries to COVAX in May, but on Wednesday it said India's COVID-19 crisis could affect that.

""We understand the ferocity of the virus in India at the current time, nevertheless we hope and expect deliveries to resume as soon as possible,"" it said in an email to Reuters.

On Thursday India reported 200,739 infections over the past 24 hours, a seventh daily record in the last eight days, while 1,038 deaths took its toll to 173,123. Its tally of 14.1 million infections is second only to the United States.

Having originally aimed to cover 300 million of its highest-risk people by August, or just over a fifth of its 1.35 billion population, the government has now expanded that by another 100 million, with the promise to widen it further.

0,Chad army claims it has stopped rebel drive toward capital,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/chadian-military-advancing-rebel-column-decimated-77149694,"The Chadian military says it has stopped a rebel advance in the country's north but the rebels are vowing to press ahead

N'DJAMENA, Chad -- The Chadian military said it had halted an advance by rebels coming from neighboring Libya, but the rebel group said Sunday that it was pressing ahead after the American and British embassies warned of a possible assault on the capital in the coming days.

Army spokesman Azim Bermandoa Agouna said that clashes had taken place late Saturday in the northern province of Kanem and that the rebel column from Libya was “totally decimated.”

“Congratulations to our valiant defense and security forces,” government spokesman Cherif Mahamat Zene tweeted, describing the rebel forces as “mercenaries coming from Libya.”

It was not immediately possible to independently corroborate the claims given the remote location where the fighting took place. A warning issued to British citizens, though, said there were believed to be two rebel convoys — one moving from the town of Faya toward the capital, N'Djamena, and another seen headed toward the town of Mao.

The rebel group known as the Front for Change and Concord in Chad issued a statement Sunday on its Facebook page stating that its forces had begun “the liberation of Kanem region.""

“We assure all residents of the city of N'Djamena, including diplomatic staff, United Nations agents, organizations, partners, and expats working in Chad to stay calm and avoid unnecessary travel outside the city of N'Djamena,” said the statement issued by spokesman Kingabe Ogouzeimi de Tabul.

The rebels are believed to have crossed over into Chad a week ago on election day as President Idriss Deby sought to extend his three-decade-long grip on power. While the incumbent was all but certain to win another term, official results have not yet been released.

The U.S. State Department on Saturday ordered non-essential diplomats at the U.S. Embassy in Chad to leave along with the families of American personnel stationed there, saying armed groups appear to be moving on the capital.

“Due to their growing proximity to N’Djamena, and the possibility for violence in the city, non-essential U.S. government employees have been ordered to leave Chad by commercial airline,"" the department said in a travel alert.

The central African nation has had a long history of rebellions during the 30-year reign of Deby. In 2019, French armed forces intervened in northern Chad and launched airstrikes at an armed group coming in from Libya.

In 2008, clashes reached the gate of the presidential palace before Chad’s army repelled rebel forces and pursued them eastward toward the Sudanese border.

Chad, a former French colony, is home to France's military Operation Barkhane, which deploys troops across the continent to fight Islamic extremism. The Chadian military also has played a major role in that effort, contributing troops to the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Mali.

Chadian soldiers also have long battled militants from the extremist group Boko Haram which started in northeastern Nigeria and spread to neighboring countries. Some 330,000 Chadians are internally displaced, the majority in the volatile Lake Chad region where Boko Haram fighters are most active.

Jesus Christ, you don’t even know why, do you?



We just spent four fucking days—four days—trapped inside a rolled-over minivan, and we are deeply frustrated that none of you reported us missing when we didn’t even cover the news about the next-generation Ratchet & Clank.



Sure, it was scary being stuck inside our totaled Honda Odyssey with our wife and daughters after we swerved into a ditch to avoid colliding with an eighteen-wheeler on the highway. Based on the severe injuries we sustained, we actually thought this might be the end of the road. But the whole time, we took solace in our conviction that one of you would alert the authorities when we didn’t post about our excitement for Insomniac Games announcing Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, an upcoming installment in the beloved third-person shooter series for the PlayStation 5.



You didn’t even notice it, though. Come the fuck on, gamers.



Frankly, after having spent decades of our lives delivering you up-to-date commentary on the latest developments in the world of video games, we assumed we had developed a certain type of relationship with our readership. At the very least, we assumed you would realize something was wrong when we didn’t say anything about Ratchet’s ability to hop between dimensions or the new freeze ray effect that takes full advantage of the PS5’s powerful system architecture. It looks like we were wrong, though.



The whole time we were trapped under the badly dented roof, trying to wriggle our paralyzed legs out of the totaled wreckage, we kept telling our wife, Susan, “Don’t worry, the OGN readers will see that we haven’t reported on Rift Apart’s use of real-time ray tracing and come looking for us.” But no, there was nothing. No missing persons report. No attempts to reach out to us. No asking our friends if they’ve seen us. For the entire 96 hours, you didn’t do anything.



And don’t give us any of that bullshit about how you thought we maybe just decided not to issue a comment on it.

That’s the last time we ever expect anything from you, readers. Next time something goes wrong, we know not to count on even the bare minimum of help. Message fucking received.

The latest and biggest has been the giving of passports with fake identities to international crime bosses now dubbed “Mafia”.

The scandal involves the issuing of at least 214 passports with fake identities to foreign criminals and high-risk individuals by the Interior Ministry, some of whom have direct links to the government.

Exposing the depth of the scandal, a video was also released of police cars escorting a Turkish crime lord that received a fake identity passport, while photos on social media show an off duty policeman acting as a bodyguard to the same figure as he walks through the streets in Skopje.

In an interview for the news portal Nezavisen, The President of the Macedonian office of Transparency International, Slagjana Taseva, said the country has now been placed on a “special list” internationally due to the case.

Taseva underscored that the investigation has to confirm the exact amount of passports that have been issued since at least a group of nine individuals within the Ministry began its criminal dealings through a middleman, who is still on the run.

As a result of the affair, the country risks being removed from the visa-free travel regime introduced in December 2009.

VMRO MP Antonijo Miloshoski stated in a briefing that the Government must make an urgent request to the EU General Directorate for internal affairs for an internal revision of the case and the mechanisms in the Interior Ministry by experts from the EU.

According to Miloshoski, this can help Macedonia uphold the visa liberalization decision from the EU.

The affair has exposed the level of corruption within the Interior Ministry and holes in the vetting process of employees, who are typically selected based on ruling party loyalty.

The leader of the opposition, Hristian Mickoski exposed the scandal on Monday night in a televised address. The following day there were raids and arrests on those employed in the ministry.

The government accused the opposition of de-railing the ongoing operation by exposing the corruption before it finished the investigation and threatened Mickoski with sanctions.

Mickovski stated on Thursday night that he was bound by the Law to disclose documents in his possession that are of public interest, as these point to corruption inside a government institution. He also revealed on national television that he has been receiving death threats since exposing the scandal.

0,Spanish firefighter jailed after starting a fire to ‘satisfy his ego’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/16/spanish-firefighter-jailed-after-starting-a-fire-to-satisfy-his-ego,"A volunteer firefighter who sought to “satisfy his ego” by using petrol to start a blaze that devoured 144 hectares of forest and scrubland in northern Spain has been given a three-and-a-half-year prison sentence and ordered to pay more than €158,000 (£137,000) in damages.

Luis Trueba, the former head of the Civil Protection volunteer service in Ramales de la Victoria, Cantabria, had denied deliberately setting the fire in February 2019 so that he could help put it out, insisting instead that he had rushed to the scene “out of instinct”.

But prosecutors argued he had torched the land to “satisfy his ego” and “play a leading role” in extinguishing the fire on its “frontline”.

Cantabria’s provincial court was told that Trueba’s behaviour immediately before the fire was suspicious – as was the fact that he returned to base afterwards “and took a petrol can out of the driver’s side [of his vehicle], which he tried to hide”.

Hours before the fire began, Trueba and a colleague were on a patrol after a fire-risk alert was declared in the area. His co-worker said Trueba had looked at the land and said: “It’s really dry; it just needs someone to take a match to it and see whether they crack out the hydrants.”

A fellow volunteer also told the court the accused liked fires and was like “a junkie after his fix” when it came to finding them.

An investigation was launched after the fire burned through 144.3 hectares (356 acres) of eucalyptus, gorse, bramble, scrubland and pasture in the Sierra de Alcomba on 17 and 18 February 2019.

Although Trueba claimed to have been delivering chairs to a cousin who lived elsewhere, the GPS in his regional government vehicle put him at the scene in the early hours of 17 February.

“Using petrol as an accelerant in the ditch on the left-hand side of the road from Ramales to La Alcomba, he set fire to the land in at least seven different initial points, with a distance of 65 metres between each so that the fire could spread easily,” the court said in its judgment.

It dismissed his alibi as “an “incredible excuse”, adding: “In the court’s opinion, there is ample proof of the crime beyond any reasonable doubt [and the fire] was started directly, intentionally and voluntarily.”

Trueba was found guilty of starting a forest fire of “considerable seriousness”, sentenced to three-and-a-half years’ imprisonment, and ordered to pay a fine of €3,600 and damages of €158,000.

The sentence can be appealed. The court rejected the defence’s offer of €4,000 in compensation, saying the sum would “not even cover a tenth of the costs of extinguishing the fire started by the defendant”, adding that the damages caused exceeded €200,000.

It also frowned on the defence’s suggestion that the defendant had tried to make amends by helping to put out the fire he had set “for his own personal reasons”.

The judgment concluded: “[His participation] was neither effective nor relevant given that bringing the fire under control not only required volunteers – whose role was fundamentally logistical – but also the involvement of four wildlife rangers, three forestry teams, an emergency services crew with four professional firefighters, three pumps, a water supply vehicle, a pickup truck and two amphibious air force planes.”",550,3280,11,69

Moscow (AFP)

Jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny risks cardiac arrest ""any minute"" as his health has rapidly deteriorated, doctors warned Saturday, urging immediate access to Russia's most famous prisoner.

On March 31, President Vladimir Putin's most prominent opponent -- who was imprisoned in February -- went on hunger strike to demand proper medical treatment for back pain and numbness in his legs and hands.

Navalny is serving two and a half years on old embezzlement charges in a penal colony in the town of Pokrov around 100 kilometres (60 miles) east of Moscow.

Navalny's personal doctor Anastasia Vasilyeva and three more doctors, including a cardiologist, have asked prison officials to grant them immediate access.

Their letter to the head of Russia's Federal Prison Service was posted on Vasilyeva's Twitter account on Saturday.

A statement on her Twitter account said his potassium had reached ""critical levels"".

""This means both impaired renal function and that serious heart rhythm problems can happen any minute,"" it added.

Having blood potassium levels higher than 6.0 mmol (millimole) per litre usually requires immediate treatment. Navalny's were at 7.1, the statement said.

In the letter to the prisons chief, the doctors said Navalny, who was critically ill after a poisoning with the Novichok nerve agent, could suffer ""cardiac arrest"".

They said he had to be examined immediately ""taking into account the blood tests and his recent poisoning"".

More than 70 prominent international writers, artists and academics, including Jude Law, Vanessa Redgrave and Benedict Cumberbatch, have called on Putin to ensure that Navalny receives proper treatment immediately.

Their appeal was published late Friday by France's Le Monde newspaper.

Earlier this week, Navalny's wife Yulia, who visited him in the prison colony, said her husband now weighed 76 kilograms (168 pounds) -- down nine kilograms since starting his hunger strike.

On Friday, Russian prosecutors asked a court to designate Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation and the network of his regional offices as ""extremist"" in a move that would outlaw them in Russia and could result in jail time for their members.

Forklift operators will be judged on speed as well as style. These new measures may seem tough, but remember, we don’t want anyone ending up in a slam compilation.” At press time, Frederick added all companies that failed to comply with the new halfpipe requirements would be reported to Red Bull.

His comments were made public Thursday but were taped April 1.

Bourla said it's possible people will need to get vaccinated against the coronavirus annually.

""A likely scenario is that there will be likely a need for a third dose, somewhere between six and 12 months and then from there, there will be an annual revaccination, but all of that needs to be confirmed. And again, the variants will play a key role,"" he told CNBC's Bertha Coombs during an event with CVS Health.

""It is extremely important to suppress the pool of people that can be susceptible to the virus,"" Bourla said.

The comment comes after Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky told CNBC in February that people may need to get vaccinated against Covid-19 annually, just like seasonal flu shots.

Researchers still don't know how long protection against the virus lasts once someone has been fully vaccinated.

Pfizer said earlier this month that its Covid-19 vaccine was more than 91% effective at protecting against the coronavirus and more than 95% effective against severe disease up to six months after the second dose. Moderna's vaccine, which uses technology similar to Pfizer's, was also shown to be highly effective at six months.

Pfizer's data was based on more than 12,000 vaccinated participants. However, researchers say more data is still needed to determine whether protection lasts after six months.",251,1524,12,71

REUTERS/Yara Nardi

Undertakers protested on Friday against a massive backlog of coffins building up at Rome cemeteries, saying city authorities were failing to cope with a surge of coronavirus deaths.

Funeral directors said more than 2,000 bodies were being stored at Rome's sole crematorium, which can handle around 50 cremations a day, while mortuary rooms at other cemeteries were packed, awaiting burial or interment.

Some bodies have been in storage since the start of the year, they said.

""Every few days we are told the cemeteries are blocked and they haven't got any more room to take in the dead,"" said Giovanni Caciolli, head of Italy's federation of funeral workers.

In a statement earlier this week, the city council company that handles burials and cremations, AMA, acknowledged that it was facing an unprecedented situation and was working to create 60,000 new burial plots for the city.

""AMA is doing its utmost to deal with a steadily increasing number of deaths,"" it said.

It said the city had registered 4,763 more deaths between October 2020 and March 2021 than in the same months of 2019/2020, with the rising trend continuing into April.

Italy has reported 116,000 coronavirus-related deaths so far. The majority have been in northern Italy, but in recent months the virus has claimed a growing number of victims in central and southern Italy.

Funeral directors say hearses face lengthy queues at city cemeteries as they await workers to log and store the coffins.

A video obtained by Reuters showed large refrigerated containers parked outside the Prima Porta cemetery. Workers said the containers were being used to hold coffins.

Protesters on Friday laid funeral wreaths in front of the Temple of Hercules, close to Rome city hall.

""Sorry, they don't allow us to bury your loved ones,"" funeral homes wrote on the wreaths.

Earlier this week a local man plastered huge posters across the city apologising to his mother, who died in early March but whose body is still stuck in storage. ""I am sorry mum that I've not been able to have you buried yet,"" the posters say.

Opposition politicians say the crisis could have been averted if the city had heeded warnings in 2017 that it needed to modernise and develop the crematorium.

The Biden administration imposed a raft of new sanctions against Moscow on Thursday over alleged interference in the 2020 election, a colossal cyberattack against U.S. government and corporate networks, illegal annexation and occupation of Crimea, and human rights abuses. ""Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) took sweeping action against 16 entities and 16 individuals who attempted to influence the 2020 U.S. presidential election at the direction of the leadership of the Russian Government,"" the Treasury said in a statement. It also announced sanctions on five individuals and three entities linked to Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula and human rights abuses. In addition to the broad sanctions issued by the Treasury, the State Department announced it will expel 10 officials from Russia's diplomatic mission in the United States. The sanctions come following President Joe Biden's phone call this week with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, and as Russian force amass near the Ukraine border. Washington formally accused Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR — its top spy agency — of being behind the SolarWinds cyberattack publicized late last year, described by Microsoft President Brad Smith as ""the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen."" ""The U.S. Intelligence Community has high confidence in its assessment of attribution,"" the Treasury release said. The attack saw hackers gain access to the software used by thousands of government bureaus and companies. The penalties are also in response to a March report by the U.S. director of national intelligence that concluded Putin authorized attempts to interfere in the 2020 election in former President Donald Trump's favor. The Russian government denies all of the allegations.

Biden also signed an executive order Thursday that allows Washington to sanction any sector of Moscow's economy, significantly broadening the scope of sanctions authority. Under this new authorization, U.S. financial institutions are prohibited from conducting transactions in the primary market for new ruble or non-ruble-denominated bonds issued after June 14. ""When you remove U.S. investors from the primary market, it causes a broader chilling effect,"" said a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ""What you see is that Russia's borrowing costs rise, you see that there's capital flight and you see the currency weakens in tandem. And you know, that has an impact on Russia's growth rate and it has an impact on Russia's inflation rate,"" the official added. ""The President signed this sweeping new authority to confront Russia's continued and growing malign behavior,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement applauding the measure. ""Treasury is leveraging this new authority to impose costs on the Russian government for its unacceptable conduct, including by limiting Russia's ability to finance its activities and by targeting Russia's malicious and disruptive cyber capabilities,"" she added. One of those named in the new actions is Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian agent with ties to former Trump campaign boss Paul Manafort, who was convicted in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election. The FBI is offering $250,000 for information leading to Kilimnik's arrest, who is believed to be in Russia. Moscow prohibits the extradition of a Russian national to any country. Another senior administration official, who declined to be named, said that the White House was still hopeful for a ""stable and predictable relationship"" with Russia. ""We also want to be clear that we have no desire to be in an escalatory cycle with Russia, we intend these responses to be proportionate and tailored to the specific past activities, paths, actions that Russia has taken,"" the official said. The administration officials declined to speculate on possible retaliatory actions Moscow would take on the heels of the sweeping sanctions.

Worsening U.S.-Russia relations

Taking a tougher stance on Russia was one of Biden's foreign policy campaign pledges. The measures announced Thursday join a series of past moves: the Obama administration's debt financing restrictions for major Russian companies like Rosneft, and the Trump administration's ban on U.S. entities buying Russia's foreign currency government loans. ""Today's U.S. sanctions continue the general trend of worsening relations witnessed ever since the annexation of Crimea,"" Maximilian Hess, head of political risk at London-based advisory firm Hawthorn Advisors, told CNBC. ""The key portion"" of these sanctions, he said, ""is the barring of U.S. entities from the primary market for ruble-denominated debts by the Russian government."" However, Hess noted, this ""will not have a major impact, particularly given Russia's manageable debt load."" For Timothy Ash, senior emerging markets strategist at Bluebay Asset Management, the measures are far from harsh. ""It's like guys, come on, you need to do better than this,"" Ash wrote in a note following the announcement. ""Sovereign primary still allows U.S. entities to hold this debt. So U.S. institutions cannot buy Russian sovereign debt in primary issuance, but can get their Russian bank friends to buy it for them in primary, give them a fee, and then buy it in the secondary."" The ruble pared some of its losses Thursday against the greenback shortly after the sanctions news, trading at 76.3025 to the dollar at 4 p.m. local time compared with 77.0718 just before the details of the sanctions were announced.

A doctor at the Albert Schweitzer municipal hospital in Rio de Janeiro said that doctors are resorting to tying patients to their beds in order to ventilate them.

Medics have also been diluting sedative medication to make it last longer and using neuromuscular blockers so patients can't resist, they said on the condition of anonymity.

Brazil has become the epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic, with daily deaths averaging around 3,000 a day and oxygen supplies for intensive care patients at breaking point.

On Thursday, the country reported 3,560 COVID-19 fatalities and 73,174 new cases.

Describing the situation at the hospital in Rio, the doctor said: ""You relax the muscles and do the procedure easily, but we don't have sedation. Some try to talk, resist. They're conscious.""

Brazilian newspaper O Globo reported on Thursday that other hospitals in the Rio metropolitan region were experiencing similar issues, with patients' relatives desperately calling other medical facilities in search of sedatives.

A spokesperson for Rio de Janeiro's health secretariat said ""occasional"" shortages at the Albert Schweitzer hospital are being caused by difficulties obtaining supplies on the global market.

They said that ""substitutions are made so that there is no damage to the assistance provided"" to patients.

The spokesperson did not comment on claims patients are being tied to their beds.

In Sao Paulo, state health secretary Jean Carlo Gorinchteyn said at a news briefing on Wednesday that 640 hospitals there were on the verge of collapse.

He said medicine shortages are possible within days and the need for medical supplies is urgent.

""This is not a necessity for Sao Paulo; it is a necessity for the whole country,"" he told reporters.

Nine requests for intubation medication have been made by his health ministry over the past 40 days, he added.

The last delivery of supplies only covered 6% of what was needed that month in Sao Paulo, state officials said.

Federal health minister Marcelo Queiroga said on Wednesday that a shipment of sedatives was due to arrive within the next 10 days following a deal with the Pan American Health Organisation.

An order of 3.4 million doses of intubation drugs - enough to treat 500 patients for six weeks - has also been ordered from private sector firms, officials added.

The first batch of 2.3 million doses was due to arrive in Brazil from China on Thursday.

DCCC536 / 2020 / Statement of Margaret Ng Ngoi Yee (D3)

Your honour, I am grateful to your honour for allowing me to make this statement about my background and the personal conviction I have held in what I did. I was called to the bar in 1988, but my early training was not in law. I had indulgent parents who allowed me to spend 10 years in the university in Hong Kong and then in Boston to study philosophy. There I learned about rigorous intellectual honesty in the pursuit of truth and alleviation of the suffering of mankind.

It was a sharp change for me to switch to law in 1981 when I went to Cambridge to read for a law degree. Those were the crucial years of Sino British negotiations over the future of Hong Kong. My generation were embroiled in finding a way to preserve Hong Kong’s freedoms and original way of life after the change of sovereignty. This was so important to all of us that, after I was called to the bar, I did not immediately start to practise, but took up an editorial post in the Ming Pao Daily News, because I accepted that it was critical to Hong Kong’s future to have a strong free press, and at that stage I had some standing as a political commentator.

I resumed my legal career in 1990, but in 1995 I was persuaded to stand for election in the legal functional constituency. Your honour, the legal profession, steeped in the common law tradition of civil liberty, did not believe in unequal elections, but they considered that so long as there was such a seat, they would not allow anyone to compromise the rule of law in their name. So I was elected as their representative to hold that office in trust for the people of Hong Kong, to use it to uphold the system under which their rights and freedoms are protected by law. I was charged with a dual mission: to do my utmost to prevent legislation that would harm the rule of law, and to safeguard the institutions that underpin the rule of law. At the top of the list was judicial independence, and the administration of justice.

Those were the tasks to which I had voluntarily pledged to carry out. It meant, first of all, working conscientiously in LegCo’s committees. I served in LegCo for 18 years (including the year from July 1997 to August 1998 when I was without a seat), and for 17 of those years I sat as Chairman of the Panel of Administration of Justice and Legal Services which had oversight of policies concerning the Judiciary, judicial provisions and establishment, including the allocation of land and costs for court buildings, legal policies, legal aid, the organisation of the legal profession, legal services, and legal education. Numerous issues were brought up, discussed and resolved.

Some of the work required search for novel dispute resolution. At the height of the heated dispute within the profession over higher rights of audience for solicitors, I put the matter before the Chief Justice and respectfully asked him to intervene so that the matter may be resolved, and seen by all to be resolved, on the public interest and not by unseemly turf fight. It was vital for the rule of law that the public continued to have confidence in the legal profession.

The expansion of legal aid’s supplementary scheme, assistance for unrepresented litigants, more user-friendly and helpful free community legal advice were among other examples for which extra effort had to be made to find solutions. Often there were setbacks. In 2002, when Audrey Eu SC was also in LegCo, we worked in partnership with NGOs on a proposal for a community legal services centre, to give people timely and useful legal advice. Although it was rejected by the government at the time, in due course the idea bore fruit elsewhere.

I had found that, frequently, tact, diligence and patience were what was needed. But at other times, when a fundamental value was violated, strong statements and response were required. In June 1999, in the wake of the Court of Final Appeal’s landmark decision on the right of abode in Ng Ka Ling, the NPCSC issued its first interpretation of the Basic Law to overturn the court’s decision. This shook the world’s faith in the power of final adjudication of the court. In protest, on 30 June, I and over 600 members of the legal profession went on a silent march, and stood in quiet respect and in solidarity in front of the CFA building then on Battery Path, to mark our unswerving support for the court in that critical hour, so that the community may not be demoralized.

Your honour, the task in the defence of the rule law also meant commitment to the process of law-making. I devoted a great deal of my time to vetting bills. It is recorded that I had worked in 155 bills committees. It is vital to the rule of law that the laws passed by the legislature are sound, rights-based, and measure up to the highest standards. For, judges are bound to apply the law as it is not as what they would wish it to be. Lawyers are in a better position than most to know how a piece of legislation would work – or would not work – when it comes to be tested in the courts. In this I worked closely with the profession to whom I will always be grateful. We did our best to see to it that rights were not inadvertently or unnecessarily compromised. The law should give protection to rights, not take them away, especially in Hong Kong, where structural democracy is still absent. The people relied on the law to protect them, and the courts are the ultimate arbiter of the law. We are mindful that when the court applies a law which takes away fundamental rights, the confidence in the courts and judicial independence is shaken, even though the fault lies in the law, not with the judge who applies it, and that would strike at the foundation of our rule of law.

Your honour, the importance of that duty was driven home to me by the words of a distinguished judge – Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy of the United States Supreme Court as he then was – when he came to Hong Kong at the invitation of the then Chief Justice Andrew Li to give a speech to the Judiciary and the legal profession on 8 February, 1999. He was deeply moved by the challenges lying ahead of us, and the important role of an independent Judiciary. He submitted: “One requisite for judicial independence is that judges have the jurisdiction, the right, and the official capacity to decide all matters, susceptible to judicial resolution, that are necessary to ensure liberty and human freedom. If a judiciary does not have jurisdiction to this extent, then the members of the bar and the members of the larger society must continue to press to expand the jurisdiction. This is vital, because if the bar and the society seem indifferent to a too-narrow judicial charter, there is a risk that the judiciary will in fact or perception aid and abet a larger scheme to deprive persons of their liberty.”

Those were strong words, your honour, but I recognized their authority, and I had ever taken them as marking the ultimate loyalty a barrister owes to judicial independence. Your honour knows that there is no disrespect, to say that the defence of judicial independence is not for the benefit of judges themselves, but so that they can be in a position fearlessly to uphold the rule of law.

The defence of the rule of law is a two-way street. I believed that the representative of the profession in LegCo has a duty also to listen, to consult and explain the law to the community: to alert people to their rights and obligations, to clarify what is obscure, to reduce bewilderment, to invite them to voice their concerns and point out errors, to address those concerns with sincerity, and represent them forcefully to the government; and where their needs cannot be addressed through the law, to work with them towards other solutions

One of the ways for me to keep in touch with the public was by writing articles to the local press, in plain language accessible to the general reader. For everyone ought to understand the law under which he lives. Throughout those years, and even up to now, I have never abandoned that exercise. Less frequently, I publish academic articles and contributions to academic forums, particularly on matters in need of law reform.

Your honour, working with the government in LegCo had impressed upon me, that the rule of law is not just about the law, but equally about governance. For laws are made for the “peace, order and good governance of Hong Kong”. Laws that protect rights tend to win the people’s trust in their government, and trust facilitates good governance. So elected representatives have the duty to speak up to the government of the day: to advise and counsel, to admonish and to warn, constantly: do our laws take rights seriously? The law is not perfect and lawyers know more than anyone else how imperfect the law is. So why should people respect and obey the law? There are, of course, many answers, but the answer I gave myself is this: we can ask people to obey the law if it is the best approximation to justice. Which implies that we are duty bound to listen to criticisms of the law, and make sincere efforts to make the law better, and correct mistakes as much as possible. Justice is the soul of the law without which the rule of law descends to the level of rule by force, even if it is force by majority.

In the course of this trial, your honour’s attention was drawn to a debate on the POO in LegCo on 21 December 2000. In that debate, I pointed out the defects existing in its provisions. They were defects which had long troubled the legal profession. I warned the government that we must seriously consider reform if we were to avoid the law being disobeyed in desperation. Someone in a panel discussion had raised the issue of civil disobedience and the Secretary for Security had called it a threat. But it need not be taken as a threat, but should act as warning or reminder. I urged the government not to shut out rational discussion for reform, because by its recalcitrance, the government was in danger of creating the very conditions which made civil disobedience inevitable and justifiable: something which none of us wished to see.

Those years in LegCo had repercussions for me for life because your honour, defending the rule of law means we ourselves must take rights seriously, and that is a lifelong endeavour.

There is no right so precious to the people of Hong Kong as the freedom of expression and the freedom of peaceful assembly. Not only is the freedom to speak the truth the core of human dignity, it is also the last safety valve in a democratic society, as remarked by our illustrious judges repeatedly. Respecting those rights is also part and parcel of defending the rule of law.

I had learned that the rule of law not only has to be defended in court, or in LegCo, but also in the streets and in the community. Your honour, I had spoken countless times in LegCo. But I also realize that it is not good enough for me to make speeches in beautiful words and measured dignity in the precincts of the Legislative Council, shielded by the privilege of absolute freedom of speech and debate, and immunity from legal action. When the people, in the last resort, had to give collective expression to their anguish and urge the government to respond, protected only by their expectation that the government will respect their rights, I must be prepared to stand with them, stand by them and stand up for them. Otherwise, all my pledges and promises would be just empty words.

Your honour, the Hong Kong people is a peace-loving and well-disciplined people. Their resolute self-restraint even in highly emotional situations has been proved time and again. In the critical hours of the handover between 30 June and 1 July 1997, the great event passed without a hitch. In the march of half a million on 1 July 2003, not a single pane of glass was broken. Even in 2019, when over 1 million marched on 9 June, and over 2 million marched on 16 June. The peace and good order of the massive crowds astonished and won the admiration of the world.

And in the incident of the present trial, this was demonstrated again. By the estimation of the organizers, over 1.7 million participated in the day’s event. But whatever the exact figure, the huge and dense crowds in and around the venue, the resolute patience with which the crowds waited in the pouring rain, were captured in undisputed footages preserved for all posterity. The number and the perseverance spoke volumes for the intensity of the feelings in the community, and yet the self-restraint was for all to see. It is not disputed even by the prosecution that the event was entirely peaceful and orderly, without any untoward event. The crowd had kept faith with the organizers who enjoined them to be ” peaceful, rational and non-violent”. At such times we cannot be seen to abandon the people but must stand side by side with them, in the hope that peace may prevail.

The positive effect of the peacefulness of that demonstration was acknowledged by the CE, Mrs Carrie Lam 2 days later, remarking that it would facilitate dialogue between government and the public. In the event, the dialogue on that occasion did not continue for long, but it was a step in the right direction. I believe we should nurture hope, and continue, as Justice Kennedy urged upon the legal profession gathered together in that distinguished company : You must speak reason to your litigants. You must speak justice to society. You must speak truth to power.

Your honour, I came late to the law. I have grown old in the service of the rule of law. I understand Sir Thomas More is the patron saint of the legal profession. He was tried for treason because he would not bend the law to the King’s will. His famous last words were well authenticated. I beg to slightly adapt and adopt them: I stand the law’s good servant but the people’s first. For the law must serve the people, not the people the law.

Your honour, please permit me to thank my counsel. Their tireless dedication and excellence have made me proud to be a member of the bar.

This is my statement. Thank you, your honour.

0,"Top official says asking China to do more on climate is ""not very realistic""",https://www.axios.com/china-climate-change-226c9e50-243e-44e6-a4bf-e1fb1522bb19.html,"China's Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Le Yucheng told AP on Friday that China is unlikely to pursue climate proposals beyond its current arsenal, calling it ""not very realistic"" for a country of 1.4 billion people.

Why it matters: Despite heightened geopolitical tensions, the Biden administration has emphasized the need to partner with China on climate change. Le's comments come as Biden's climate envoy John Kerry is discussing the issue in meetings with Chinese officials in Shanghai.

What they're saying: ""Some countries are asking China to do more on climate change. I am afraid this is not very realistic,"" Le told AP.

But China plans to send a ""positive message"" at President Biden's virtual climate change summit on April 22–23, Le added. He did not say whether Chinese President Xi Jinping plans to attend, but said, “the Chinese side is actively studying the matter.”

Le said that U.S. policy on China is ""too negative"" and needs to prioritize collaboration over competition. It can't be one ""side drawing up a laundry list or demands to the other side,"" he said.

The big picture: China is currently the world’s biggest emitter of planet-warming carbon dioxide, with the U.S. in the No. 2 spot — though the U.S. leads in historical emissions.

China aims to peak its emissions by 2030 and reach carbon neutrality by 2060, but the U.S. and other nations are pushing for them to set more stringent near-term targets.

These latest comments illustrate how much U.S. credibility on this issue was eroded when former President Trump withdrew from the Paris climate agreement, which the U.S. negotiated with the help of China.

What to watch: At next week's summit, the U.S. is expected to announce more ambitious targets for reducing carbon emissions and pledge aid for less wealthy nations' climate efforts, AP reports.",302,1835,14,76
0,Hong Kong pro-democracy figures given jail terms of up to 18 months,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/16/jimmy-lai-martin-lee-hong-kong-pro-democracy-figures-sentenced?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other,"A court in Hong Kong has handed down a mixture of prison and suspended sentences to 10 of the territory’s most prominent pro-democracy figures, including reformers, politicians and a media mogul, some veterans of the transition from British rule in the 1990s.

The prison sentences for organising or participating in an unauthorised assembly – traditionally a low-level offence attracting fines – are a highly symbolic blow to the pro-democracy movement, which has been targeted by authorities bent on removing all opposition to Beijing.

Those sentenced included Jimmy Lai, a 72-year-old billionaire media mogul and democracy activist, and veteran labour leader and outspoken organiser Lee Cheuk-yan, 64. Fellow defendant Martin Lee, 82, known as the father of democracy, had never faced trial until this year. Nor had Margaret Ng, 73, a former legislator and highly respected lawyer who in a powerful speech on Friday told the court the law was supposed to protect the people’s rights.

The sentences related to two rallies held in August 2019. Lai and Lee Cheuk-yan were each sentenced to 14 months in jail. The activist “Long Hair” Leung Kwok-hung received the longest sentence, of 18 months. Martin Lee and Margaret Ng were given 11 and 12 months respectively, but both sentences were suspended for two years.

The former Democratic party chairman Yeung Sum, 73, was given a suspended sentence of eight months.

Outside court, the 69-year-old lawyer Albert Ho, who was given a 12-month sentence suspended for two years, said the sentences were “shocking and totally unthinkable”. He said the judge treated any act of assembly without police approval as “disruption to the social order”. Ordinarily such convictions would only attract a fine, Ho said, but instead the judge set sentences at 18 months before reductions.

Asked how he felt about the verdict, Martin Lee said only that he was going home for a rest.

Lai, who is facing other charges including under a draconian national security law imposed by Beijing last year, has been detained on remand since late last year.

Prosecutors laid a further national security charge against Lai on Friday, accusing him of conspiracy to collude with foreign forces, and another criminal charge of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Both reportedly relate to the case of Andy Li, an activist who was caught by Chinese authorities attempting to flee Hong Kong for Taiwan by boat.

Lai’s repeated arrests and related raid of his newsrooms have drawn international condemnation. Lee is also facing a number of other protest-related cases this year, and had previously told the Guardian he expected to be jailed.

During mitigation, Ng told the court that laws should “give protection to rights, not take them away, especially in Hong Kong where structural democracy is absent”.

Ng said there was “no right so precious to the people of Hong Kong as the freedom of expression and the freedom of peaceful assembly”.

Dozens of people queued to enter the West Kowloon court on Friday morning, including foreign diplomats and former Hong Kong legislators.

Outside the court the defendants held up their hands to signal “five demands, not one less”, the rallying cry of the movement. Lee Cheuk-yan urged Hong Kong people to “hold on”.

“I’m ready to face the penalty and sentencing and I’m proud that I can walk with the people of Hong Kong for this democracy,” he said. “We will walk together even in darkness.”

Prosecutors had accused the individuals of organising or participating in unauthorised assemblies on two dates in August 2019, at the height of the mass pro-democracy protests that brought the city to a standstill.

Entering his plea, Lee Cheuk-yan told the court the group had done nothing wrong, and “history would absolve us”.

The prison sentences were quickly condemned. “The prosecutions, convictions and heavy custodial sentences of these dignified and experienced democrats, for their peaceful role in a protest sends a chilling message to Hong Kong citizens that free expression and peaceful protest may result in prison sentences,” said Schona Jolly QC, the chair of the Bar Human Rights Committee of England and Wales.

Amnesty International’s Asia-Pacific regional director, Yamini Mishra, said the convictions were against international law. “The wrongful prosecution, conviction and sentencing of these activists underlines the Hong Kong government’s intention to eliminate all political opposition in the city,” Mishra said.

Chris Patten, a former British governor of Hong Kong, said the cases saw “some of the most distinguished of the city’s peaceful and moderate champions of liberty and democracy placed in Beijing’s vengeful sights”.

“The CCP [Chinese Communist party] simply does not understand that you cannot bludgeon and incarcerate people into loving a totalitarian and corrupt regime,” he said.

More than 10,200 people have been arrested in relation to the mass protests of 2019, which began as opposition to a proposed bill allowing extradition to China but evolved into broader pro-democracy movement. There were frequent violent confrontations between protesters and police, who were accused of brutality.

A subsequent crackdown by authorities, using existing criminal laws, the national security law introduced by Beijing in 2020, and anti-pandemic laws have ended mass protests, and more than 100 people have been arrested under suspicion of national security offences, including much of the opposition camp.

This week the government gazetted amendment bills to overhaul the election system, introducing police vetting for candidates, outlawing calls to boycott the vote, and limiting the number of seats opposition candidates could feasibly hold.",946,6042,12,67

Rome celebrates its 2,774th birthday on 21 April 2021. Known as Natale di Roma, the annual birthday celebration is based on the legendary founding of Rome by Romulus in 753 BC.

Traditionally the celebrations include historical re-enactments such as costumed parades and gladiator fights however in 2021, for the second year in a row, events will be moved online due to Italy's covid-19 restrictions.

Events are usually centred in the Circus Maximus and include gladiator fights and the trench-digging ritual, known as the tracciato del solco, which recalls the founding of ancient Roman towns when a trench or mundus was dug and offerings thrown into it to encourage the gods to watch over the inhabitants.

Other re-enactments include the agricultural Palilia ceremony. Dating back to before the founding of Rome, the ceremony was held in honour of the goddess Pales, protector of flocks and herds, and involved vestal virgins distributing straw and the ashes and blood of sacrificed animals before jumping over a bonfire three times.

The highlight of the Natale di Roma festivites, the grand parade, usually includes more than 1,500 costumed participants processing to and from the Circus Maximus, via the Colosseum.

The pageant is organised by the Gruppo Storico Romano, an historical dramatic society which, for more than 20 years, has brought history to life by re-enacting battles, historic events, and displays of ancient theatre and dance in the city centre.

Under the slogan ""We won't give up,"" this year the group's re-enactments will be streamed on Sunday 18 April from Italy's National Etruscan Museum at Villa Giulia.

The online programme of events, dedicated to Emperor Nero, will begin at 14.00 and conclude with gladiator fights live from Villa Giulia.

The historical re-enactments can be watched via the Gruppo Storico Romano Facebook page.

Last year the city of Rome also organised some online events to mark Natale di Roma. We will update this article accordingly if and when there is news on that front.",350,2186,6,40

While I still certainly have a lot to learn, hopefully by opening up my heart to these hate-fuelled, unhinged rants, I can finally help these communities heal.” At press time, Zuckerberg posted a list of helpful resources he’d used to educate himself, designating Identity Evropa and Stormfront as “required listening.”

0,The Nation’s Corn Belt Has Lost a Third of Its Topsoil,https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/scientists-say-nations-corn-belt-has-lost-third-its-topsoil-180977485/,"Seth Watkins has been farming his family’s land in southern Iowa for decades, growing pasture for his cows as well as corn and other row crops. His great-grandfather founded the farm in 1848. “He came in with one of John Deere’s steel plows and pierced the prairie,” Watkins recounted. With its rolling hills and neat lines of corn stretching to the horizon, broken by clumps of trees, it’s a picturesque scene.

But centuries of farming those hills have taken their toll on the soil. Now, farmers like Watkins are facing widespread soil degradation that can lower their crop yields and incomes. “In 150 years or so, we’ve lost over half of that rich topsoil—if not all in some places.”

Crops hunger for the carbon-packed composition of rich topsoil. They need the nutrients and water that it stores, unlike the compacted, infertile soils that decades of conventional farming create.

The baseline for soil in Iowa is visible on land owned by Jon Judson, a sustainable farmer and conservation advocate. His farm hosts a rare plot of original prairie grasses and wildflowers. Under the prairie, the soil is thick and dark, with feet of organic matter built up and plenty of moisture. The next field over is a recovering conventional field like Watkins’ farm, and the effect of years of conventional practices is obvious. The soil is pale and compacted, with only a few inches of organic carbon, much less soil moisture, and a lot more clay.

Scientists and farmers know that agricultural soil erosion has been a problem for decades, but quantifying soil loss from a hundred years of farming and across multiple states has proven difficult. Now a study led by geomorphologist Evan Thaler and published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in February attempts to answer the elusive question of how much topsoil has been eroded in the Corn Belt, which stretches roughly from Ohio to Nebraska and produces 75 percent of the nation’s corn. The study estimated that about 35 percent of the region has lost its topsoil completely, leaving carbon-poor lower soil layers to do the work of supporting crops. Having thick, healthy topsoil means plants can grow faster and healthier, increasing crop yields and keeping the field’s ecosystem running smoothly. Topsoil loss creates environmental problems, such as when eroded, nutrient-laden dirt degrades streams and rivers, and is estimated to cost the Midwest’s agricultural industry almost $3 billion annually.

“I think it’s probably an underestimate,” says Thaler, a graduate student at the University of Massachusetts–Amherst. “There are areas where there’s probably a centimeter of topsoil left.”

Thaler and colleagues used soil color from satellite imagery to track which areas of Corn Belt fields were lighter or darker. Darker soils have more organic carbon, which is a good indicator that the topsoil is present. Further down in soil, less organic carbon builds up, so once those layers are exposed, the surface looks lighter. Thaler then connected a color map he created to high-resolution topographic data, which told him where slopes were steep and whether hilltops were curved in or out. When he compared soil color to hills’ shapes, the map confirmed what he and countless farmers have noticed: the tops of hills are light, and their bases are dark. Plowing and precipitation lead rich topsoil to slowly creep downhill, leaving thin, carbon-poor soil uphill. Thaler found that highly curved hilltops are more likely to have eroded topsoil. That relationship drives his general finding of highly eroded soils in the Corn Belt, but it has been missing from erosion research until now.

In 2019 using on-the-ground soil surveys, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimated that none of those same fields had complete topsoil removal. Those determinations were based on small-scale examinations of soil that were assumed to reflect larger areas. But a single sampling site may not accurately reflect topsoil across an entire field: if scientists happened to sample the bottom of a hill, they might underestimate topsoil erosion for the whole field. Another issue, Thaler says, is estimating nationwide erosion. The USDA can’t sample soil from every corner of the country, so it relies on computer models to fill in the gaps. Because the equations those models use don’t take hillslopes into account, like Thaler’s study does, soil erosion is underestimated there, too.

Rick Cruse, an agronomy professor at Iowa State University whose research on soil erosion includes remote sensing and satellite imagery, found Thaler’s results to be reasonable. “The technologies they used have been in the literature and have been developed for decades,” he says. “When I look at the landscape where they’re making these estimates, and look at the economic estimates they’ve generated, I have no pushback on what’s been done here.”

Andrea Basche, an agronomy professor at the University of Nebraska who has used aerial imagery of fields at smaller scales, says the 35 percent estimate may be a little high and that verifying modeling results on the ground by surveying soils in person is important. But she says the study is a unique use of geospatial data to address a difficult problem, and that could help raise the profile of erosion as a pressing environmental issue. “Evidence of soil degradation and erosion from more intensive agriculture is ubiquitous,” she says. “I think the study matters for elevating the conversation around this really critical issue.”

Thaler’s study shows the magnitude of soil erosion, but it is not able to say whether the erosion is due to current farmers’ practices or the long culmination of a field’s agricultural history. The Corn Belt and other agricultural regions in the United States have been heavily farmed for hundreds of years, during which both climate and agricultural methods changed. If a field has been farmed nearly continuously for such a long period of time, it’s difficult to tell whether that topsoil was lost steadily over the last 200 years or in recent spurts of erosion.

“It’s not a critique of the study, but what they did was a snapshot,” says Hannah Birgé, a soil scientist at The Nature Conservancy–Nebraska. “I know Nebraska farmers would say, ‘It probably did happen—we did major soil refining from the 1920s to ’40s. But we don’t do that anymore, so what you’re seeing is old [erosion].’”

The evolution of farming equipment and practices have affected the magnitude of erosion in the U.S. for hundreds of years. Settlers began systemically clearing the Great Plains prairie in the early 1800s as the John Deere plow became a staple of conventional tilling, which is the practice of digging up the topsoil to plant seeds. Later, gas-powered tractors made ripping up fields even easier. Aggressive plowing and monoculture planting led to unprecedented topsoil loss during the Dust Bowl. In 1935, in the wake of staggering soil and economic loss, Congress created the Soil Conservation Service (now known as the Natural Resources Conservation Service) to encourage more sustainable farming. The organization encouraged no-till planting, which conserves topsoil by not churning it up as intensely as conventional tilling, and cover crops, which help hold soil in place and replenish its nutrients, in the mid- to late-1900s. Today, such sustainable practices are beginning to spread as awareness of soil spreads too, but fewer than a quarter of fields nationally are farmed with no-till practices. Soil erosion is a slow, hard-to-spot problem, and financial pressures can keep farmers working fields even if they suspect they shouldn’t.

The slow timelines for erosion and changes in soil health are one reason it can be difficult to motivate farmers to adopt conservation practices. “It's hard not only for farmers, but also for natural resources professionals and policymakers, to address things that change over such a slow period of time,” Birgé says. “The risk is that the feedback will be slow, and then suddenly you have these nonlinear responses. Take, for example, the Dust Bowl. There were decades of slow change, then boom—30 years of mismanagement manifested in disaster.”

For farmers who own, rather than rent, their land, a long-term approach to managing their farm’s ecosystem can be guided and encouraged by federal agencies like the Natural Resources Conservation Service, which helps agricultural landowners work sustainably and efficiently. The Conservation Reserve Program, officially established by the 1985 Farm Bill, pays farmers to stop farming ecologically sensitive land for 10 to 15 years. Birgé says farmers jump at the opportunity, with more people signing up than the program can pay.

“The program has been hugely successful,” she says. “Ten years is a long time in the policy world, but it’s the blink of an eye when you think about soil erosion. It’s transformed the landscape in really important ways. But now it’s at the point where it could use more funding and some improvement.”

Cruse agrees that such economic incentive programs are essential to treating soil erosion.

“It’s really challenging to make things happen because we’re a capitalist society, and people make money by farming,” Cruse says. “There can be a resistance in the farming population to manage fields sustainably. We need a government program that would pay farmers not to farm. We need incentives and regulation.”

A dearth of economic incentives to pursue sustainable farming remains one of the main hurdles in agricultural soil conservation. While programs like the Conservation Reserve Program are successful, they are still limited in scope and funding. Other federal agriculture programs can emphasize income over environment. Crop insurance, which was created to protect farmers against sudden financial ruin if a crop fails, guarantees a set payment for a planted crop—whether or not it’s in at-risk soil that may not be able to support a successful crop.

“Most people want to take care of the land,” says Judson, of modern farmers. “But if implementing conservation changes aren’t going to show a positive benefit to them in the near future, they may be less likely to implement practices because they can’t really see value in it.”

Some farmers, though, are motivated to make a change for the better and adopt a long-term mindset. Without a direct economic incentive, Watkins decided to switch from conventional farming practices to conservation-focused ones, like planting a diverse array of native grasses, beginning in the early 1990s. In the early 2000s, he decided to add cover crops, like clover and alfalfa, which decreased soil erosion and increased his soil quality without relying on fertilizers. Even though he was already practicing no-till farming because of how steep his fields were, “My ‘no-till’ never quite worked until I added cover crops,” he says.

Farming practices that decrease erosion and increase crop yields are good for the environment in other ways. Soils store a huge amount of carbon—more than any other part of an ecosystem on land. Implementing conservation practices like cover crops can lower a farmer’s carbon footprint and reduce reliance on chemical additions to soil. “But they don’t really talk about those things in farmer meetings,” Watkins says. “The main message you get as a farmer is that it’s your job to produce and not to worry about those things.”

“The argument is that we’ve got to feed nine billion people by 2050, and that seems to give me carte blanche to do whatever I want with the land, if I’ll produce corn,” Watkins says. “I think it’s more important to build up a bank of healthy, fertile soil for when our population grows, instead of depleting it now.”

Despite the efforts of farmers like Watkins and Judson, the vast majority of the Corn Belt remains conventionally tilled. Economic incentives and risks, as well as social norms, still push many farmers to focus on yearly yield rather than long-term conservation. And as Watkins and Judson noted, simply changing one practice may not be enough to stop soil erosion. No quick, easy fixes exist to solve the problem. But focusing on the long-term and increasing funding for programs like the Conservation Reserve Program are important places to start.

After adding cover crops, Watkins continued converting his conventional farm into a sustainable practice by planting native prairie grasses and trees to improve the soil and biodiversity. He also began using geospatial data tied to financial predictions to decide which parts of a field to plant. “I started doing those things and not only did they improve my bottom line,” he says, “but I’ve also watched them improve the quality of my soil and wildlife.”

The Castro family has led the party since 1961.

“As I live I will be ready with my foot in the stirrups to defend the fatherland, the revolution and socialism,"" Castro told party delegates at a convention in Havana on Friday.

Also on rt.com Annex Cuba? Left & right unite to bash ‘woke’ neocon imperialist Bill Kristol for advocating US takeover of island nation

Raul has served as First Secretary of the Cuban Communist Party since 2011, when he replaced his late brother, Fidel Castro. Fidel became prime minister (later president) of Cuba following the 1959 revolution, and first secretary of the party two years later.

Raul Castro stepped down from the presidency in 2018, when Miguel Diaz-Canel took over the office, but remained in charge of the party.

Cuba remains one of the last few communist states in existence, despite Raul Castro introducing some limited free market reforms in 2011. The country’s healthcare system and literacy rate rank impressively high compared to some capitalist nations, but consumer goods are hard to come by. A state salary in Cuba is just $20 per month, and there are only 173,000 cars between the country’s 11 million people.

Whichever party loyalist fills Castro’s shoes will have to grapple with a stagnant economy, as well as strained relations with the US. While Donald Trump sanctioned and forbade travel and commerce with the island nation during his term, President Joe Biden has promised to thaw relations with Cuba. However, he has yet to change any of Trump’s policies.

“The narrative of the Afghan government falling apart is a false narrative,” Ghani said.

President Ghani said that Afghan commandos, special forces and air force alone are 40,000 and that “they have trained among the best, they are among the best in the region.”

“As long as this force stays, there is no risk of state collapse,” Ghani reiterated.

He said that all these forces have been brought into one command of the Afghanistan National Authority for Special Operations and that they carry 30 to 40 operations every day.

Ghani mentioned that he is ready to hand over power to his elected successor.

“I have four years of my term left but for the sake of peace, my colleagues and I are willing to hold elections from six months to a year, maximum, so that the will of the people – the key to us is the right of the people to choose their leader and for me to hand over legitimate authority to my successor,” he said.

Ghani said that now is the time for the Taliban to choose whether they will opt for peace or for violence.

“It is a moment of choice for Taliban. Will they opt for a peace that is on the table or will they opt for conquest,” Ghani said.

He said that the announcement of the withdrawal of US and NATO forces withdrawal has also created a moment of choice for Pakistan.

“For Pakistan, it is a decision of destiny. Will it opt for regional cooperation, international partnership, and regional prosperity through joint efforts, or will it give way to the forces that have headered to support and sustain the Taliban and the wave of extremism for which Pakistan next to Afghanistan has probably paid the highest price? So, it is a moment of decision. We will need to watch.”

He added that the Afghan government is committed to talks and that it is now up to the Taliban to act.

“The ball is in the court of the Taliban. We are fully prepared for Istanbul. There is a consensus on this, national and within the government. We will see now whether the Taliban opt,” Ghani said. “The key is that the political committee does not represent, unfortunately, the military committee or the commanders. They (Taliban) have not socialized peace yet, but it’s a jolt that they need to absorb because they could not think that the United States will withdraw.”

He said that the Biden administration’s decision to withdraw forces from Afghanistan ""is no surprise"" for him.

Ghani added that the decision “clarifies a lot of things and it allows us to move forward so the right decision will have the consequences of making Taliban think seriously.”

“If they (Taliban) engage in war, they would have lost a golden opportunity and I hope that they don’t do that,” he stated.

0,Nearly 100 Injured After Train Derails In Egypt,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/nearly-100-injured-after-train-derails-in-egypt-2416509,"Egypt's cabinet said in a statement that four carriages of the train heading came off the tracks

A train accident north of Cairo on Sunday left 11 people dead and 98 others injured, Egypt's health ministry said, in the latest rail calamity to hit the North African country.

The ministry, in an updated toll, said that ""11 people were killed and 98 others injured in a train accident in Toukh"", a small farming town in the fertile Nile Delta about 40 kilometres (25 miles) outside the capital.

Egypt's cabinet said in a statement that four carriages of the train heading from Cairo to Mansoura, a Delta city, came off the tracks.

Dozens of ambulances were dispatched to the site, the health ministry added, and investigators have been sent to determine the accident's cause.

President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi tasked the military's engineering authority on Sunday with investigating the latest incident, which came on the heels of a deadly train crash last month that left at least 20 people dead.

Authorities have not yet provided a reason for Sunday's derailment.

A security source told AFP the driver and other rail officials had been detained for questioning.

The ministry said 14 people who sustained minor injuries were released from a hospital close to the accident site.

Egyptian rail disasters are generally attributed to poor infrastructure and maintenance.

At least 20 people died and 199 were injured last month in a train crash in the country's south, according to the latest official toll, which authorities have revised several times.

The prosecution has alleged that the driver of one train and his assistant had both left the driver's cabin when it crashed into another train.

Transport Minister Kamel el-Wazir -- a former general named to the post after a deadly 2019 train collision -- blamed the March crash on human error.

""We have a problem with the human element,"" he told a TV talk show, where he pledged to put in place an automated network by 2024.

The African Development Bank announced earlier this month a $170 million loan to improve safety on Egypt's rail network.

The bank said the money would be used ""to enhance operational safety and to increase network capacity on national rail lines"".

""The planned upgrades are expected to benefit low-income Egyptians, about 40 percent of the population, who rely on trains as an affordable mode of transport,"" it said in a statement.

One of the country's deadliest train crashes came in 2002, when 373 people died as a fire ripped through a crowded train south of Cairo.

India has reported a record daily increase of 217,353 COVID-19 infections over the last 24 hours, health ministry data showed – the eighth record daily increase in the last nine days.

Deaths from COVID-19 rose by 1,185 – the highest single-day rise in seven months – to reach a total of 174,308, the health ministry’s data showed on Friday.

With a total tally of nearly 14.3 million, India this week overtook Brazil to become the country with the second-highest number of cases worldwide after the United States.

India’s daily coronavirus caseload has doubled in 10 days, as authorities grapple with shortages of vaccines, treatments and hospital beds.

The Indian government said on Friday it will supply 17,092 MT of medical oxygen in a dozen states where the virus is surging, including Maharashtra and capital city of Delhi.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked state to source medical oxygen from industrial plants, as supplies across the country have fallen short of meeting a demand surge due to a record-increase in COVID-19 infections.

Vicious second wave

Having let its guard down with mass religious festivals, political rallies and crowds at cricket matches, India is experiencing a vicious second wave, recording almost two million fresh infections this month alone and forcing new restrictions in Mumbai, New Delhi and other cities.

Experts have raised concerns about the spread of more contagious and deadlier variants of the disease, particularly given widespread participation in religious festivals and political rallies.

A Lancet study this month estimated that India’s fatalities could double by June.

“The biggest fight we have is in the society … Over a period of time, people have adopted a casual approach,” Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said at New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences on Friday.

People bury the bodies of victims who died due to the coronavirus disease at a graveyard in New Delhi [Danish Siddiqui/Reuters] Several senior leaders and opposition lawmakers, including Modi and Congress’s Rahul Gandhi, have been holding large rallies for supporters amid elections in five regions, including West Bengal.

Visuals from the rallies have shown thousands of mask-less people crowded together and chanting slogans as they listen to speeches from politicians, in clear violation of social distancing and other COVID-19 norms.

Home Minister Amit Shah was scheduled to hold public meetings and roadshows in West Bengal on Friday.

Meanwhile, hundreds of people at a religious gathering in Haridwar in the north of the country tested positive for COVID-19 as tens of thousands of devout pilgrims jostled to take a holy dip in the Ganges.

The weeks-long Kumbh Mela festival, where ascetics bathe to wash away their sins, began earlier this month and officials have warned they expect cases to rise significantly. One local official called it a “super-spreader” event.

Vaccination drive

There are also growing calls for officials to speed up the country’s vaccination programme as hospitals are swamped with patients.

India has so far injected 115 million vaccine doses, the highest globally after the US and China, but that covers only a small fraction of its 1.4 billion people.

In the heat of the latest wave of infections, India has shifted from being a mass vaccine exporter to a major importer.

Officials abruptly changed the rules to allow vaccine imports to be fast-tracked, having earlier rebuffed foreign drugmakers like Pfizer. It will import Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine starting this month to cover as many as 125 million people.

India is also seeking to inoculate more of its population using domestically produced shots.

India on Thursday gave approval to the Haffkine Institute in the western Maharashtra state to begin producing Bharat Biotech’s COVAXIN shot, a move that is expected to help ease supply bottlenecks.

The country is currently administering COVAXIN and AstraZeneca’s vaccine, which is manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and branded as Covishield.

Disturbing trend

Indian hospitals are now struggling to cope, running short of beds, oxygen and coronavirus medicines like remdesivir.

In a new disturbing trend, doctors across the most-affected cities told AFP news agency they had seen an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients aged below 45 and suffering from more severe symptoms compared with last year.

“We are also seeing children under the ages of 12 and 15 being admitted with symptoms in the second wave. Last year there were practically no children presenting symptoms,” said Khusrav Bajan, a consultant at Mumbai’s PD Hinduja National Hospital.

Many crematoriums are also struggling, according to press reports.

“Since 9am, we have been waiting outside. Now it is 1pm and still, we need another two-three hours for our turn,” said one relative outside a Bengaluru crematorium.

On 31 March, Vladimir Putin’s most prominent opponent went on hunger strike to demand proper medical treatment for back pain and numbness in his legs and hands.

On Saturday, Joe Biden added his voice to a growing international chorus of protest at the treatment of the activist, describing his situation as “totally unfair”.

Navalny, 44, was imprisoned in February and is serving two-and-a-half years on old embezzlement charges in a penal colony in the town of Pokrov about 100km (60 miles) east of Moscow.

Navalny’s personal doctor Anastasia Vasilyeva and three more doctors, including cardiologist Yaroslav Ashikhmin, have asked prison officials to grant them immediate access.

“Our patient can die any minute,” Ashikhmin said on Facebook on Saturday, pointing to the opposition politician’s high potassium levels and saying Navalny should be moved to intensive care. “Fatal arrhythmia can develop any minute.”

Navalny barely survived a poisoning with the novichok nerve agent in August which he has blamed on the Kremlin. His doctors say his hunger strike may have exacerbated his condition.

Having blood potassium levels higher than 6.0 mmol (millimole) per litre usually requires immediate treatment. Navalny’s were at 7.1, the doctors said. “This means both impaired renal function and that serious heart rhythm problems can happen any minute,” said a statement on Vasilyeva’s Twitter account.

The doctors said he had to be examined immediately “taking into account the blood tests and his recent poisoning”.

Navalny’s spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh, who accompanied him when he collapsed on a plane after the poisoning in August, said the situation was critical again. “Alexei is dying,” she said on Facebook. “With his condition, it’s a matter of days.”

She said she felt like she was “on that plane again, only this time it’s landing in slow motion”, pointing out that access to Navalny was restricted and few Russians were aware of what was actually going on with him in prison.

On Saturday, responding to reporters’ questions about Navalny’s plight, Biden responded: “It’s totally, totally unfair, totally inappropriate.”

More than 70 prominent international writers, artists and academics, including Jude Law, Vanessa Redgrave and Benedict Cumberbatch, have called on Putin to ensure that Navalny receives proper treatment immediately. Their appeal was published late on Friday by France’s Le Monde newspaper.

Navalny’s team had earlier announced plans to stage what they said would be “modern Russia’s biggest protest”. Navalny’s allies said they would set a date for the protest once 500,000 supporters had registered with a website. As of 22.30pm on Saturday, more than 450,000 people had signed up.

Yarmysh on Saturday urged more Russians to sign up, saying that a big rally could help save Navalny’s life. “Putin only reacts to mass street protests,” she added.

Earlier this week, Navalny’s wife, Yulia, who visited him in the penal colony, said her husband now weighed 76kg – down 9kg since starting his hunger strike.

On Friday, Russian prosecutors asked a court to label Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation and the network of his regional offices “extremist” organisations in a move that would outlaw them in Russia and could result in jail time for their members.

“The darkest times are beginning for free-thinking people, for civil society in Russia,” said Leonid Volkov, the head of Navalny’s regional offices.",566,3643,12,72

0,U.S. and China agree to take joint climate action,https://www.axios.com/us-china-agree-joint-climate-action-838a35b5-92a8-47c6-901f-1a7e9926f5bc.html,"Despite an increasingly tense relationship, the U.S. and China agreed Saturday to work together to tackle global climate change, including by ""raising ambition"" for emissions cuts during the 2020s — a key goal of the Biden administration.

Why it matters: The joint communique released Saturday evening commits the world's two largest emitters of greenhouse gases to work together to keep the most ambitious temperature target contained in the Paris Climate Agreement viable by potentially taking additional emissions cuts prior to 2030.

In addition, the document leaves open the possibility that the U.S. and China can act jointly on climate change while having strong disagreements on trade, technology, and national security issues, though how far this cooperation can extend remains to be seen.

Details: Ahead of negotiations in Shanghai between John Kerry, President Biden's special envoy for climate, and Xie Zhenhua, his Chinese counterpart, the State Department had worked to downplay expectations.

In fact, the participation of Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the White House's virtual climate summit on April 22-23 has been in doubt.

But the document indicates China will participate in the summit, stating: ""Both countries look forward to the US-hosted Leaders Summit on Climate on April 22/23. They share the Summit’s goal of raising global climate ambition on mitigation, adaptation...""

In addition, the document calls for both countries to move away from funding fossil fuel energy sources, and toward clean energy.

Yes, but: The document is lacking in specifics, including any new emissions targets from either country.

Driving the news: China is by far the world's top current emitter of greenhouse gases, while the U.S. is the second-largest emitter. However, when viewed historically, the U.S. is the top contributor to global warming.

The problem cannot be solved without the participation of these two countries, and they're at loggerheads over a host of other issues.

The big picture: Meanwhile, the world is well off track to meeting the goals of the Paris agreement, which calls for keeping global warming to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and trying to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or. 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, relative to the preindustrial era.

Warming beyond these levels raises the odds of potentially catastrophic impacts, scientists warn.

Currently, the world is on track to warm by more than 3 degrees Celsius, or 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit, by 2100.

In order to meet the Paris targets, studies show, the world must begin slashing emissions prior to 2030.

Of note: China is a major user of coal-fired power plants, and there have been concerns that it has been taking a fossil fuel intensive approach to its Belt and Road Initiative involving many developing nations.

What they're saying: Alden Meyer, a senior associate with the climate think tank E3G, told Axios that the joint statement ""seems generally very positive,"" but also notes many details remain to be worked out.

""It's probably a very negotiated text, but it committed China in a sense to taking actions in the 2020s, which is the question people have been having since President Xi’s [2060] net-zero commitment last September — what will China do to accelerate action in this decade toward that net-zero goal,"" he said.

Li Shuo, policy officer with Greenpeace East Asia, told Axios that the joint statement ""highlights the unequivocal commitment of both the US and China to work together in addressing the climate crisis. It is a firm step towards cooperation amid great geopolitical challenges.

""The difficult meetings in Shanghai bore fruit. Let that move the politics closer to where science requires us to be.""

Catch up fast: Prior to the successful negotiation of the Paris Agreement in 2015, the U.S. struck a bilateral agreement with China to address emissions, paving the way for a more united front at the actual summit.

To date, China has pledged to cut carbon emissions per unit of economic output by over 65% by 2030 and boost the share of nonfossil fuels in energy consumption to roughly 25% by then.

It also aims to be carbon-neutral by 2060 and have its emissions peak before 2030.

The intrigue: Kerry's visit, and the participation of Xie, who had been his counterpart in 2015 as well, demonstrated that the U.S. was trying to return to that formula.

Context: Much has changed since Paris was signed.

Global emissions have gone up, and the effects of climate change have become more obvious in the form of massive wildfires in the U.S. and Australia, melting glaciers and heat waves. And under President Trump, the U.S. abandoned the Paris agreement, only to rejoin it under Biden.

What to watch: While the communique mentions cooperation in several key technological areas of clean energy, a big question is whether China will offer a firm commitment to a pre-2030 emissions reduction target at the White House summit.

Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Friday that Russia will also expel 10 US diplomats, curb the activity of US nonprofit groups in the country, impose new limits on American diplomats and diplomatic outposts, and consider ""painful"" measures against US businesses in retaliation for Thursday's punitive actions by the Biden administration.

Lavrov also said the Kremlin has told the US Ambassador to Russia, John Sullivan, that he should return to Washington to hold ""detailed"" and ""serious"" consultations. Russia's ambassador to the US returned to Moscow in March after Biden said he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin to be a ""killer"" in a TV interview.

The moves are ""just a part of the possibilities at our disposal,"" the Russian foreign ministry warned in a statement on its website, and follow Thursday's announcement that Moscow will block foreign naval ships and state vessels in the Kerch Strait, the sea of Azov and parts of the Black Sea -- a move NATO and the Pentagon criticized. The foreign ministry statement added that the US should ""show prudence by abandoning the confrontational course"" and that ""not a single wave of sanctions will go unpunished.""

Friday's wave of Russian penalties comes in a week when Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking for the US and its NATO allies, expressed deep concerns about Moscow's military build-up along the border with Ukraine, and the US intelligence community said in an annual report that Russia ""presents one of the most serious intelligence threats to the United States.""

A US State Department spokesperson called the Russian steps ""escalatory and regrettable.""

""Our recent actions were proportionate and appropriate to Russia's harmful activities,"" they said. ""Today's announcement by the Russian government was escalatory and regrettable. It is not in our interest to get into an escalatory cycle, but we reserve the right to respond to any Russian retaliation against the United States.""

The Russian foreign ministry released a statement on its website Friday naming Wray and Haines, along with US Attorney General Merrick Garland, Biden's domestic policy advisor Susan Rice, Homeland Security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and the director of the US Federal Bureau of Prisons Michael Carvajal.

The statement also names John Bolton, former national security adviser to former President Donald Trump and former CIA Director Robert James Woolsey, Jr.

""Taking into account the unprecedented nature of the complications provoked by Washington in Russian- American relations, it was decided to deviate from the usual practice not to 'highlight' countermeasures publicly undertaken by the Russian side,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement.

The State Department has not responded to CNN's requests for comment.

Lavrov told reporters Friday that Putin's foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov recommended to Sullivan on Friday that he return to DC.

""The situation is quite multi-layered, it needs to be studied in detail,"" Lavrov said. ""Moreover, sometimes incomprehensible things happen in Washington. Or at least things that are not completely clear. Therefore, today Ushakov recommended Ambassador John Sullivan to go to his capital and hold detailed, serious consultations there.""

In a statement to CNN, Sullivan said the US embassy had not received ""any official diplomatic correspondence"" on Russian actions against the US.

""We have seen a message that appears on the website belonging to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and are reviewing the information therein, in consultation with Washington,"" the statement said. ""We have not received any official diplomatic correspondence providing details of the Russian government actions against the diplomatic mission of the United States of America in Russia.""

'Tit for tat'

Lavrov, speaking at a press conference in Moscow with his Serbian counterpart, described the measures as a ""tit-for-tat response"" to the Biden administration's Thursday announcement of sanctions to punish Moscow for its interference in the 2020 US election, its SolarWinds cyberattack and its ongoing occupation and ""severe human rights abuses"" in Crimea.

Those US penalties included the expulsion of 10 Russian diplomats in Washington, including ""representatives of Russian intelligence services,"" for the cyber hack and the election meddling.

""Ten diplomats were on a list the US side handed over to us asking to ensure their leaving the United States. We will give a tit-for-tat response to that. We will also ask 10 US diplomats to leave our country,"" Lavrov said.

""Some time ago, before the package [of sanctions] recently announced by Biden, the Americans added eight representatives of Russian structures, the Russian leadership, including the presidential administration and the Prosecutor General's Office, to the sanctions list,"" Lavrov said. ""Today we will publish a list of eight officials who represent the governing structures of the Washington administration. They will also be included in our sanctions list.""

The foreign ministry announced a slew of other measures that could make it hard for US diplomats to function inside Russia.

The State Department will be limited to sending only 10 employees a year to Russia for short-term assignments; the US embassy will be banned from employing Russian citizens or those from third countries; and Moscow is terminating a bilateral agreement that allowed US diplomats to travel around Russia without notifying the foreign ministry.

Lavrov also said the Kremlin ""will restrict and terminate the activities on our territory of American foundations and non-governmental organizations, which in fact, directly interfere in our domestic political life."" The foreign ministry said it would target ""American foundations and NGOs controlled by the State Department and other American government agencies.""

Tanya Lokshina, the Moscow-based Europe and Central Asia associate director at Human Rights Watch, said, ""For years now, the Russian government has been taking different steps to stifle the work of independent critical organizations, be they Russian NGOS or foreign NGOs,"" using laws, hostile media campaigns, harassment and painting them as foreign-funded or foreign-controlled.

Russia is also considering more ""painful"" measures against US businesses, Lavrov said, framing them as a response to sanctions the US placed on Russian sovereign debt and adding that for now, the Kremlin is keeping those steps ""in reserve.""

The Biden administration is barring US financial institutions from participating in the primary market for bonds issued by Russia's central bank and other leading financial institutions. US financial institutions weren't big buyers of Russian bonds, but their withdrawal from the market as potential buyers will still have an impact, said Gary Hufbauer, a former Treasury official and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

""For obvious reasons, we do not have comparable levers of influence on the United States of this scale,"" Lavrov said Friday, adding that ""our experts"" believe the Russian economy can handle it. ""In any case, we have found and will find a way out of any situation. But we also have the opportunity to take painful measures against American business. We will keep them in reserve,"" Lavrov warned.

Biden said Thursday that the sanctions against Russia were a proportionate response to cyber-attacks against the US and interference in two presidential elections, but also emphasized that ""now is the time to de-escalate"" tensions with the country.

Trying to avoid escalation

As part of Thursday's announcement, the US formally named the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service as the force behind the SolarWinds hack that affected the federal government and wide swaths of the private sector.

During remarks at the White House, Biden said that he told Russian President Vladimir Putin during a Tuesday phone call that he could have gone further. Biden said that while he wants to avoid escalating tensions, he made clear to Putin that he would not hesitate to take further action in the future.

""We cannot allow a foreign power to interfere in our democratic process with impunity,"" Biden said.

He added, ""I told (Putin) that we would shortly be responding in a measured and proportionate way because we had concluded that they had interfered in the election and SolarWinds was ... totally inappropriate.""

The 10 Russian diplomats who are being expelled are based in Washington, DC, and New York, and will have 30 days to leave the country, a US official familiar with the plans explained. Asked how the US chose the 10 diplomats who will be expelled, a senior administration official told reporters Thursday that those individuals ""were acting with a manner inconsistent with their status in the US,"" and declined to provide further details.

These servings of kung pao chicken and egg rolls seemed to be eaten primarily as fuel for teams of high-powered attorneys running on only four hours of sleep as they became deeply invested in the case, often before gasping when a pile of papers fell off the table to reveal the evidence that they had been searching for all along.” The study also found that the other 13% of Chinese takeout was eaten by the overweight child molesters the prosecutors were investigating.",238,1413,15,101

Mr Macron visited the building site on Thursday to view the progress on the rebuilding project and argued that the country’s heritage had not been forgotten despite delays caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

“We’re seeing here how, in two years, a huge job has been accomplished,” Mr Macron said, flanked by ministers, architects and the retired French army general who is overseeing the restoration.

“We’re all impressed with what we see, with the work that has been achieved in two years. Bravo,” he told workers at the site.

“We’ve done a lot, and we’ve avoided the worst.”

The president added that it was clear that more work remained to be done on the project, as he recalled the “emotion” throughout France on the day of the shocking fire in April 2019.

He also offered a ""huge thank you"" and a message of determination to all the workers mobilised for the restoration project.

Mr Macron had promised that the cathedral would be rebuilt by 2024, but officials have acknowledged work will not be fully completed by then.

Factors such as the Covid-19 pandemic have contributed to the slower than expected pace of the reconstruction, along with other complications, such as the vast amounts of toxic lead distributed onto Notre Dame following the blaze.

Officials warned this month that the cathedral and its esplanade could remain under construction for another 15 or 20 years, but they have pledged to make sure that it will be open for prayer at least by the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.

“The objective... is to return Notre Dame to worshippers and to visits in 2024. That means that in 2024, Mass will be able to be organised in the cathedral,” Jeremie Patrier-Leitus, a spokesperson for the restoration, said.

Since 2019, religious ceremonies have taken place at Notre Dame’s temporary liturgical base at the nearby church of Saint-Germain l’Auxerrois.

Brasília (AFP)

Brazil's full Supreme Court upheld a ruling Thursday annulling former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's corruption convictions, which cleared the way for him to run for a new presidential term next year.

In an 8-3 ruling, the court upheld Justice Edson Fachin's March 8 decision quashing Lula's convictions on procedural grounds, which has upended Brazilian politics as far-right President Jair Bolsonaro gears up to seek reelection.

The ruling does not find Lula innocent. But it essentially puts prosecutors back to square one by sending the cases to another court.

In the meantime, Lula, the popular but tarnished leftist who led Brazil through an economic boom from 2003 to 2010, has emerged as the top contender to unseat Bolsonaro in the October 2022 elections.

Lula's lawyers called the decision ""historic.""

""This is another Supreme Court ruling that reestablishes the credibility of the justice system in our country,"" they said in a statement.

Bolsonaro said the ruling means ""Lula is now a candidate"" for 2022 -- and ominously warned of the consequences.

""Look what Brazil's future is going to be like with the kind of people he'd bring into the presidency,"" he said in his weekly live address on Facebook.

""You can all draw your own conclusions.""

Lula, 75, has not officially declared himself a candidate.

But polls put the steelworker-turned-president neck-and-neck with 66-year-old Bolsonaro, and in some cases ahead.

- Battle lines drawn -

Lula was jailed in 2018 on charges of taking bribes from companies seeking juicy contracts at state oil giant Petrobras.

Prosecutors say he accepted gifts including a triplex beach apartment and renovations at a ranch property in exchange for greasing companies' access to juicy contracts with state oil giant Petrobras.

The cases felled him just as he was gearing up to seek a new presidential term, in elections Bolsonaro ultimately won.

Lula has always maintained he is innocent and that the cases against him were a conspiracy to sideline him politically.

After Fachin's initial ruling annulling his convictions, he came out swinging at Bolsonaro, attacking the president's ""imbecile"" handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed 365,000 lives in Brazil -- the world's second-highest death toll.

""Don't be scared of me. They say I'm a radical because I want to get to the root of this country's problems,"" he said in his comeback press conference, which analysts called a campaign speech in all but name.

- Judge accused of bias -

The charges against Lula grew out of ""Operation Car Wash,"" an investigation that blew the lid off a massive corruption scheme in which top politicians and business executives systematically siphoned billions of dollars from Petrobras.

Fachin ruled the court in the southern state of Parana that handled the Car Wash cases did not have jurisdiction for Lula's charges because they were not directly related to the Petrobras scheme.

He ordered the four cases -- two convictions and two pending judgments -- transferred to another court.

Prosecutors had asked the Supreme Court to at a minimum reinstate the two convictions, arguing they were legally sound and that Lula was ""named as the ringleader"" of the Petrobras scheme -- an accusation they have struggled to pin on him in court.

Lula spent 18 months in jail before being freed in 2019 pending appeal.

The full Supreme Court is also due to rule on prosecutors' appeal of a decision that found the lead Car Wash judge, Sergio Moro, was biased in convicting Lula.

They set deliberations on that case for next Thursday.

Moro controversially accepted the post of justice minister in Bolsonaro's government when the latter won the 2018 election.

That fueled accusations he colluded to sideline Lula and get Bolsonaro elected.

Moro later had a falling-out with Bolsonaro, accusing the president of interfering in federal police investigations. He resigned in April 2020.

0,China Has Trademarked the Entire South China Sea,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/mark-04132021192429.html,"Satellite image from March 21 shows Scarborough Shoal, one of the features trademarked by the Chinese government.

Not content with claiming sovereignty over nearly every crag of rock and spit of sand in the South China Sea, China has taken the unusual step of registering trademarks over hundreds of land features scattered throughout those disputed waters, an investigation by BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service, has found.

That action is meeting with disapproval from other South China Sea claimants. Taiwan and Vietnam have rejected the legitimacy of the trademarks, which experts described as a possible attempt by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to control how domestic and even foreign companies use South China Sea branding.

Unlike most of China’s assertive behavior in the South China Sea, the trademark registrations largely slipped under the radar when they were initiated seven years ago. But now a review of Chinese government records from 2014 by BenarNews has revealed that Sansha City — which is responsible for administering China’s claims in the South China Sea — filed thousands of domestic trademark applications covering 281 specific rocks, reefs, shoals, and other contested features as well as entire regions of the South China Sea.

Each of these trademarks is composed of the feature’s name in stylized Chinese calligraphy and is categorized under one of 45 international trademark classes, which cover everything from musical instruments to legal services. Many also include an English transliteration of the feature’s name and an illustrated logo that offers a colorful view of the feature as seen from above. The depiction of features appears to predate China’s massive campaign of land reclamation in the Paracel and Spratly Islands which kicked off in 2014.

Declaring sovereignty

Julian Ku, a professor at the Maurice A. Deane School of Law at Hofstra University, said these trademarks could potentially help the PRC government wield lawsuits to control how Chinese and foreign companies use South China Sea branding.

He said that this would be a form of “lawfare” — China’s use of domestic and international law to advance its position in the disputes.

China contends that it holds sovereignty over hundreds of features across the entire South China Sea as well as extensive rights to its waters, a position not supported by international law. Its claims are contested by several neighboring countries, though it does not appear that those countries, including Vietnam and the Philippines, have registered comparable trademarks.

In response to a request for comment on China’s trademarks, an official at the Vietnamese Embassy in Washington, D.C. told BenarNews that “every way to spread information that is against international law and historical truth is valueless and unlawful, as well as will not be able to change the truth about Viet Nam’s sovereignty over Hoang Sa [Paracels] and Truong Sa [Spratlys].”

The commercial use of South China Sea imagery — particularly maps — has long been a source of tension between the rival claimants. The inclusion of China’s controversial nine-dash line on a map in DreamWorks’ 2019 film Abominable, for example, caused authorities in the Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia to ban the film.

And just last week, Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Le Thi Thu Hang said that “companies operating in Vietnam must respect and strictly comply with the laws of Vietnam,” criticizing foreign brands that include China’s nine-dash line in maps on their products.

It is clear from official commentary on the issue that China sees intrinsic value in asserting commercial rights over what are disputed territories. Quoting a Sansha City official, state-run China Industry and Commerce News reported in 2016 that “applying to register trademarks for the names of Sansha City’s islands and reefs in accordance with China’s ‘Trademark Law’ was the most direct embodiment of declaring sovereignty.”

Sansha City also registered these trademarks to “protect the geographical name ownership of each island, reef, shoal, and island” and “prevent trademark squatting,” China Industry and Commerce News said, referring to when one entity preemptively registers another entity’s trademark, effectively stealing it.

Claiming every last rock and reef

The 281 features trademarked by Sansha City largely match the list of 287 features that China named and claimed in 1983, which was expanded in April 2020.

For example, the city trademarked the Paracel Islands, an archipelago also claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan; the Crescent Group and Amphitrite Group, which form the two main halves of the Paracel Islands; the Qilian Islets, which is a sub-region within the Amphitrite Group; and Tree Island, which is part of the Qilian Islets.

It trademarked numerous rocks and reefs in the Spratly Islands too, including features controlled by other claimant states like Taiwan-occupied Itu Aba, Philippines-occupied Thitu Island, and Vietnam-occupied Sin Cowe Island.

Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council said this week that it has unquestionable sovereignty over Itu Aba as well as long-term effective governance over the island. The council said that China’s trademarks are inconsistent with international standards and criticized them as a deliberate attempt to create a false image of Chinese jurisdiction over Itu Aba.

Tensions between Taiwan and the PRC over their competing South China Sea claims have been increasingly high in recent weeks as China has operated drones and military aircraft near Taiwan-occupied Pratas Island.

Sansha City has not in fact registered a trademark for Pratas, but it has for other disputed features that have lately been in the news. Among them are Scarborough Shoal and Whitsun Reef — each the location of a standoff between China and the Philippines, the first at Scarborough in 2012 and the second at Whitsun in March 2021.

The presence of hundreds of Chinese fishing or militia vessels at Whitsun Reef generated significant diplomatic pushback from Manila in late March and on Tuesday prompted Manila to summon China’s ambassador to the Philippines. It has also drawn statements of concern and condemnation from Washington, Hanoi, Canberra, London, and other capitals.

Authorities in the Philippines did say last week that they are aware of China’s trademarks but they declined to comment. Malaysian officials also declined to comment.

Questionable legal strength

Chinese government records show that Sansha City has applied for at least 2,675 trademarks, with all but a handful of applications submitted in 2014. Most but not all of these applications appear to have been successfully approved.

In 82 instances, Sansha City trademarked a feature more than once, sometimes filing trademarks under each of the 45 international trademark classes for a single feature. It also trademarked Scarborough Shoal under two separate names, submitting 45 trademark applications for “Huangyan Island” and 45 for “Minzhu Reef.”

Despite China registering the trademarks seven years ago, they do not appear to have been used widely – with one exception. The “Sansha” logo that the city trademarked can be spotted on the city’s supply ships, its website, and podiums used by the municipal government. “Sansha” refers to the Xisha Islands, Nansha Islands, and Zhongsha Islands, which are China’s names for the Paracels, Spratlys, Scarborough Shoal, and Macclesfield Bank.

Ku said the legal implications of these trademarks are not entirely clear.

“Trademarks are legal protections for the use of names or logos for commercial purposes,” which means that “trademarks would not generally be understood to bolster a country’s sovereignty claims under international law,” he said.

Moreover, Ku said that “trademarks are generally recognized first under domestic law and you have to register for a trademark country-by-country” and “each country still has the right to reject the trademark registration for domestic legal reasons.”

Ku also questioned whether such geographical locations can even be trademarked.

“There are protections in U.S. and in international law for geographical indications when associated with (typically) food products such as ‘Champagne’ but trademarking the land feature without any particular product is new to me and I think somewhat uncertain under most countries’ trademark laws,” he said.

Despite these limitations, these trademarks could still be useful for the Chinese government.

For example, these trademarks may have allowed the Chinese government to block unapproved commercial use of South China Sea branding by Chinese companies.

Ku said that these trademarks could also be intended to deter foreign companies from using South China Sea branding.

He said “if any company tried to market a product with a land feature name associated with it, in theory, a Chinese trademark holder would be able to sue.”

“But since I think it is unlikely that other countries would recognize these trademark claims by China, I am not as worried,” Ku said.

He also noted that the Chinese government only trademarked the Chinese names of these features — as well as English transliterations — rather than their widely recognized names in other languages, likely further limiting the international impact of these trademarks.

“Still, even the potential of harassing litigation could be a meaningful deterrent,” Ku said.

CAIRO -- A passenger train derailed Sunday north of Cairo, killing at least 11 people, Egyptian authorities said. It was the latest of several rail accidents to hit the country in recent years.

Four train wagons ran off the railway at the city of Banha in Qalyubia province, just outside Cairo, the railway authority said in a statement. Videos on social media showed wagons overturned and passengers escaping to safety along the railway.

The train was travelling to the Nile Delta city of Mansoura from the Egyptian capital, the statement said.

The Health Ministry said in a statement that besides the dead, at least 98 people were injured, with most of them suffering from broken bones, cuts and bruises.

At least 60 ambulances were sent to the scene and the injured were taken to nearby hospitals, the ministry added.

Salvage teams could be seen searching for survivors and removing the derailed wagons. It was not immediately clear what caused the train to derail. Prosecutors said they were investigating the causes of the crash.

The state-run Ahram daily reported that authorities have detained at least 10 railway officials, including the train driver and his assistant, pending an investigation into the crash.

At Banha University hospital, people lined up to donate blood for the crash victims. Families were also present looking for loved ones who had been travelling on the train.

“We were surprised by the strain speeding up,” said Tarek Gomaa, one of the injured. “We found ourselves on top of each other.”

Sunday’s train accident came three weeks after two passenger trains collided in the province of Sohag, killing at least 18 people and injuring 200 others, including children.

Prosecutors said they found that gross negligence by railway employees was behind the deadly March 25 crash, which caused public outcry across the country.

Train wrecks and mishaps are common in Egypt, where the railway system has a history of badly maintained equipment and mismanagement. The government says it has launched a broad renovation and modernization initiative. President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said in March 2018 that the government needs about 250 billion Egyptian pounds, or $14.1 billion, to overhaul the run-down rail system.

Hundreds of train accidents are reported every year. In February 2019 an unmanned locomotive slammed into a barrier inside Cairo’s main Ramses railway station, causing a huge explosion and a fire that killed at least 25 people. That crash prompted the then-transportation minister to resign.

In August 2017, two passenger trains collided just outside the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria, killing 43 people. In 2016, at least 51 people were killed when two commuter trains collided near Cairo.

Egypt’s deadliest train crash was in 2002, when over 300 people were killed after a fire broke out in an overnight train traveling from Cairo to southern Egypt.

Milton DK It is time to address airborne transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). If an infectious virus spreads predominantly through large respiratory droplets that fall quickly, the key control measures are reducing direct contact, cleaning surfaces, physical barriers, physical distancing, use of masks within droplet distance, respiratory hygiene, and wearing high-grade protection only for so-called aerosol-generating health-care procedures. Such policies need not distinguish between indoors and outdoors, since a gravity-driven mechanism for transmission would be similar for both settings. But if an infectious virus is mainly airborne, an individual could potentially be infected when they inhale aerosols produced when an infected person exhales, speaks, shouts, sings, sneezes, or coughs. Reducing airborne transmission of virus requires measures to avoid inhalation of infectious aerosols, including ventilation, air filtration, reducing crowding and time spent indoors, use of masks whenever indoors, attention to mask quality and fit, and higher-grade protection for health-care staff and front-line workers.Airborne transmission of respiratory viruses is difficult to demonstrate directly.Mixed findings from studies that seek to detect viable pathogen in air are therefore insufficient grounds for concluding that a pathogen is not airborne if the totality of scientific evidence indicates otherwise. Decades of painstaking research, which did not include capturing live pathogens in the air, showed that diseases once considered to be spread by droplets are airborne.Ten streams of evidence collectively support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted primarily by the airborne route.

First, superspreading events account for substantial SARS-CoV-2 transmission; indeed, such events may be the pandemic's primary drivers.Detailed analyses of human behaviours and interactions, room sizes, ventilation, and other variables in choir concerts, cruise ships, slaughterhouses, care homes, and correctional facilities, among other settings, have shown patterns—eg, long-range transmission and overdispersion of the basic reproduction number (R), discussed below—consistent with airborne spread of SARS-CoV-2 that cannot be adequately explained by droplets or fomites.The high incidence of such events strongly suggests the dominance of aerosol transmission.

Direct measurements show that speaking produces thousands of aerosol particles and few large droplets,which supports the airborne route.

Sampling of airborne virus is technically challenging for several reasons, including limited effectiveness of some sampling methods for collecting fine particles, viral dehydration during collection, viral damage due to impact forces (leading to loss of viability), reaerosolisation of virus during collection, and viral retention in the sampling equipment.Measles and tuberculosis, two primarily airborne diseases, have never been cultivated from room air.

Ninth, no study to our knowledge has provided strong or consistent evidence to refute the hypothesis of airborne SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Some people have avoided SARS-CoV-2 infection when they have shared air with infected people, but this situation could be explained by a combination of factors, including variation in the amount of viral shedding between infectious individuals by several orders of magnitude and different environmental (especially ventilation) conditions.Individual and environmental variation means that a minority of primary cases (notably, individuals shedding high levels of virus in indoor, crowded settings with poor ventilation) account for a majority of secondary infections, which is supported by high-quality contact tracing data from several countries.Wide variation in respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 counters arguments that SARS-CoV-2 cannot be airborne because the virus has a lower R(estimated at around 2·5)than measles (estimated at around 15),especially since R, which is an average, does not account for the fact that only a minority of infectious individuals shed high amounts of virus.

Tenth, there is limited evidence to support other dominant routes of transmission—ie, respiratory droplet or fomite.Ease of infection between people in close proximity to each other has been cited as proof of respiratory droplet transmission of SARS-CoV-2. However, close-proximity transmission in most cases along with distant infection for a few when sharing air is more likely to be explained by dilution of exhaled aerosols with distance from an infected person.The flawed assumption that transmission through close proximity implies large respiratory droplets or fomites was historically used for decades to deny the airborne transmission of tuberculosis and measles.This became medical dogma, ignoring direct measurements of aerosols and droplets which reveal flaws such as the overwhelming number of aerosols produced in respiratory activities and the arbitrary boundary in particle size of 5 μm between aerosols and droplets, instead of the correct boundary of 100 μm.It is sometimes argued that since respiratory droplets are larger than aerosols, they must contain more viruses. However, in diseases where pathogen concentrations have been quantified by particle size, smaller aerosols showed higher pathogen concentrations than droplets when both were measured.

In conclusion, we propose that it is a scientific error to use lack of direct evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in some air samples to cast doubt on airborne transmission while overlooking the quality and strength of the overall evidence base. There is consistent, strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 spreads by airborne transmission. Although other routes can contribute, we believe that the airborne route is likely to be dominant. The public health community should act accordingly and without further delay.

William Amos, who represents the western Quebec riding of Pontiac, appeared on-screen without clothes moving around his office. Amos appeared on a video feed that only MPs and House of Commons staff can see, separate from the public-facing ParlVu video system.

CBC News obtained a photo that shows Amos standing without clothes in what appears to be an office with Canadian and Quebec flags in the background. He is holding something that blocks the view of his private parts.

In a statement, Amos said the incident was the result of an unfortunate error.

0,Rebel groups see opportunity in post-coup Myanmar,https://southeastasiaglobe.com/rebel-groups-post-coup-myanmar/,"Myanmar’s coup has opened an unexpected window of opportunity for the various ethnic rebel outfits, which have no loyalty to either the junta or to deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi, but could together pose a threat to the army’s rule.

The country has been in turmoil since the military ousted Suu Kyi in February, crushing a 10-year experiment with democracy that had been enthusiastically embraced by the dominant Bamar ethnicity.

But for many ethnic minorities, her administration was more foe than friend.

While each ethnic armed group has its own demands, all want a version of federalism, giving them at least some measure of self-governance.

Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy (NLD) once offered them that in exchange for electoral support.

“The Bamar majority have given such a promise from time to time, without it materialising,” Khu Oo Reh of the Karenni National Progressive Party (KNPP), told AFP.

“It was just words.”

Despite their deep-seated distrust of the NLD, several groups have condemned the putsch and the junta’s use of violence — including killing more than 700 civilians — to quell the subsequent uprising.

At least three groups in Myanmar’s east, including the KNPP, are sheltering thousands of anti-junta dissidents.

The anti-coup movement is now watching closely to see if the rebels will harden their opposition against the junta.

Thant Myint-U, author of “The Hidden History of Burma”, said the current moment could prove an opportunity for these groups to press for federalism.

“Their actions over these coming months may have an outsize impact in what’s still an incredibly fluid situation,” the historian told AFP.

“The seven-to-eight most powerful ethnic armed organisations now hold greater sway over Myanmar’s future than any time since independence.”

‘World’s longest civil war’

The end of British colonial rule in 1948 left a complex patchwork of cultural, ethnic and linguistic groups awkwardly sharing the new state of Myanmar.

A messy struggle over autonomy, control of lucrative drug production and natural resources has pitted more than 20 different groups against each other — among them the Bamar-majority military.

The multi-faceted conflict has spanned seven decades, and been described as the world’s longest-running civil war.

The military — which has never been under civilian rule — sought to dampen the conflicts with strategic ceasefires, effectively reaching a detente with some of the rebel groups.

But in the wake of the coup, those ceasefires have begun to fray.

The powerful Ta’ang National Liberation Association (TNLA) and two allied groups have said they were abandoning their truce, accusing the junta of war crimes.

“They must apologise to the ethnic minorities for what the previous government has done”

That condemnation has raised protesters’ hopes that the militias would unite to take up arms against the junta, forming a so-called “federal army”.

The potential for spiralling conflict has prompted observers like U.N. special envoy for Myanmar Christine Schraner Burgener to warn that “a bloodbath is imminent.”

The idea of mounting organised self-defence was first proposed by the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH), a group of lawmakers mostly from the NLD who are attempting to represent the elected government.

They have also unveiled a “Federal Democracy Charter”, which features a governing role for ethnic armed groups.

The TNLA and other northern groups — some of whom have ties with Beijing — have so far remained silent on the CRPH’s overtures for unity.

Groups in the east of the country are also lukewarm.

General Yawd Serk, leader of the Restoration Council for Shan State (RCSS) — one of the country’s most powerful groups — called it a “positive move”, but stopped short of support.

“We are observing each other but we are not fully with (CRPH),” he told AFP.

Complicating the idea of a federal army is shifting loyalties between rebels; the RCSS, for example, is currently locked in conflict with two other Shan state organisations.

The various rebel groups also lack the fire and manpower of Myanmar’s military, a modern army equipped with fighter jets and armoured vehicles.

‘Our common enemy’

A humanitarian crisis is already brewing in neighbouring Karen state, where the military has carried out air strikes on towns held by the Karen National Union (KNU).

About 24,000 people were displaced by the bombings, said the KNU, with thousands crossing the border briefly into Thailand.

The KNU is sheltering around 2,000 dissidents who have fled urban hotspots.

One activist who stayed in their territory said the distrust of CRPH — and the ethnic Bamar majority in general — is high, even if the rebels are outraged over the coup.

“They must apologise to the ethnic minorities for what the previous government has done,” said the activist, declining to be named.

“That’s the very first step by which they can gain trust.”

KNU’s head of foreign affairs Padoh Saw Taw Nee said the group is “cautiously optimistic” about the CRPH’s promise for federalism.

“We just have to work together with them,” he told AFP.

“There are lots of obstacles but we are trying to find a way to overthrow our common enemy.”

0,Rwandan Priest Arrested in France for Alleged Role in Genocide,https://www.voanews.com/africa/rwandan-priest-arrested-france-alleged-role-genocide,"PARIS - A Rwandan priest was arrested in France this week on charges of providing, among other things, food to militiamen who massacred members of the Tutsi minority in his church during the 1994 genocide in the African country, authorities said Friday.

Marcel Hitayezu, who was born in 1956, was charged on Wednesday with genocide and being an accomplice to crimes against humanity, according to the national anti-terrorism prosecutor's office.

He was arrested the same day at his home in Montlieu-la-Garde, southwestern France, a source close to the case said.

Prosecutors said Hitayezu was the priest at a church in Mubuga, in southern Rwanda, when the genocide took place and in April 1994 withheld food and water to Tutsis who had sought refuge in his church. He instead gave food to extremist Interahamwe militiamen who attacked the refugees, prosecutors added.

""Marcel Hitayezu denied the charges at his initial appearance before a judge,"" the prosecutor's office said.

Extradition request

Rwanda had sought to extradite Hitayezu, but France's Cour de Cassation, the country's highest criminal court, in 2016 rejected the request, as it did similar requests by Kigali for others suspected of having taken part in the genocide that saw around 800,000 people slaughtered, mainly from the ethnic Tutsi minority.

The genocide between April and July 1994 began after Rwanda's Hutu President Juvenal Habyarimana, with whom Paris had cultivated close ties, was killed when his plane was shot down over Kigali on April 6.

Extremist Hutu militias went on rampage, killing Tutsis and moderate Hutus, in a bloodbath that came after decades of tensions and violence between the two communities.

French authorities had launched a probe into Rwanda's accusations against Hitayezu in July 2019, three years after the extradition request.

""He was until Wednesday vicar to the priest at the Montlieu-la-Garde church,"" the regional archdiocese told AFP.

'Excellent news'

According to the daily La Croix, Hitayezu spent three years in refugee camps in eastern Congo before arriving in France in 1998 or 1999. He was given refugee status in France in 2011.

""It's excellent news,"" Alain Gauthier, who has spent years hunting down people living in France suspected of having taken part in the genocide, told AFP on learning of the arrest.

Gauthier in 2001 also co-founded an association, the Collective of Civil Plaintiffs for Rwanda.

""The church must examine how it gave responsibilities to people suspected of having taken part in the genocide,"" Gauthier added.

Another priest who has taken refuge in France, Wenceslas Munyeshyaka, was also accused of being implicated in the 1994 massacres. But his case was dismissed by the courts in France.

An Auckland man has been charged with threatening to kill Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.

The 30-year-old, who has been granted interim name suppression, was arrested in Counties Manukau on Tuesday, police told the Herald.

The defendant did not attend his first appearance at the Manukau District Court today because he suffered an injury, his counsel told the courtroom.

He is also undergoing a mental health assessment.

He has been accused of a category three offence, which carries a maximum penalty of seven years in prison.

He has been remanded in custody without entering a plea until his next appearance on May 7.

He has also been charged with harassing a man online ""by sending constant social media messages having already sent messages between December 2020 and March 2021"", knowing that the harassment is likely to cause the man to ""reasonably fear for their safety"".

The Prime Minister's office declined to comment.

""As the matter is before the courts, police are not in a position to comment further,"" police said in a statement.

Threats made against Prime Minister

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has been subject to a number of threats during her two terms.

A man pleaded not guilty to a charge of sending threatening emails to Ardern between 2019 and 2020.

Police accused Michael Christopher Cruickshank of ""sending three emails having already sent 89 emails"" between October 17 last year and January 19 this year, a charging document viewed by the Herald reads.

The emails, the police allege, were intended to harass the Prime Minister and cause Ardern to ""fear for her safety (or) the safety of her family"".

The president’s remarks followed his administration’s rollout of new sanctions on Russia for election interference, hacking and other “malign activities,” including the current military buildup on Ukraine’s borders and the persecution of dissidents such as Alexei Navalny. The sanctions include moves against Russian technology companies accused of supporting their country’s intelligence services, as well as prohibiting U.S. financial institutions from participating in the primary market for Russian sovereign debt.

See: U.S. slaps new sanctions on Russia over election meddling and hacking

“We could have gone further, but I chose not to do so. I chose to be proportionate,” Biden said. “The United States is not looking to kick off a cycle of escalation and conflict with Russia. We want a stable, predictable relationship.”

But the president then added: “If Russia continues to interfere with our democracy, I’m prepared to take further actions to respond.”

Biden on Tuesday spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The White House said he expressed concern over the military buildup on Ukraine’s borders, and he proposed a summit meeting to discuss the full range of U.S.-Russia issues.

If the summit occurs, the U.S. and Russia could “launch a strategic stability dialogue,” Biden said in his speech on Thursday. “We can address critical, global challenges that require Russia an the United States to work together, including reining in nuclear threats from Iran and North Korea, ending this pandemic globally and meeting the existential crisis of climate change.”

The new sanctions on Russia weren’t universally praised in Washington. John Bolton, a hawk who served as national security adviser in the Trump administration before falling out with former President Donald Trump, said the actions don’t go far enough.

“Today’s sanctions fall short. Specifically, there is no mention of the Nord Stream II pipeline,” Bolton said in a tweet, referring to a subsea pipeline for natural gas NGK21, +1.53% being built between Russia and Germany that’s been the target of U.S. sanctions threats.

When asked about the pipeline following his speech, Biden said he has opposed it for a long time, but it’s “a complicated issue affecting our allies in Europe.”

A month ago, the president said he thinks Putin is a killer and warned that his Russian counterpart will “pay a price” after an American intelligence assessment said Putin authorized operations last year intended to hurt Biden’s White House campaign and exacerbate tension in the U.S.",427,2759,15,98
0,Why comparing blood clot risks from COVID-19 vaccines and birth control pills doesn’t work,https://on.mktw.net/3syug6B,"In the days since the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) called for a temporary pause in administering the Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +1.15% COVID-19 vaccine over several severe cases of rare blood clots, many people have attempted to soothe fears and offer context by listing other common habits that can increase the risk of blood clots even more.

Among the most popular comparisons has been the heightened risk of clots that women taking hormonal birth control pills face. And this, in turn, has led some people to question how much the medical community cares about women. The most common complaint: that the J&J jab was paused over a one in a million risk of severe blood clots for the general population, yet women have been encouraged to use oral contraceptives for decades even though 1 in 1,000 develop blood clots — which, it should be noted, is still rare.

But women’s health experts told MarketWatch that this isn’t a fair comparison for a couple of reasons. First, we’re talking about different types of clots here.

Dr. Jen Villavicencio, a fellow with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), told MarketWatch in a statement that it is “not appropriate” to compare the risk of clotting associated with the Johnson & Johnson COVID vaccine with the risk of clotting among some hormonal birth control methods. “The clotting syndrome that is currently being investigated by the FDA and the CDC is likely different from the type of blood clotting experienced with birth control,” she said.

Don’t miss: Johnson & Johnson vaccine pause: What to know if you got or scheduled the shot

Indeed, government health officials are investigating a type of blood clot called a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) among the J&J recipients. These clots formed in the draining veins of the brain, combined with a low platelet count, essentially causing a stroke. Hormonal birth control pills, on the other hand, raise the risk of blood clots in the leg that can break off and travel to the lung, causing a pulmonary embolism that blocks blood flow to part of the lung. The latter clots can be treated with anticoagulants, while the J&J clots cannot.

What’s more, there are many different personal factors that can raise or reduce the risk of developing a blood clot, such as: a family history of clots; high blood pressure; obesity; pregnancy; recent surgery; or recently suffering a fracture.

“Each one of us has different risk factors for the same medical intervention, whether it’s the Johnson & Johnson vaccine or whether it’s taking a birth control pill,” Dr. Gloria Bachmann, an OB-GYN and director of the Women’s Health Institute at Rutgers, told MarketWatch. “And there are benefits for both, and there are risks for both, and that’s where one has to evaluate the risk of this intervention, and what would be the risks of getting COVID.”

“ “The biggest risk at the moment is the COVID virus, not the COVID vaccine.” ” — Dr. Arthur Caplan

Plus, women on the pill are made aware of the risks beforehand, notes Dr. Arthur Caplan, director of NYU Langone’s Division of Medical Ethics. “Some women have suggested maybe people are indifferent to women’s health. I don’t see it that way,” he said. “Women I’ve known on birth control pills are well aware of the risk of clots. People assume the risk, and then decide they’re gonna do it.”

So while it may be helpful to get people to stop panicking about the J&J pause, or reports of rare blood clots among AstraZeneca AZN, -0.18% vaccine recipients, by showing just how many other medications and personal behaviors could be more likely to cause clots, directly comparing the rate of blood clots from birth control with the rate among recipients of COVID vaccines doesn’t really work. “Plus, different birth control pills have different amounts of estrogen and progesterone, and carry different risks of blood clots, so it’s not as simple as making a global statement,” said Bachmann.

Related: The expectation of perfection: Risk of blood clot from Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is 0.00009%

But it does resurface the important subject of what’s considered an acceptable risk in medicine — or in anything, really — and the risk-benefit analysis each one of us makes when we decide to take a medication to treat an ailment despite the possible side effects. And the science shows that the benefits of getting vaccinated against COVID outweigh the small risk of blood clots for most people. And that is similar to taking hormonal birth control pills. Bachmann notes that women on birth control enjoy a reduced risk of ovarian cancer, fewer anemia problems, more regular periods, as well as the prevention of unwanted pregnancies. (Pregnancy actually poses an even greater risk of blood clots than birth control pills, she added.)

In the case of COVID-19, the virus has infected more than 31.5 million Americans and killed more 565,695. Health officials are investigating six cases of severe blood clotting, all women, who received the J&J vaccine, including one who died.

What’s more, some 30% of COVID-19 survivors have reported persistent symptoms like fatigue, brain fog and difficulty breathing still plaguing them nine months later. Plus, a new study from researchers at Oxford University has found that people who contract COVID-19 are at far higher risk of developing blood clots than people who receive COVID vaccines. In fact, the risk of cerebral venous thrombosis after a COVID-19 infection is about 100 times greater than normal, and several times higher than after coronavirus vaccination or after the flu.

Read more: Getting COVID creates far higher risk of rare blood clots than vaccines, Oxford study finds

Meanwhile, 99.992% of fully vaccinated people have avoided getting COVID, CDC data shows.

The bottom line is that the fallout from catching COVID right now far outweighs the small risk of possible side effects from any of the vaccines that have been approved for emergency use authorization in the U.S. Problem is, people aren’t great at “translating risk into action,” as Dr. Andrew Pavia, the George and Esther Gross Presidential Professor at the University of Utah, recently told MarketWatch. Which could explain some conflicting behavior.

“I had someone come up to me today who said, ‘I won’t take that vaccine because it’s dangerous’ — and they smoke two packs [of cigarettes] a day!” Caplan said. Meanwhile, smoking cigarettes can increase the risk of both developing blood clots and suffering severe COVID-19 illness.

He’s among the doctors who fear that pausing J&J will increase vaccine hesitancy in the U.S. In fact, a recent poll conducted by The Economist and YouGov found that only 37% of respondents think that J&J’s vaccine is safe after the pause, compared with 52% who believed it was safe before the pause.

“I think the messaging should have been, ‘While we examine a possible association [with blood clots] that is serious but rare, keep vaccinating,’” he said. “I wouldn’t stop vaccinating myself or anybody in my family because of this possible association. I would not pull away from the Johnson & Johnson vaccine due to a less than one in a million risk of death.”

“The biggest risk at the moment is the COVID virus, not the COVID vaccine,” Caplan added.",1220,7347,14,90
0,8 FedEx employees killed in shooting at Indianapolis facility; suspect also dead,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/shooting-reported-fedex-facility-indianapolis-n1264249,"Eight people were killed after a gunman opened fire at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis late Thursday before killing himself, according to police.

Four others who were shot and another who was injured were taken to hospitals, officials said, adding that some may have been privately transported to medical facilities.

No law enforcement officers were hurt in the shooting carried out by a former employee who last worked at the facility in the fall, authorities said Friday afternoon.

A motive for the attack wasn't immediately clear, but a year ago, the shooter's mother said she feared he might be suicidal.

“In March 2020, the suspect’s mother contacted law enforcement to report he might try to"" attempt ""suicide by cop,"" said FBI Special Agent in Charge Paul Keenan, who runs the bureau's Indianapolis field office.

The phrase ""suicide by cop"" refers to a self-destructive person who intentionally draws the attention of police in hopes of a deadly confrontation.

""A shotgun was seized at his residence. Based on items observed in the suspect’s bedroom at that time, he was interviewed by the FBI in April 2020. No Racially Motivated Violent Extremism (RMVE) ideology was identified during the course of the assessment and no criminal violation was found,"" the statement said. ""The shotgun was not returned to the suspect.”

Law enforcement officials identified him as 19-year-old Brandon Scott Hole.

The shooting was reported shortly after 11 p.m. ET and officers arrived to an active shooter incident, according to police.

""This suspect came to the facility, and when he came there he got out of his car and pretty quickly started some random shooting outside the facility,"" Craig McCartt, deputy chief of criminal investigations for the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, said during a news conference Friday morning.

McCartt said the initial investigation shows there was no disturbance or argument that preceded the shooting, which lasted about two minutes.

The suspected gunman killed himself shortly before police arrived, he said, adding that investigators believe he had a rifle.

Four bodies were found outside the facility, and four more were found inside, McCartt said.

Police said Friday evening that Matthew R. Alexander, 32; Samaria Blackwell, 19; Amarjeet Johal, 66; Jaswinder Kaur, 64; Jaswinder Singh, 68; Amarjit Sekhon, 48; Karli Smith, 19; and John Weisert, 74, were killed in the shooting.

FedEx CEO Frederick W. Smith said the eight killed were company employees.

""This is a devastating day, and words are hard to describe the emotions we all feel,"" he said in a statement.

""I want to express my deepest sympathies to the families, friends, and co-workers of those team members,"" he said, adding that counselors were on site at the facility to provide support.

""We have a team onsite in Indianapolis to provide support, and we are making counselors available. This is a devastating day, and words are hard to describe the emotions we all feel."" Read Frederick W. Smith's letter to team members: https://t.co/hs53dTkax8 — FedEx (@FedEx) April 16, 2021

A FedEx employee told NBC's ""TODAY"" show that he was sitting outside the building when he heard what he initially thought was a car with engine problems. He soon realized the sound was actually gunfire.

""And when I stand up, I see a man — a hooded figure — I was unable to see his face in detail however,"" Levi Miller said.

He said the man had a rifle ""and he started shouting, and then he started firing in random directions."" He couldn't tell what the gunman was yelling. ""I thought he saw me and so I immediately ducked for cover,"" Miller said.

Family members were waiting at a nearby Holiday Inn Express hotel early Friday to hear if their loved ones were safe while police chaplains provided support, WTHR photojournalist Joe Fenton tweeted.

McCartt said there was some frustration in connecting family members with survivors because employees did not have their cellphones on them as they fled the building.

FedEx said in a statement that ""to minimize potential distractions around package sortation equipment and dock operations, cellphone access within certain areas of FedEx Ground field operations is limited to authorized team members.""

Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett offered prayers to ""the families of those whose lives were cut short"" and thanked the ""city’s first responders for their tireless work overnight.""

""Their quick response provided critical aid to those injured in the shooting and brought a measure of calm to an otherwise chaotic scene,"" he said in a tweet.

""What we are left with this morning is grief — grief for the families of those killed, grief for the employees who have lost their co-workers, grief for the many Americans struggling to understand how tragedies like this continue to occur again and again,"" Hogsett said Friday morning.

Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb ordered flags to be flown at half-staff.

""This is another heartbreaking day, and I’m shaken by the mass shooting at the FedEx Ground facility in Indianapolis,"" he said in a statement. ""In times like this, words like justice and sorrow fall short in response for those senselessly taken.""

U.S. Rep. André Carson, D-Indiana, whose district includes Indianapolis, said that he was devastated by the incident.

""I am heartbroken by the mass shooting at the FedEx facility here in Indianapolis and praying for all affected by this tragedy,"" he said on Twitter.

There have been several mass shootings in the United States in recent weeks, including an April 8 shooting at a cabinet company facility in Bryan, Texas, that left one person dead and five others wounded.

This is the third high-profile shooting this year in Indianapolis.

In January, five people, including a pregnant woman, were shot dead in the city's northeast side. And in March, a man fatally shot three adults and a child at a home in a dispute over a stimulus check, police said.

President Joe Biden also ordered flags be lowered to half-staff.

""Last night and into the morning in Indianapolis, yet again families had to wait to hear word about the fate of their loved ones. What a cruel wait and fate that has become too normal and happens every day somewhere in our nation,"" Biden said in a statement.

The shooting ""is just the latest in a string of tragedies, following closely after gunmen firing bullets in broad daylight at spas in and around Atlanta, Georgia, a grocery store in Boulder, Colorado, a home in Rock Hill, South Carolina, and so many other shootings,"" he said.

Last week, Biden announced a series of executive actions aimed at tackling what he called a national ""epidemic.""

""Gun violence is an epidemic in America. But we should not accept it. We must act,"" he said Friday.

His proposals, which are likely to face legal hurdles, are aimed at reducing mass shootings, suicides and domestic violence.

They aim to limit so-called ""ghost guns,"" which can be assembled at home without traceable serial numbers, and make it easier for relatives to flag family members who shouldn't be allowed to buy firearms.

Biden is also seeking to reduce access to stabilizing braces, which can effectively turn a pistol into a more lethal rifle while not being subject to the same regulations that a rifle of similar size would be.

Vice President Kamala Harris said Friday: ""Yet again we have families in America that are grieving the loss of their family members because of gun violence. There is no question this violence must end and we are thinking of the families that lost their loved ones.

Gun violence, in general, has skyrocketed in recent years.

The Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit group that tracks gun violence in the U.S., found that more than 19,000 people died in gun homicides last year. This was the the highest yearly figure in more than two decades, up by nearly 25 percent from 2019.

That’s why we were so moved by the heartwarming story of a man who loved his wife so much that he brought his Xbox Series X to the delivery room so she could watch him play Assassin’s Creed Valhalla while in labor.

Oh gosh, did it just get emotional in here or what? We’re not crying, you are!

The hero of this story is Ben Hughes, a 37-year-old lab technician from Ohio who is clearly husband-of-the-year material—t hat’s because when his wife Linda’s water broke, he was prepared to help her through the process in the way only a true gamer could. In addition to including the necessary toiletries and insurance paperwork in their hospital go-bag, he also packed his Xbox Series X, preloaded with a recent save of Assassin’s Creed. That way, Linda could watch him roam Medieval England as a Viking, fighting off enemies and recruiting new clan members as her cervix dilated and her body prepared itself for the stressful experience of giving birth.

As her contractions became more frequent and she began to push, Ben was there supporting her every step of the way, making sure she had a clear view of his devastating axe combos and upgrade path. That level of partner support is a rare thing to come across, but her husband, in his tender devotion, didn’t even think twice about it.

“I knew this would be a stressful situation for her, so I figured it would be nice if she could watch me play while going through all that stuff,’ said Hughes, explaining his relief to discover there was a free outlet near the hospital room’s infusion pump so he can start playing right away. “She always finds it pretty interesting even though she’s not really into video games.”

“What’s amazing is that I actually managed to complete T he Book of Dragons saga while our son’s head started crowning,” he added, growing visibly emotional at the memory. “I never thought I’d get that far with everything else going on.”



Although Linda is sure lucky to have such a sweetheart of a partner, there were some unfortunate complications during her labor. Because of certain uterine abnormalities, the doctors had to perform an emergency C- section, which was a stressful ordeal, to say the least. Luckily, Ben was by her side the whole time, leveling up Eivor while storming the British Isles.



And thankfully, OGN is proud to report that the Hughes family has given birth to a healthy, 8 -pound baby boy named Charlie—and Ben, meanwhile, has successfully reached 100% completion of Valahalla! Mazel tov!",448,2599,23,129

The first round of talks took place in Baghdad on April 9, included discussions about attacks on Saudi Arabia by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi group, and was positive, the FT reported, citing officials briefed on the discussions.

The report also cited a senior Saudi official, however, denying that any talks had taken place.

The two regional rivals severed ties in 2016 over Riyadh’s execution of Shi’ite Muslim cleric, Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, an outspoken opponent of the ruling Al Saudi family.

Meetings amid new nuclear talks

The talks took place as Washington and Tehran try to revive a 2015 nuclear accord, which Riyadh has objected to.

The US is also pressing for an end to the ongoing conflict in Yemen, which is seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

Riyadh has called for a nuclear pact with stronger parameters and has said that Gulf Arab states should join any negotiations on the accord to ensure that it addresses Tehran's missile program and its support for regional proxies.

Former US President Donald Trump quit the nuclear agreement and reimposed sanctions on Iran in 2018 -- a move that Saudi Arabia and its allies supported.

Iran responded to the sanctions by breaching several restrictions on its nuclear activities.

The nuclear agreement's remaining signatories — Iran, the EU, Germany, France, the UK, Russia and China — have been holding talks in Vienna to pave the way for the US to rejoin.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has also previously indicated that he wants to cool hostilities with Arab rivals.

Iran announces progress on uranium

On Friday, Iran announced that it had started enriching uranium up to 60% purity, in the latest move to boost its nuclear capabilities.

The alleged enrichment level is now at its highest level, and follows a sabotage incident at Iran's Natanz nuclear plant the week prior.

Although 60% enrichment of uranium is a record high for Iran, it is still below the 90% threshold required for nuclear weapons.

The announcement marked a significant escalation of tensions in the Middle East, and casts doubt over the chances of finding a middle ground on the nuclear deal.

The change in enrichment was both an effort to convince other countries to come to the negotiating table and discuss its nuclear program, as well as a response to the act of sabotage at Natanz, which Iran blames on Israel.

Especially in this day and age as more fanboys and girls than ever are seeing their civil liberties infringed upon for peaceful acts like trying to level up their Charmeleon or grab a few extra Power Moons. That’s why we would like to take a moment to remind of one important thing:

If a cop asks you to stop gaming, please remember: You don’t have to.

That’s right. Regardless of how much a police officer might try to pressure you, it is your constitutional right to continue gaming. Whether you’re in the middle of a boss battle in Wolfenstein II or just sprucing up your island in Animal Crossing, as long as you don’t have any warrants out for your arrest and are not trespassing on private property, you are under no obligation to hit pause or put down your controller.

Generations of brave Americans didn’t fight to uphold the Bill of Rights just so some bully in uniform could unceremoniously force you to abandon an important Ghost Of Tsushima quest without saving. This country was founded on the principles of free and open gaming, and we’ll be damned to let those precious, God-given rights be taken away. As Thomas Jefferson once famously said, “Our liberty depends on our freedom to game.”

Always remember that, gamers. Always.

Now, should you find yourself in a situation where a law enforcement agent is asking you to stop gaming, don’t panic. Just stay calm. While keeping your eyes on the screen and your hands on your controller, politely yet firmly say something to this effect: “I do not consent to your request to stop playing video games. I am an American citizen, and it is my right to continue gaming in accordance with my protections under the Fourth Amendment.”

They might say things such as, “Sir, you’re blocking traffic,” or, “Sir, that law doesn’t exist,” or, “Sir, we’re investigating a murder,” in order to pressure you to stop. But never forget that you don’t have to comply with these unlawful requests. As long as you inform them of your gamer rights in a peaceful manner, you are not breaking any laws, state or federal.

WASHINGTON—Declaring that they were closer than ever to reaching a mutually satisfying result, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced Friday a meeting to put the finishing touches on a 1,000-piece ‘ Starry Night’ jigsaw puzzle. “We are pleased that, after months of tense negotiations, we’re on the verge finishing this terrific puzzle of one of Van Gogh’s most critically important works,” said Mnuchin and Pelosi in a joint statement, adding that they had made a major breakthrough in assembling the pieces of the village and hoped the finished puzzle would reflect the enormous amount of work put into it by dozens of members of the Trump administration and Democratic House leadership. “We really want to get his puzzle done before the election, but it’s also important not to rush things and jam pieces of the night sky together that don’t actually fit. It’s true that we hoped to get the puzzle done faster when we started in June, but even working on it day and night, it takes time to assemble so many pieces. There are still some sticking points, like whether a few of the border pieces are lost for good or whether they’re just in a couch cushion somewhere in the Oval Office, but as soon as we find those and finish the cypress tree, we’ll be all ready to present it to the public.” Pelosi and Mnuchin admitted that it still might be hard to reach an agreement with Senate Republicans, who so far had rejected the offers of doing a puzzle entirely and seemed unlikely to agree to anything except a game of Risk.

Citing a report by the National Task Force for West Philippine Sea (NTF-WPS), the Homonhon Environmental Rescue Organization (Hero) said the Chinese ships found around the Union Banks and Pag-asa Islands were at least 60 meters in length and each capable of catching at least 1 ton of fish every day.

“The Chinese fishermen have been overfishing, depleting our marine resources,” said Villardo Abuene, Hero president, in a statement.

“They even sell their catch to our fishermen at a higher price,” Abuerne said.

Even some fishermen in Zambales province have reportedly stopped going to the Scarborough Shoal, a known rich traditional fishing ground of Filipinos in the West Philippine Sea, due to depleting fish catch in the area.

In the past years, fishermen in the province had been driven away from the contested shoal by Chinese coast guards and some Chinese fishing vessels.

“This is actually worse than invasion,” Abuerne said.

“Our fishermen are starving. They face hunger because of the Chinese,” he added.

Abueme has called on the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources to investigate China’s overfishing in the West Philippine Sea.

On Wednesday, the NTF-WPS said an estimated 240 Chinese vessels were seen spread throughout the West Philippine Sea during its latest sovereignty patrols last April 11.

The tip line allows people to report fellow netizens who ""distort"" the Party's history, attack its leadership and policies, defame national heroes and ""deny the excellence of advanced socialist culture"" online, said a notice posted by an arm of the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) on Friday.

""Some with ulterior motives ... have been spreading historical nihilistic misrepresentations online, maliciously distorting, denigrating and negating the history of the Party,"" said the notice.

""We hope that the majority of Internet users will actively play their part in supervising society ... and enthusiastically report harmful information,"" it said.

""Historical nihilism"" is a phrase used in China to describe public doubt and scepticism over the Chinese Communist Party's description of past events.

China's internet is tightly censored and most foreign social media networks, search engines and news outlets are banned in the country.

Internet authorities often increase censorship and online supervision ahead of major events including historical anniversaries, political meetings and sports events.

The notice did not specify what punishments would be dealt to people who are reported through the hotline, but netizens in China already face jail time and other legal punishments for posting content that is critical of the county's leadership, policies and history.

Legal amendments released earlier this year stipulate that people who ""insult, slander of infringe upon"" the memory of China's national heroes and martyrs face jail time of up to three years.

Last week, authorities in the eastern Chinese province of Jiangsu detained a 19-year-old man after making ""insulting"" comments online about Japan's 1937 occupation of Nanjing.

Chinese social media sites that fail to censor critical content also face financial sanctions as well as temporary suspensions of service under current law.

0,Tens of thousands flee attacks on northeast Nigerian town: UN,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/16/thousands-flee-attacks-on-northeast-nigerian-town-un,"UN says tens of thousands have fled a series of attacks this week by an armed group on the town of Damasak, Borno state.

As many as 65,000 people have fled the northeastern Nigerian town of Damasak following a series of attacks by an armed group, the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) said.

Fighters from the so-called Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) stormed the town in Borno state three times in a week to strike a military garrison, burning homes and a UN office, and killing at least 12 people, the UNHCR said on Friday.

In the latest violence on Wednesday, the fighters attacked the garrison before being forced back into the town itself, military sources and residents said.

“Following the latest attack on Wednesday 14 April, the third in seven days, up to 80 percent of the town’s population – which includes the local community and internally displaced people – were forced to flee,” UNHCR spokesman Babar Baloch said.

Some have fled towards the regional capital, Maiduguri, and other nearby towns while others have crossed the border into Niger’s Diffa region, itself vulnerable to violence from armed groups.

“Due to insecurity, however, humanitarian access is increasingly challenging in many parts of Nigeria’s Borno State, including for UNHCR staff, who were forced to temporarily relocate out of Damasak in the past seven days,” Baloch said.

Jens Laerke, spokesman for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), told the same briefing that aid operations had been temporarily suspended in the area since Sunday because of the insecurity.

“The situation on the ground is extremely critical and if this continues it will be impossible, maybe for longer periods of time, for us to deliver aid to those who desperately need it,” he said.

Laerke added that humanitarian workers appeared to be targets, amid reports of house-to-house searches for aid workers and the burning of their offices.

The incidents mark the latest violence in the Lake Chad basin area which in recent years has uprooted some 3.3 million people, the refugee agency said.

Damasak is host to one of the military’s so-called “super camps” – fortified garrisons the army has set up in an attempt to better defend against attacks.

Critics and residents say the strategy to close smaller bases and pull back into larger camps has left armed groups freer to roam unchallenged in rural areas.

Due to worsening security in the region, humanitarian workers are struggling to provide aid, with the number of people requiring urgent assistance expected to rise to 8.7 million this year.

REUTERS/Baz Ratner/File Photo

Eritrea told the United Nations Security Council on Friday that it has agreed to start withdrawing its troops from Ethiopia's Tigray region, acknowledging publicly for the first time the country's involvement in the conflict.

The admission in a letter to the 15-member council - and posted online by Eritrea's Ministry of Information - comes a day after U.N. aid chief Mark Lowcock said the world body had not seen any proof that Eritrean soldiers have withdrawn.

""As the looming grave threat has been largely thwarted, Eritrea and Ethiopia have agreed - at the highest levels - to embark on the withdrawal of Eritrean forces and the simultaneous redeployment of Ethiopian contingents along the international boundary,"" Eritrea's U.N. Ambassador Sophia Tesfamariam wrote.

Eritrean forces have been helping Ethiopian federal government troops fight Tigray's former ruling party in a conflict that began in November. However, until now Eritrea has repeatedly denied its forces are in the mountainous region.

Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed last month acknowledged the Eritrean presence and the United Nations and the United States have demanded that Eritrean troops withdraw from Tigray.

""Neither the U.N. nor any of the humanitarian agencies we work with have seen proof of Eritrean withdrawal,"" Lowcock told the Security Council on Thursday. ""We have, however, heard some reports of Eritrean soldiers now wearing Ethiopian Defense Force uniforms."" read more

The conflict has killed thousands of people and forced hundreds of thousands more from their homes in the region of 5 million.

Lowcock said there were ""widespread and corroborated reports of Eritrean culpability in massacres and killings."" Eritrean soldiers opened fire in an Ethiopian town on Monday, killing at least nine civilians and wounding more than a dozen others, a local government official told Reuters.

The Security Council has been briefed privately five times since the conflict began. According to Lowcock's briefing notes on Thursday, he told the body that sexual violence is being used as a weapon of war, the humanitarian crisis has deteriorated in the past month and people are now dying of hunger in Tigray.

""We heard false allegations of the 'the use of sexual violence and hunger as a weapon',"" Tesfamariam wrote on Friday. ""The allegations of rape and other crimes lodged against Eritrean soldiers is not just outrageous, but also a vicious attack on the culture and history of our people.""

She said the priority should be the delivery of aid to civilians in Tigray.

The man, whose identity was withheld, was able to lower his fine to €100 (around $120 or P5,800), as per Austrian newspaper Der Standard earlier this month as cited by The Local on April 9.

ADVERTISEMENT

In challenging the fine, the man argued in court that farting is a “biological process” that even if intentional, it would amount to freedom of expression.

The Vienna Regional Administrative Court did not remove his fine, although it was lowered as the court acknowledged the man’s clean record and financial status. He was described to have only had “average” culpability of the offense, according to the report.

In the ruling, the court recalled that the farting incident occurred in June last year while he was sitting on a bench at a park, hanging out with friends.

The man, who was referred to only as Mr. AB in court documents, and his group were approached by police officers for a routine identity check, Vice reported in detail on April 14, also citing Der Standard.

“When he released the intestinal gas, the complainant was sitting on a park bench,” the document was quoted as stating. “He then lifted his buttocks and tensed up a little before letting the intestinal gas escape.”

“The complainant’s friends laughed at the intestinal gas and witness F made a joke. Due to the resulting entertainment from the intestinal gas, the defendant grinned at the officers,” it added.

While the judge did not approve of his argument and just lowered the fine to €100, Mr. AB’s lawyer, Matej Zenz, told local Viennese newspaper Kurier that they would appeal the decision before the country’s constitutional court.

Zenz maintained that it is “a matter of principle” to them, stressing that it is “petty to get a punishment for a fart.”

The court argues, however, that this specific farting incident is not a case of “pure body stimuli” as it was done so in a “form of expression that transcends the boundaries of decency,” The Local reported, citing Der Standard. Ian Biong /ra

The European Court of Justice dismissed a Dutch challenge arguing that the EU didn’t take the latest scientific evidence into account when it took the decision two years ago.

The decision will specifically hit the Dutch fishing fleet, which has invested strongly in electric pulse fishing. They argue the technique is environmentally friendly because it allows trawlers to use far less diesel and doesn’t damage the seabed.

Over 80 of the Dutch fleet’s 137 trawlers are equipped for pulse fishing.

Opponents characterize the method as industrial fishing that is wiping out fish stocks.

“The court dismisses the action brought by the Netherlands in its entirety,” the ECJ said in a statement.

REUTERS/Jorge Silva

China's Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine was 67% effective in preventing symptomatic infection, data from a huge real-world study inChile has shown, a potential boost for the jab which has come under scrutiny over its level of protection against the virus.

The CoronaVac vaccine was 85% effective in preventing hospitalizations and 80% effective in preventing deaths, the Chilean government said in a report, adding that the data should prove a ""game changer"" from the vaccine more widely.

Rodrigo Yanez, Chile's vice trade minister who forged a deal with Sinovac to host the drug's clinical trial and buy 60 million doses of the drug over three years, said the results showed Chile had made ""the right bet"".

""It's a game changer for that vaccine and I think it ratifies quite graphically the discussion over its efficacy,"" he told Reuters, adding it should help it with approvals with the World Health Organization as the first real-world study.

Chile's stock of CoronaVac is running low, with the supply of an agreed total of 14.2 million to be fully delivered by late May. Yanez said he was negotiating an additional 4 million doses of the vaccine and for now, the country will switch to using more of the Pfizer-BioNTech (PFE.N), (22UAy.DE) doses it is due.

The release of the CoronaVac data makes Chile one of a handful of countries, including Britain and Israel, that have used their rapid inoculation campaigns to gather insights into how effective vaccines are outside controlled clinical trials and when faced with unpredictable variables in societies.

Israel's real-world study of the effectiveness of Pfizer's vaccine looked at the results among 1.2 million people, a mix of those who received the shot and those who did not.

Chile's study examined CoronaVac's effectiveness among 10.5 million people, again looking both at people who had been vaccinated and those who had not. Vaccines were administered approximately 28 days apart.

The CoronaVac data published by Chile compares favorably with previous data released on its efficacy in clinical trials.

Brazilian trials have indicated general efficacy of the drug at preventing symptomatic infection at just above 50%, though shower far higher efficacy at preventing hospitalization and against moderate and severe cases.

Indonesia gave the vaccine emergency-use approval based on interim data showing it was 65% effective, while in a Turkish trial it had an efficacy in preventing symptomatic infection of 83.5% and 100% in preventing severe illness and hospitalization.

The Chilean study looked at the impact of the vaccine among people in the public health system between Feb. 2-April 1, adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, income and nationality.

Its authors stressed that its results, for example a lower protection against death than in clinical trials, should be considered against the backdrop of a fierce second wave of the pandemic.

It compared people who were not inoculated, individuals 14 days or more after receiving one dose and more than 14 days after receiving a second dose. Protection against the virus was far higher after the second shot.

Rafael Araos, the Chilean public health official who presented the study, said the report did not specifically look at how the vaccine stood up to coronavirus variants, including the P1 mutant first identified in Brazil.

""The study was done during a period of high circulation of the virus, including of the variants - so these results are positive if we don't have variants and also if we do,"" he said.

An Italian judge has ordered that Matteo Salvini, leader of the far-right League party, must stand trial on charges of kidnapping over his decision to prevent more than 100 refugees and migrants on a rescue ship from landing in the country in 2019.

Salvini, who was interior minister and deputy prime minister at that time, left the people stranded at sea until prosecutors ordered the seizure of the ship and the evacuation of the people on board.

The trial will begin in the southern city of Palermo on September 15.

Proactiva Open Arms, the Spanish NGO which operated the Open Arms rescue ship at the heart of the case, welcomed the judge’s ruling.

“Violating a fundamental right such as the protection of human beings at sea for the sake of political propaganda is shameful,” said its founder Oscar Camps, adding that the trial would be “an opportunity to judge a period of European history”.

During the standoff, some of the people threw themselves overboard in desperation as the captain pleaded for a safe, close port. Eventually after a 19-day ordeal, the remaining 83 people still on board were allowed to disembark in Lampedusa.

Salvini, who has built much of his political fortune on an anti-immigration campaign, could face up to 15 years in prison if found guilty at the end of a tortuous, three-stage judicial process.

A definitive conviction could bar him from government office.

“I am going to trial with my head held high, in your name as well as mine. Italy first, always,” Salvini tweeted immediately after the ruling.

“Defending our country is a citizen’s sacred duty … that is what I am being tried for.”

During his 14 months as interior minister, Salvini stopped several boats from docking in Italy in an effort to halt migrant flows, and regularly accused the charities that operated them of effectively encouraging people smuggling.

He withdrew the League from the coalition government in the summer of 2019 in a failed bid to trigger an election when his party was riding high in the polls.

The League, now part of Mario Draghi’s two-month-old national unity government, has lost more than 10 points of voter support but remains the most popular party in Italy on about 23 percent, according to most opinion polls.

Salvini is also under investigation for another, similar standoff involving the Italian coastguard ship Gregoretti that Salvini refused to let dock in the summer of 2019.

The prosecutor in that case, Catania, Sicily prosecutor Andrea Bonomo, recommended last week that Salvini not be put on trial, arguing that he was carrying out government policy when he kept the 116 migrants at sea for five days.",461,2760,9,59
0,Vietnam calls for faster vaccine rollout before shots expire,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/04/17/asia-pacific/vietnam-vaccine-expire/,"Vietnam’s health ministry called for the acceleration of its COVID-19 vaccine rollout on Friday as the expiry date of the Southeast Asian country’s first batch of jabs supplied through the COVAX program fast approaches.

Since it began its vaccination program last month, Vietnam has inoculated around 73,000 people despite receiving nearly 1 million AstraZeneca doses, 800,000 of which were obtained via the COVAX vaccine-sharing program.

“The (AstraZeneca) COVID-19 vaccine has a shelf life of 6 months but the batch delivered to Vietnam on April 1 under the COVAX scheme only has two months left till expiration,” the ministry said in a statement Friday.

“We have to speed up the inoculation. It is not acceptable that a single dose of the vaccine is thrown out because of a failure in the rollout,” the statement added.

The health ministry requested all 19 localities which have started vaccine programs to finish no later than May 5, 26 days before the vaccines expire.

Vietnam has been praised globally for its record containing the virus through targeted mass testing and a strict, centralized quarantine program.

The country has kept its tally of cases to 2,800, and reported only 35 deaths since the pandemic began. Authorities are aiming to immunize 70% of Vietnam’s population and are seeking to obtain a total of 150 million vaccine doses through direct purchases and via COVAX.

The health ministry said Vietnam had carried out its vaccination campaign at a higher safety level than the World Health Organization’s recommendation but that safety should not be the reason for a slow vaccine rollout.

The ministry did not immediately respond to emailed questions from Reuters regarding the slow progress of the program.

Four Vietnamese companies are engaged in vaccine research and production, two of which are at the human trial stage.

0,Statement on France’s deportation of Chechen asylum seeker Magamed Gadaev to Russia despite risk of torture,https://www.iphronline.org/statement-on-france-s-deportation-of-chechen-asylum-seeker-magamed-gadaev-to-russia-despite-risk-of-torture.html,"Chechen police abducted Magomed Gadaev, an asylum seeker from Chechnya, in the Russian Federation, and a key witness in a high-profile torture investigation against Chechnya’s authorities, two days after he was wrongfully deported from France to Russia on 9 April. Chechen police continue to hold him in custody. Twelve Russian and international human rights organizations said that Gadaev is at high risk of torture, as a result of the actions by the French, Russian and Chechen authorities which violated international human rights law.

French authorities outrageously proceeded with Gadaev’s expulsion despite the decision by the national asylum court prohibiting his expulsion if it meant his return to Russia due to substantiated fears for his life and safety. French authorities’ actions have put him at immediate risk of torture and other ill-treatment and exposed him to a grave danger to his life, in flagrant violation of France’s international obligations prohibiting the return of any person, whatever the circumstances, to a territory where they are at risk of serious human rights violations. This prohibition is a non-derogable norm of international law and is affirmed by numerous human rights treaties ratified by France.

On 10 March, the national asylum court issued a ruling that the authorities should not expel Gadaev if it would mean he was returned to Russia because it would likely expose him to harm. But on the morning of 9 April, French authorities forcibly put Gadaev on a flight from Paris to Moscow. On arrival in Moscow, Russian border guards held Gadaev at Shemetyevo airport’s transit zone for over 12 hours, denying him access to his lawyer, Semyon Tsvetkov.

According to Tsvetkov, he repeatedly inquired with the border guards why they were holding Gadaev, who was not on a wanted list in Russia. A border officer hinted to the lawyer about an “agreement” to put Gadaev on a flight to Grozny, Chechnya’s capital, but he did not answer Tsvetkov’s questions as to who “agreed” to this, and on what basis.

In his conversation with border officials, Tsvektov emphasized that Gadaev did not want to be transferred to Chechnya, where his life would be in danger. Finally, after hours of negotiations, the border guards consented to put Gadaev on a flight to Novy Urengoi, a town in the far north of Russia where his close relatives reside. Fearing for his client’s safety, Tsvetkov boarded the same flight. Gadaev and Tsvetkov arrived in Novy Urengoi on 10 April. According to his family members, soon after the flight landed, two Chechens apparently linked with Chechnya’s authorities came to the home of Gadaev’s relatives demanding to see Gadaev and threatening the family with retaliation if they refused to cooperate.

Shortly afterwards, Gadaev and Tsvetkov noticed surveillance of the apartment building where they were staying and received an informal warning from sources in Chechnya that Chechen police were on their way to Novy Urengoi to detain Gadaev. They went to the police station, reported the threats and apparent surveillance to the Novy Urengoi police, and asked for protection. After filing the report, they wanted to leave Novy Urengoi immediately. However the police argued that in the interests of their safety they should either stay at the station or return to the apartment and they would post several police officers there to ensure their security. They opted for the latter.

On 11 April, at around 13:00 local time, the police asked Gadaev and Tsvetkov to go to the local office of Russia’s Investigative Committee to complete some paperwork connected to the report they filed. However, as soon as they left the apartment building, men who failed to identify themselves but whom Tsvetkov believes to have been Chechen law enforcement officials in plain clothes forced Gadaev into a car. When Tsvetkov attempted to get into the car as well, one of the men pushed him away and said they were taking Gadaev with them and that Tsvetkov should go to the police station where the police would provide relevant information. The local uniformed police officers present at the scene did not intervene.

When Tsvetkov arrived at the station, police told him they knew nothing about Gadaev’s whereabouts or the identity of those who took him away. Later, the police informally suggested to Tsvetkov that Gadaev may have been detained in connection with a criminal investigation in Chechnya.

The manner in which the Chechen men took Gadaev bears all the hallmarks of an abduction-style detention. The course of events strongly suggests that the police in Novy Urengoi acted in collusion with the Chechen police by making sure Gadaev remained in the city until the arrival of law enforcement officers from Chechnya and then effectively handed him over to them in violation of due process.

On 12 April, Tsvetkov travelled to Grozny seeking information about his client. The police and the prosecutor’s office claimed they were not aware of the case. However, according to Gadaev’s family members, on the morning of 13 April, Chechen security officials brought him to his parents’ home in the village of Zakan-Yurt to speak briefly with his mother. Gadaev was not visibly hurt. The officers did not explain why they were holding him and quickly led him away, telling his mother that he would not come to harm.

Before his detention Gadaev had repeatedly told Tsvetkov and his relatives that in the event that Chechen authorities detain him and then present a written confession to any crime, it could only mean that the confession had been coerced under torture.

At around 18:00 Moscow time, Tsvetkov finally learned that Gadaev was being held at the Urus-Martan police department. The officer on duty at the gate of the compound confirmed this to Tsvetkov but did not let the lawyer gain access to his client and did not provide any information as to Gadaev’s status in custody or if there were any charges against him.

On 14 April, Tsvetkov finally saw Gadaev at the Urus-Martan police department. Gadaev looked subdued, although visibly unharmed, and told Tsvetkov that he no longer needed his services and already had another lawyer representing him. He also made a written a statement confirming this, but the police did not provide a copy to Tsvetkov. Based on a conversation between police officers, which Tsvetkov overheard, he learnt that Gadaev was to be placed under arrest on charges of illegal possession and circulation of arms (Article 222 of Russia’s Criminal Code) and would be jailed in Grozny pending trial.

There are strong grounds for concern that Gadaev refused the services of his trusted lawyer under duress. He remains at imminent risk of torture and other ill-treatment, and his life is in danger. Torture in Chechnya is widespread. Gadaev is also at risk of an unfair trial.

We also note with great concern that in the months following last year’s horrific murder of Samuel Paty, a teacher in a town on the outskirts of Paris, by 18-year-old Chechen refugee Abdullakh Anzorov, the number of Chechen asylum seekers being deported from France has been on the rise. According to Comité Tchétchénie, a French non-governmental group working to stop human rights abuses in Chechnya, between November 2020 and April 2021, the French authorities deported at least eight asylum seekers of Chechen origin, including Gadaev, to Russia. Two of them – Ilyas Sadulaev, deported from France on 12 March, and Lezi Artsuev, deported from France on 5 April – have disappeared upon return to Russia.

What happened to Gadaev immediately after his return to Russia provides one more stark example of the lack of internal flight alternative elsewhere in the territory of the Russian Federation for asylum seekers from Chechnya.

The French authorities should urgently liaise with the Russian authorities regarding Gadaev’s case to ensure that he does not suffer any violation of his rights, including his rights to life, to be free from torture, to liberty and security, to a remedy and protection of the law and, if he is facing charges, to a fair trial.

As Gadaev’s deportation was conducted in violation of international law and contrary to the ruling of the national asylum court, the French authorities should also take immediate steps to enable Gadaev’s return to France. The French authorities should suspend all pending deportations and extraditions to Russia of Chechens who face a well-founded risk of torture and instead take meaningful steps to provide them with international protection.

Brief overview of Magomed Gadaev’s case

Magomed Gadaev, 37, suffered arbitrary detention and torture from November 2009 to April 2010 in an unlawful detention facility located in a basement on the riot police (OMON) compound in Chechnya. Upon his release, he provided witness testimony about torture and extrajudicial executions perpetrated by the police officers, as part of an official criminal investigation into the abduction and torture of Islam Umarpashaev – another man arbitrarily detained in the same basement. Russian authorities opened the case as a result of relentless efforts by one of Russia’s leading independent human rights organizations, the Committee Against Torture. However, in spite of powerful evidence, none of the perpetrators has been brought to justice.

Fearing for his life because of threats of retaliation by Chechen authorities, Gadaev fled Russia in 2010, initially for Poland. In 2012, Polish authorities granted him asylum, but he continued to receive phone calls and messages, including from the police officers who had tortured him, with death threats and demands that he withdraw his testimony. As those who threatened him were aware of his whereabouts, Gadayev did not feel safe in Poland. In September 2012, he travelled from Poland to France and asked for asylum there. His asylum request and subsequent appeals were rejected, primarily on the grounds that he already had refugee status in Poland. In 2019, French authorities attempted to deport him to Poland, but the Polish government informed them that they had just revoked his refugee status.

In April 2019, French authorities ordered Gadaev to leave for Russia, his country of citizenship, but in June an administrative tribunal prohibited his deportation to Russia. Gadaev filed another asylum request, emphasizing that Poland no longer recognized him as a refugee. In October 2019, the French Office for Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons (OFPRA) refused to review his application, alleging that his presence in France threatened “national security” but providing no detail. In November, Gadaev appealed that decision, and his appeal is currently pending, with the hearing scheduled for April 28.

In December, police authorities ordered Gadaev to leave France and proceed to Poland, citing the OFPRA decision he was in process of appealing. He immediately appealed the police order in an administrative court, but the court rejected his appeal.

Gadaev then filed an application with the French National Court of Asylum. In a ruling dated 10 March, the court ruled that Gadaev could not be deported to Russia as it would put his life and physical security at risk and he could not be sent to Poland as Polish authorities were not providing any guarantees of protection nor that they would refrain from sending him to Russia. The court specifically stated that the executive authorities should not take any steps with regard to Gadaev while his appeal of the OFPRA decision was pending.

However, on 8 April, police authorities seized Gadaev, despite the court’s ruling, and the next day forcibly put him on a Moscow-bound flight, denying him access to his French lawyer during the time he spent in custody.",1904,11782,16,107
0,Russia expels US diplomats in retaliation for US sanctions,https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/304509,"Russia on Friday announced it would expel 10 US diplomats and take other retaliatory moves in response to sanctions imposed on Russia by US President Joe Biden a day earlier, The Associated Press reports.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also said Moscow will add eight US officials to its sanctions list and move to restrict and stop the activities of US nongovernment organizations from interfering in Russia’s politics.

He said the Kremlin suggested that US Ambassador John Sullivan follow the example of his Russian counterpart and head home for consultations.

The moves follow the sanctions on Russia announced this week by the Biden administration.

Lavrov noted that while Russia could take “painful measures” against American business interests in Russia, it wouldn’t immediately move to do that

The US on Thursday ordered 10 Russian diplomats expelled, targeted dozens of companies and people, and imposed new curbs on Russia’s ability to borrow money.

Biden later said that he is “prepared to take further actions” if Russia continues to interfere in US democracy.

“I was clear with President Putin that we could have gone further, but I chose not to do so, I chose to be proportionate,” Biden said of the measures, adding that he did not want to “kick off a cycle of escalation and conflict with Russia.”

The US intelligence community said in a landmark report last month that the Russian government meddled in the 2020 election with an influence campaign ""denigrating"" President Joe Biden and ""supporting"" former President Donald Trump.

In mid-December it was reported that a group of hackers backed by a “foreign government” stole information from the US Treasury Department and the Commerce Department’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).

Subsequently it was revealed that the attack also targeted the US Department of Homeland Security.

US intelligence later said that Russia was likely behind those hacking attacks.

Russia has long brushed off allegations of meddling in US elections, human rights abuses, cyberattacks as well as reports of placing bounties on US troops serving in Afghanistan.

Moscow described Biden’s moves on Thursday as a blow to bilateral relations and vowed to impose swift retaliatory measures.

The Kremlin also blamed the United States for weakening the diplomatic relations between Washington and Moscow.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Weizhi Ji/Kunming University of Science and Technology Weizhi Ji/Kunming University of Science and Technology

For the first time, scientists have created embryos that are a mix of human and monkey cells.

The embryos, described Thursday in the journal Cell, were created in part to try to find new ways to produce organs for people who need transplants, said the international team of scientists who collaborated in the work. But the research raises a variety of concerns.

""My first question is: Why?"" said Kirstin Matthews, a fellow for science and technology at Rice University's Baker Institute. ""I think the public is going to be concerned, and I am as well, that we're just kind of pushing forward with science without having a proper conversation about what we should or should not do.""

Still, the scientists who conducted the research, and some other bioethicists defended the experiment.

""This is one of the major problems in medicine — organ transplantation,"" said Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, a professor in the Gene Expression Laboratory of the Salk Institute for Biological Sciences in La Jolla, Calif., and a co-author of the Cell study. ""The demand for that is much higher than the supply.""

""I don't see this type of research being ethically problematic,"" said Insoo Hyun, a bioethicist at Case Western Reserve University and Harvard University. ""It's aimed at lofty humanitarian goals.""

Thousands of people die every year in the United States waiting for an organ transplant, Hyun noted. So, in recent years, some researchers in the U.S. and beyond have been injecting human stem cells into sheep and pig embryos to see if they might eventually grow human organs in such animals for transplantation.

But so far, that approach hasn't worked. So Belmonte teamed up with scientists in China and elsewhere to try something different. The researchers injected 25 cells known as induced pluripotent stem cells from humans — commonly called iPS cells — into embryos from macaque monkeys, which are much more closely genetically related to humans than are sheep and pigs.

After one day, the researchers reported, they were able to detect human cells growing in 132 of the embryos and were able study the embryos for up to 19 days. That enabled the scientists to learn more about how animal cells and human cells communicate, an important step toward eventually helping researchers find new ways to grow organs for transplantation in other animals, Belmonte said.

""This knowledge will allow us to go back now and try to re-engineer these pathways that are successful for allowing appropriate development of human cells in these other animals,"" Belmonte told NPR. ""We are very, very excited.""

Such mixed-species embryos are known as chimeras, named for the fire-breathing creature from Greek mythology that is part lion, part goat and part snake.

""Our goal is not to generate any new organism, any monster,"" Belmonte said. ""And we are not doing anything like that. We are trying to understand how cells from different organisms communicate with one another.""

In addition, Belmonte said he hopes this kind of work could lead to new insights into early human development, aging and the underlying causes of cancer and other disease.

Some other scientists NPR spoke with agree the research could be useful.

""This work is an important step that provides very compelling evidence that someday when we understand fully what the process is we could make them develop into a heart or a kidney or lungs,"" said Dr. Jeffrey Platt, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Michigan, who is doing related experiments but was not involved in the new research.



But this type of scientific work and the possibilities it opens up raises serious questions for some ethicists. The biggest concern, they said, is that someone could try to take this work further and attempt to make a baby out of an embryo made this way. Specifically, the critics worry that human cells could become part of the developing brain of such an embryo — and of the brain of the resulting animal.

""Should it be regulated as human because it has a significant proportion of human cells in it? Or should it be regulated just as an animal? Or something else?"" Rice University's Matthews said. ""At what point are you taking something and using it for organs when it actually is starting to think and have logic?""



Another concern is that using human cells in this way could produce animals that have human sperm or eggs.

""Nobody really wants monkeys walking around with human eggs and human sperm inside them,"" said Hank Greely, a Stanford University bioethicist who co-wrote an article in the same issue of the journal that critiques the line of research while noting that this particular study was ethically done. ""Because if a monkey with human sperm meets a monkey with human eggs, nobody wants a human embryo inside a monkey's uterus.""

Belmonte acknowledges the ethical concerns. But he stresses that his team has no intention of trying to create animals with the part-human, part-monkey embryos, or even to try to grow human organs in such a closely related species. He said his team consulted closely with bioethicists, including Greely.

Greely said he hopes the work will spur a more general debate about how far scientists should be allowed to go with this kind of research.

""I don't think we're on the edge of beyond the Planet of the Apes. I think rogue scientists are few and far between. But they're not zero,"" Greely said. ""So I do think it's an appropriate time for us to start thinking about, 'Should we ever let these go beyond a petri dish?' ""

For several years, the National Institutes of Health has been weighing the idea of lifting a ban on funding for this kind of research but has been waiting for new guidelines, which are expected to come out next month, from the International Society for Stem Cell Research.

The notion of using organs from animals for transplants has also long raised concerns about spreading viruses from animals to humans. So, if the current research comes to fruition, steps would have to be taken to reduce that infection risk, scientists said, such as carefully sequestering animals used for that purpose and screening any organs used for transplantation.",1066,6412,10,64
1,Tough: The New TMNT Game Follows A European Trip Where The Turtles Realize Their Fervent Italian-American Pride Has Little In Common With Modern Italian Life,https://ogn.theonion.com/tough-the-new-tmnt-game-follows-a-european-trip-where-1846600138,"When publisher Dotemu announced they were coming out with an all-new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game, everyone on our staff was over the moon imagining our favorite mutant fighters once again hitting the mean streets of New York to brawl it out with archenemies like Krang or Beebop and maybe even scrounge up a slice or two. Unfortunately, our excitement has been tempered by the developer’s recent announcement that the new side-scroller centers around a European trip where the turtles realize their fervent Italian-American pride has little in common with modern Italian life.

Oof, sorry, gamers. While Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge is a welcome return to form for the heroes on the half shell, it’s hard not to feel bummed out as the four turtles realize their strong personal and cultural connection to Italy is almost a complete fantasy predicated on their affinity for The Sopranos and marinara sauce.



“The Turtles run into a snag early on when Michelangelo tries to order a chicken parmesan sandwich at a trattoria near their hotel only to be informed that that’s not an authentic Italian dish,” said Philip Stephens, lead developer at Dotemu, noting that the consternation of the turtles is compounded by their near-complete lack of Italian language abilities outside of rudimentary phrases. “From there, it only gets worse as they must reckon with seatless toilets and a lack of air conditioning at most establishments that aren’t in line with their romanticized version of Italy.”

In our playthrough, things picked up slightly after Donatello gets pickpocketed during an architecture tour and the Turtles hunt down the thief in the unfamiliar Parioli neighborhood. There, they attempt to bond with locals over a shared love of pizza, the films of Francis Ford Coppola, and Michelangelo’s bicep tattoo of the Italian flag, only to be met with skepticism and even derision by those who consider the quartet to be little more than American tourists.

Despite the game’s intuitive design and old-school sprite graphics—likely to excite any longtime Turtles fan—the game is dragged down by the melancholy of innocence lost, culminating with Raphael getting drunk on Bellinis and screaming at Leonardo for refusing to let April O’Neil come along since her Irish heritage would preclude her from “really understanding” what it means to be Italian.

Fans might also be surprised that most of the game’s finale takes place at a McDonald’s near the Colosseum, where the exhausted turtles send texts and photos to Splinter to convince him that they are having the time of their lives. What’s even more surprised that Shredder’s titular “revenge” appears to be not a nefarious doomsday plot, but merely the dawning comprehension that almost nothing in life will ever satisfy our inflated expectations.



Nonetheless, despite uneven gameplay and a rocky narrative, Shredder’s Revenge has one of the most satisfying conclusions we’ve seen in years, as the turtles begin boarding their flight to LaGuardia full of stories from their time aboard, and they realize there’s no right or wrong way to be Italian.

1,Supreme Court Overturns 'Right v. Wrong',https://www.theonion.com/supreme-court-overturns-right-v-wrong-1819573211,"Justice Scalia said of the decision, ""As long as I am on the bench, I will always fight for what is wrong.""

WASHINGTON—Striking down the judicial precedent that established the legal supremacy of right over wrong more than two centuries ago, the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday overturned Right v. Wrong.

Advertisement

The landmark reversal—a bitterly contested 5-4 decision that has been widely praised by murderers, rapists, bigots, usurers, and pro-wrong advocates nationwide—nullifies all previously lawful forms of right and makes it very difficult for Americans to make ethical decisions or be generally decent human beings without facing criminal charges.

""It is the opinion of this court that the Constitution was crafted in such a manner as to uphold and encourage practices that are not right and, ideally, are very wrong,"" Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the majority, which also in­cluded Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Anthony Kennedy, and John Roberts. ""Despite the compelling case for goodness, truth, and justice made by our predecessors in the case of Right v. Wrong, we firmly believe that malice, dishonesty, and injustice were the framers' original intent.""

""The ruling today rights an age-old wrong in which right has consistently, and unconstitutionally, prevailed,"" Justice Alito wrote in a concurring opinion, adding that the decision between right and wrong did not present a difficult choice for him. ""It is clear the earlier court erred when issuing the Right decision.""

The ruling in Right v. Wrong was handed down in 1790 by the Supreme Court's six original members, all of whom sided with the plaintiff, prompting Chief Justice John Jay to write, ""It is the emphatic province and duty of this highest judicial tribunal to rule in favor of Right, as the argument in support of Right is the right one, and the argument in support of Wrong is the wrong one.""

Since that time, the verdict has been cited in most legal rulings at the state and federal level, and has been upheld by the Supreme Court numerous times, most notably in a 1974 opinion overturning a Six Circuit Court of Appeals decision that would have re-segregated the nation's schools, abolished the minimum wage, legalized evil, and allowed law enforcement officials to conduct searches and seizures without a warrant.

This term, the high court agreed to hear the appeal of an Arizona state judge's ruling for the defendant in the case of Good v. Bad, a decision that had once more called into question the basic tenets of Right v. Wrong.

""If you look at the current makeup of the court, the verdict is hardly surprising,"" said law professor Erwin Chemerinsky, adding that given recent decisions to permit unlimited corporate spending in electoral politics, crack down on civil liberties, and allow the execution of Troy Davis to proceed, he believed the justices had been angling to do away with Right for some time. ""It's long been clear Roberts and Alito were in the camp favoring wrong, and Scalia's passionate criticism of the Right decision almost certainly swayed Justice Kennedy.""

""As for Justice Thomas, he was practically asleep when the attorneys representing Good gave their oral arguments,"" Chemerinsky added. ""In terms of his job, that was definitely the wrong thing to do, so he made it pretty clear which side he was on.""

Many constitutional scholars have argued the ruling sets a dangerous precedent whereby violent criminals could conceivably appeal their convictions and, citing the federal judiciary's rejection of Right, be acquitted of their crimes.

According to reports, the impact of the verdict has already been felt, with a Massachusetts man murdering three people this morning in front of several Boston police officers who by law could do nothing but watch. In addition, a woman who volunteered at a Toledo, OH soup kitchen has been arrested, sentenced to six months in jail, and fined $25,000.

""This ruling is so broad that even those who show an intent to do right can be prosecuted,"" said Martha Minow, dean of Harvard Law School. ""Make no mistake, the court is sending a message to pro-right supporters that fairness and equality are no longer the laws of the land. And the decision has no chance of being overturned in the immediate future, because the bench will be dominated by pro-wrong advocates for years to come.""

Justice Stephen Breyer chose to read his dissenting opinion aloud before the court, a rare gesture apparently aimed at expressing the full measure of his disgust with the verdict.

""The court needs to overturn this ruling immediately because, simply put, it's the right thing to do,"" said the associate justice, who, along with his colleagues joining him in the minority, was then arrested by Capitol Police, placed into custody, and is currently awaiting trial.",793,4890,6,40

His lawyers and relatives have been fighting ever since to have him repatriated to France. They have now decided now to publicise his case to put pressure on the French government.

Advertising Read more

""I pray and cry every day for a miracle. I can't imagine staying here for the full 16 years and eight months,” Azoulay wrote in letters sent to his family from Giresun prison in northeast Turkey, and seen by FRANCE 24.

Already incarcerated for almost four years for ""importing a banned narcotic product"", Azoulay, 43, has asked the French state to repatriate him so he can serve out the rest of his sentence in his own country.

Azoulay, who is gay and Jewish, says he is being harassed, mistreated and threatened on a daily basis.

Carole-Olivia Montenot, one of Azoulay's lawyers, describes feeling a sense of impotence as she hears of the horrors experienced by her client. ""It is terrible. He is being intimidated, his fellow inmates are telling him to convert to Islam and to pray five times a day. He is also being harassed because of his sexual orientation,"" she told FRANCE 24.

""His conditions of detention are an attack on human dignity,"" said Sophie Wiesenfeld, founder of the think-tank Hexagon Society and president of the Fabien Azoulay Support Committee.

""There are so many of us here living in such a small space. To go to the toilet at night, we have to walk on top of people who are sleeping. When they are woken up, they get angry and there are fights,"" Azoulay wrote in a letter sent to a relative.

Drug recently banned in Turkey

When he flew to Turkey nearly four years ago, Azoulay never imagined that he would end up in a Turkish prison. During a trip to Istanbul to get hair implants, he bought GBL (Gamma-Butyrolactone), a synthetic drug popular in party circles. He paid $300 via a Lithuanian website and arranged to have it delivered to his hotel.

""The product had been banned in Turkey just a few months earlier. But the website had not updated the list of countries that had banned it. Azoulay was therefore unaware that this product had been classified as an illegal narcotic in Turkey,"" Montenot explained.

Turkish customs intercepted the package and tracked its path to Azoulay's hotel room, where they arrested him.

According to Montenot, the arrest was followed by ""a succession of small hearings that each lasted about five minutes"". Azoulay’s fate was decided on February 27, 2018, at the end of an ""accelerated trial that lasted for about 15 minutes, including all the translations"", she said. The court sentenced the French national to 20 years in prison, later reduced to 16 years and eight months for good behaviour at an appeal hearing.

Despite his appeal and a legal petition, Turkish courts confirmed the initial verdict. Azoulay's sentence was finalised in January 2019. Five months later, his lawyers launched a repatriation request that would allow him to serve his sentence on French soil.

Azoulay was first incarcerated in a prison in Maltepe, a district of Istanbul. He believed it was necessary to hide his religious affiliation and explained in a letter sent to a friend that ""jihadists are trying to radicalise other prisoners"". In this overcrowded prison, he said he was subjected to forced prayers, physical violence and even witnessed a murder.

""One guy had his throat slit by a group of four Syrians. I was sleeping when it happened but the screams of the other prisoners woke me up. The sight of blood everywhere was frightening, worse than a horror movie. I later learned that the prisoner who died had made sexual advances on one of the Syrians and that, in the name of Allah, he had to pay with his life because of his homosexuality,"" he said in the letter.

'Collateral damage'

Although he tried to hide his sexual orientation from other inmates, Azoulay was the victim of a homophobic attack in November 2019. ""A fellow prisoner knew he was gay. In the middle of the night, he threw boiling water all over Fabien’s body, causing second-degree burns. Fabien had to be transferred to hospital,"" said Montenot.

Azoulay's lawyers reported this to France’s foreign ministry, which called an emergency meeting. The ministry proposed getting Azoulay transferred to another prison in Turkey. His legal team refused and reiterated their demands for his repatriation.

Azoulay was nevertheless sent to the prison where he is currently being held, 800 km from Istanbul. ""He is even more isolated there than he was in Istanbul,” says Wiesenfeld. “His family can no longer visit him because the area is surrounded by jihadists and it’s dangerous.”

Letters and a brief weekly telephone conversation with his brother are the only means of communication he has with his family.

The repatriation process remains at an impasse. ""The request for Fabien Azoulay's transfer, which was made officially in November 2019, has not seen any progress for almost two years,"" his lawyers said in a statement dated April 8. ""We are aware that dealings between France and Turkey are strained, but it is not acceptable that Fabien Azoulay should bear the brunt of this.”

""Fabien is collateral damage of the misunderstandings between France and Turkey,” says Wiesenfeld.

Relations reached new lows in October 2020, when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan controversially said that France’s President Emmanuel Macron needed to “have a mental check”. France had also drawn the wrath of Turkey for its military involvement in the eastern Mediterranean, an area that is the subject of Greek-Turkish tensions.

A détente seemed possible after a telephone conversation at the beginning of March between Macron and Erdogan. However, a new row erupted in France at the end of March over plans to build a mosque in Strasbourg.

In this tense diplomatic context, his lawyers and the Hexagon Society are struggling in their fight for Azoulay. ""We sent letters to the foreign affairs ministry, to the Turkish ambassador to France and to the French ambassador to Turkey. Their replies made us believe that the ministry would like to act but that it cannot, that it has to wait for the green light from the Élysée presidential palace.""

Contacted by FRANCE 24 on Monday, a diplomatic source indicated that ""the foreign ministry in Paris and our embassy in Turkey are fully mobilised regarding Mr. Azoulay’s situation"".

""Our consular services are in regular contact with Mr. Azoulay as well as with the Turkish authorities to inquire about his situation and the progress of his request for a transfer to France. In Paris, the services of this ministry are in regular contact with the family and lawyers of our compatriot.""

For their part, Azoulay’s lawyers sent a letter to Macron that has so far gone unanswered, Montenot says.

‘He wants to commit suicide’

On Saturday, a support group for Azoulay launched a petition to alert the public. By Tuesday morning it had already collected more than 77,000 signatures, including those of high-profile French personalities such as writer and economist Jacques Attali, Paris Deputy Mayor Audrey Pulvar and writer Pascal Bruckner.

But Azoulay's ordeal continues. ""His brother is trying to help Fabien as best he can. If he told him the true extent of the French government’s inertia, I don’t think Fabien would survive,"" says Montenot.

""Fabien has told his family that he will not make it through this, his fourth year in prison. He has fallen into a major depression. He is on medication and wants to commit suicide. He fears for his life.""

You can only do many episodes about how Ilhan Omar is leading a cabal of minorities to install Black supremacy in the country before it begins to feel a bit stale, you know? But then that Hispanic cashier tried to stiff me and didn’t apologize well enough for my liking, and then I heard him speaking Spanish to a coworker as I was leaving—it was like a light bulb went off. The creative juices started flowing, and before I knew it, I had a solid several hours of attacking immigrants for invading our country and uprooting traditional American values.

“After 250+ hours of research, we’ve reviewed all countries’ individual laws and gathered data from a variety of trusted international sources to create the definitive ‘LGBTQ+ Travel Safety Index’ that will help you find the safest (and least safe) countries for your next trip abroad,” wrote the journalists Lyric and Asher Fergusson, who oversee the travel safety blog.



The world’s most dangerous country for the LGBTQ community is Nigeria while the safest country is Canada, according to the study. The world’s most dangerous country for the LGBTQ community is Nigeria while the safest country is Canada, according to the study.

Within the top 20 most dangerous nations across the globe, Saudi Arabia ranked second among Middle East and North African nations, followed by Oman (5), Qatar (8), UAE (9), Yemen (10), Sudan (13), West Bank and Gaza (14), Iran (15), Morocco (18), Egypt (19), and Algeria (20).

“As of now, 28 countries have marriage equality, and 16 countries provide civil unions or partnerships,"" Asher and Lyric wrote. ""Two countries – Bulgaria and Israel – do not allow marriage equality for their citizens but formally recognize marriages overseas.”

Israel does not criminalize same-sex relations in contrast to nearly all countries in the Middle East and North Africa regions.

Qatar’s Islamic regime, which imposes the death penalty on gays, is slated to host the FIFA World Cup football competition in 2022. Saudi Arabia and the Islamic Republic of Iran also execute gays and lesbians.

According to a 2008 British WikiLeaks cable, Iran executed between 4,000-6,000 gays and lesbians since its 1979 Islamic revolution. The Jerusalem Post reported in 2019 that Iran’s regime publicly hanged a man based on a violation of its anti-gay law.

The Post’s disclosure of the 2019 execution in Iran played a role in the US government’s launching of a campaign to decriminalize homosexuality across the world. Richard Grenell, the former US director for national intelligence and ambassador to Germany at the time, jumpstarted the international campaign to stop state-sponsored executions of gays.

Lyric and Asher explained the study’s methodology: “We looked at the top 150 most-visited countries in the world (by the number of incoming tourists) and then carefully examined LGBTQ+ rights for each country. We created our LGBTQ+ travel safety index based on a total of nine ranking factors. In this year’s update, we also added transgender legal identity laws which weren’t included in our original 2019 study.”

The nine factors are: Legalizes same-sex marriage, worker protections, protection against discrimination, criminalization of violence, adoption recognition, whether it is a good place to live, transgender legal identity laws, illegal same-sex relations and propaganda/morality laws.",466,3010,21,140

Andrew Harnik/Pool via REUTERS

Former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo violated federal ethics rules governing the use of taxpayer-funded resources when he, and his wife, asked State Department employees to carry out personal tasks more than 100 times, a government watchdog said in a report on Friday.

Pompeo, who was former President Donald Trump's last secretary of state, served until Jan. 20, when Republican Trump left the office after being defeated by Democrat Joe Biden in the November election.

Pompeo is seen as among a handful of Republicans with presidential ambitions for 2024, even though the former top diplomat has not confirmed that.

Pompeo and his wife asked a political appointee and other employees in his office to carry out tasks such as ""picking up personal items, planning events unrelated to the Department's mission, and conducting such personal business as pet care and mailing personal Christmas cards,"" the State Department's Office of Inspector General (OIG) said in the report.

""The Pompeos made over 100 requests to employees in the office of the secretary to conduct work that appeared to be personal in nature,"" the report, which can be found here, said.

Among the incidents detailed in the report were a request from Susan Pompeo for an aide to make two hair salon appointments for her. On another occasion, an under secretary of state appeared to help the Pompeos' son secure a discount for a hotel room, the report said.

Pompeo slammed the report, saying it was politically motivated and filled with factual errors.

""At no time did I, or my wife Susan, misuse taxpayer money or violate rules or ethical norms,"" Pompeo said in a statement. ""Our actions were constantly reviewed by dozens of lawyers, and we made massive efforts, and did, comply with every requirement,"" he said.

Pompeo during his tenure had a contentious relationship with the Department's watchdog. A former inspector general, Steve Linick, was fired by Trump at Pompeo's recommendation.

Linick was probing whether Pompeo misused a taxpayer-funded political appointee to perform personal tasks for himself and his wife.

OIG said it had completed most of its fieldwork on the report by August 2020. Its completion of the report was delayed because Pompeo refused to grant an interview to the OIG for several months until sitting down with them in December.

A State Department spokesman said the agency concurred with ""all the recommendations (in the report) and will proceed to implement them.""

Prof. Nancy Agmon-Levin, who conducted the study, told The Jerusalem Post that she believes “ masks blocked infectious agents and definitely pollen.”

Agmon-Levin is the head of Sheba’s Clinical Immunology, Angioedema and Allergy Unit. She said that she and her team were hearing comments from patients that they had a lot less allergies this year compared to previous years.

“We thought this is probably because of wearing masks, but thought about how we could prove the idea,” she explained. “We checked the referrals to the emergency department due to asthma, of which 80% to 90% of all asthma patients are due to allergies.”

While there were such large decreases in asthma referrals, there was only around a 10% decrease in overall emergency department referrals during the same period.

Likewise, when looking at the first quarter of the year, pollution levels appear very similar to every other year, she said.

Allergies affect 30% of the Israeli population, according to the Health Ministry.

“You go outside during Passover – a time in which many plants are blooming that are highly allergic in Israel – wearing a mask and most pollens will not penetrate your nose and mouth, so you will have a lot less allergies,” Agmon-Levin said. “It’s a nice idea that you can decrease exacerbation from pollen with something that costs 90 agorot compared to the drugs we usually give patients that are very expensive and have many more adverse effects.”

This is the second Israeli study published on the subject. A separate report was released late last year by the Galilee Medical Center and Bar-Ilan University that was published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and showed that 40% of 215 nurses who wore either surgical masks or N95 masks experienced less sneezing and suffered less from having runny or stuffy noses.

India typically produces more than 60% of all vaccines sold globally, and is home to the Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's largest vaccine maker. Its vast manufacturing capability is why the country signed on as a major player in COVAX, the global vaccine-sharing initiative that provides discounted or free doses for lower-income countries. Under the initial agreement announced last year , SII would manufacture up to 200 million doses for up to 92 countries.

But the situation in India is markedly different from just a few months ago. Its second wave began in March, quickly surpassing the first, which had peaked last September at more than 97,000 coronavirus cases a day.

On Sunday, the country reported 261,500 new cases -- its highest single-day figure so far, according to data from the Indian Ministry of Health. India added a million new cases in less than a week, surpassing 14 million total cases on Thursday.

States and cities are imposing new restrictions, including weekend and nighttime curfews in the capital region Delhi, home to 19 million people. Migrant workers are also leaving major cities en masse for their home villages, afraid any potential lockdowns will leave them stranded.

And through it all, vaccine supplies have dried up on the ground, with at least five states reporting severe shortages and urging the federal government to act.

In the face of crisis, the government and SII have shifted focus from supplying vaccines to COVAX to prioritizing their own citizens at home.

""Deliveries of doses from the Serum Institute of India will be delayed in March and April,"" said COVAX, which is run by a coalition including international vaccine organization Gavi and the World Health Organization, in a news release on March 25 . ""Delays in securing supplies of SII-produced Covid-19 vaccine doses are due to the increased demand for Covid-19 vaccines in India.""

Boxes of the AstraZeneca vaccine, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and provided through the COVAX global initiative, arrive in Mogadishu, Somalia on March 15.

India had provided 28 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine so far, and was scheduled to deliver another 40 million doses in March and 50 million in April, the release said, adding that COVAX and the Indian government ""remain in discussions"" about completing supplies.

It's not the first time India had to pause its COVAX contributions: in January, the government restricted the export of AstraZeneca vaccines produced by SII ""because they want to prioritize for the most vulnerable and needy segments first,"" SII CEO Adar Poonawalla.

But these repeated delays have hit poor countries hard. The director of Africa's disease control body warned India's hold on exports could be ""catastrophic"" for the continent -- while Pakistan, one of the biggest program recipients, decided to allow private vaccine imports and sales to fill the gap.

Vaccination centers turning people away

India is administering two vaccines domestically: the Oxford-AstraZeneca one, also known as Covishield, and its homegrown Covaxin , developed jointly by Bharat Biotech and the government-run Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)

The country started its vaccination program in January for health care workers and priority groups, with the goal of fully inoculating 300 million people by August. But the program had a sluggish start, facing logistical issues as well as vaccine hesitancy among the population -- especially towards Covaxin, which was approved for emergency use before the efficacy data of its third phase trial were released.

To date, only 14.3 million people have been fully vaccinated -- just over 1% of India's population of 1.3 billion, according to Johns Hopkins University

But public confidence rose as the government stepped up an awareness campaign to assuage concerns, and the vaccination program picked up speed. As new daily cases accelerated in March and April, several states began reporting major vaccine shortages.

A vaccination center in Mumbai, India, that had to turn people away due to a shortage of vaccines on April 9.

In Odisha, nearly 700 vaccination centers had to close last week due to shortages, wrote health authorities in a letter to the central government, warning the state would soon exhaust its available stock.

Rajesh Bhaskar, a health official in Punjab, told CNN last week the state had about 450,000 doses of Covishield and 30,000 doses of Covaxin. The state is home to more than 27 million people, according to the government's latest available statistics . ""We want to vaccinate about 100,000 people per day at least, and the current supply is insufficient to meet that demand,"" he said.

Several districts in Maharashtra, the worst-hit state, had to temporarily suspend vaccination drives, including more than 70 centers in Mumbai that shut last week, according to the state's health minister, Rajesh Tope. Maharashtra had administered more than 11.1 million doses as of Thursday, the most of any Indian states, according to the Indian Ministry of Health.

""In both cities and villages, we have created teams ... to bring all those above 45 years old to take the vaccine,"" Tope said on April 7. ""People are coming to the centers, but our healthcare workers have to tell them that they haven't received the vaccine so they should go home.""

There are several challenges contributing to the shortages -- one being the supply of raw materials, said former ICMR director general Nirmal Kumar Ganguly.

India ""has the capacity to produce,"" Ganguly added, but supply chains have been disrupted during the pandemic. The vaccine formulas and required materials ""cannot be changed overnight, so we have to rely on the raw materials being imported.""

The US has placed a temporary ban on exporting raw materials critical for vaccine production -- and the EU has similarly tightened restrictions around vaccine exports. India is now working to ""adapt to the materials which are made at home or the neighboring countries like Singapore,"" but this will take time, said Ganguly.

An additional challenge is the country's reliance on SII, he added. There are other vaccine manufacturers in the country, such as Bharat Biotech, but SII remains the largest.

""The need has been glaringly brought out that we need to expand our capacity,"" Ganguly said. ""We are one of the vaccine exporters but these are done by two or three Indian companies at the moment, the rest of them are not big players and some of them are totally new in vaccine production.""

Government's mixed response

Several states have requested more doses from the central government -- but federal officials have pushed back, insisting the situation is under control.

Tope's complaints were ""nothing but an attempt to divert attention from Maharashtra government's repeated failures to control the spread of pandemic,"" said Indian Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in a statement last week. Home Minister Amit Shah also refuted states' claims, saying their information was ""not true"" and vaccines were available, ""as much as is required.""

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made a point of praising India's vaccination effort as a success. During a meeting with state governors on Wednesday, Modi ""highlighted that India has become the fastest nation to reach the landmark of 10 crore vaccinations (100 million doses),"" according to a statement from his office.

India took 85 days to reach 100 million doses. By comparison, the US took 89 days and China 102 days, according to Modi's office.

And on Tuesday, Rajesh Bhushan, the health ministry's secretary, said the problem was poor planning and management -- not supply. ""We are making doses available to states in a timely manner,"" he said, adding that states should ""look at how many unutilized doses there are at each cold chain point.""

Boxes of AstraZeneca vaccine, produced by the Serum Institute of India and donated by the Indian government, arrive in Kabul, Afghanistan, on February 7, 2021.

In a sign the federal government may be feeling the pressure, it took action this week to open the doors for vaccine imports. On Tuesday, it announced it would fast-track emergency approvals for vaccines already approved by the World Health Organization or authorities in the United States, Europe, Britain and Japan.

Companies still need to apply for approval in India, but they will be exempt from having to conduct local safety trials, expediting the process.

""If any of these regulators have approved a vaccine, the vaccine is now ready to be brought into the country for use, manufacture and fill-and-finish,"" Dr. VK Paul, a senior health official at the government-run think tank Niti Aayog, said at a news conference on Tuesday. ""We hope and we invite the vaccine makers such as Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and others ... to be ready to come to India as early as possible.""

The move is ""a calculated step"" by the government to ""ensure we have more vaccines available,"" said Ganguly. The government could also expand its supply through the private market -- but this brings additional challenges too, he said, including the question of how to price vaccines to provide equitable access to the poor.

But even the possibility of importing foreign vaccines won't be a quick fix, since companies like Pfizer and Moderna have other orders to fulfill first, including supplying vaccines for the US. India just granted emergency use authorization for Russia's Sputnik vaccine -- but ""by the time they build up manufacturing capacities and manufacturing requirements, it will be five to six months,"" Ganguly said.

In the meantime, the government is working to expand local production capacity -- a state-run biomedical institute in Maharashtra was given the green light to manufacture the Covaxin vaccine on Thursday, through a transfer of technology with Bharat Biotech.

""If possible, (the women should) postpone the pregnancy a bit to a better time so that (they) can have a more peaceful pregnancy,"" Secretary of Primary Health Care of the Brazilian health ministry Raphael Camara said Friday. ""We cannot say this to those who are 42, 43 years old, of course, but for a young woman who can, the best thing is to wait for a little,"" he said during a press conference.

Cities across the country have been hit hard by a recent surge in Covid-19 cases and deaths, fueled in part by new variants believed to be extra contagious and some Brazilians' disregard for social distancing precautions.

The country could be headed for even worse times thanks to a combination of political chaos and inaction, a team of public health experts warned this week.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Former Officer Derek Chauvin chose not to take the stand as testimony at his murder trial ended Thursday, passing up the chance to explain to the jury and the public for the first time what he was thinking when he pressed his knee against George Floyd’s neck.

Closing arguments are set to begin Monday, after which a racially diverse jury will begin deliberating at a barbed-wire-ringed courthouse in a city on edge — not just because of the Chauvin case but because of the deadly police shooting of a 20-year-old Black man in a Minneapolis suburb last weekend.

ADVERTISEMENT

Before the jury was brought in Thursday morning, Chauvin, his COVID-19 mask removed in a rare courtroom moment, ended weeks of speculation by informing the judge he would invoke his Fifth Amendment right not to testify.

Shortly afterward, the defense rested its case, after a total of two days of testimony, compared with two weeks for the prosecution.

Judge Peter Cahill reminded the jurors they will be sequestered starting Monday and said: “If I were you, I would plan for long and hope for short.”

Chauvin, 45, is charged with murder and manslaughter in Floyd’s death after the 46-year-old Black man was arrested on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 at a neighborhood market last May.

Bystander video of Floyd gasping that he couldn’t breathe as bystanders yelled at Chauvin to get off him triggered worldwide protests, violence and a furious examination of racism and policing in the U.S.

The most serious charge against the now-fired white officer, second-degree murder, carries up to 40 years in prison, though state guidelines call for about 12.

Prosecutors say Floyd died because the officer’s knee was pressed against Floyd’s neck or close to it for 9 1/2 minutes as he lay on the pavement on his stomach, his hands cuffed behind him and his face jammed against the ground.

Law enforcement veterans inside and outside the Minneapolis department testified for the prosecution that Chauvin used excessive force and went against his training, while medical experts said Floyd died of asphyxia, or lack of oxygen, because his breathing was constricted by the way he was held down.

Chauvin attorney Eric Nelson called a police use-of-force expert and a forensic pathologist to help make the case that Chauvin acted reasonably against a struggling suspect and that Floyd died because of an underlying heart condition and his illegal drug use. Floyd had high blood pressure and narrowed arteries, and fentanyl and methamphetamine were found in his system.

ADVERTISEMENT

The only time Chauvin has been heard defending himself was when the jury listened to body-camera footage from the scene. After an ambulance had taken Floyd away, Chauvin told a bystander: “We gotta control this guy ’cause he’s a sizable guy ... and it looks like he’s probably on something.”

The decision of whether Chauvin should testify carried risks either way.

Taking the stand could have opened him up to devastating cross-examination, with prosecutors replaying the video of the arrest and forcing Chauvin to explain, one frame at a time, why he kept pressing down on Floyd.

But testifying could have also given the jury the opportunity to look at his unmasked face and see or hear any remorse or sympathy he might feel.

Also, what was going through Chauvin’s mind could be crucial: Legal experts say that an officer who believes his or her life was at risk can be found to have acted legally even if, in hindsight, it turns out there was no such danger.

In one final bit of testimony on Thursday, the prosecution briefly recalled a lung and critical care expert to knock down a defense witness’ theory that carbon monoxide poisoning from a squad car’s exhaust might have contributed to Floyd’s death. Dr. Martin Tobin noted hospital tests that showed Floyd’s level was at most 2%, within the normal range.

With the trial in session, Minneapolis has been bracing for a possible repeat of the protests and violence that broke out last spring over Floyd’s death.

The case has unfolded amid days of protests in the adjoining suburb of Brooklyn Center, after Officer Kim Potter, who is white, apparently mistook her gun for a Taser and fatally shot Daunte Wright. She resigned and was charged with manslaughter.

Soaring ahead of its competition, the PS5 is a game-changing next- generation console that Santa just can’t afford right now, okay, S port?

Sadly, things are a little tight money-wise in Santa’s Workshop at the moment, C hamp, if that makes sense.



Building on the success of the PS4, the gigantic new console pushes gaming to a whole new level, utilizing an AMD-powered GPU that can process 10.28 teraflops for the most immersive user experience to date. Santa would simply love to get one for you, Slugger, if the economy wasn’t so bad right now that it’s even affecting the North Pole.

Perhaps most impressive of all the PS5 ’ s features is its DualSense controller, whose minimalist aesthetic belies a sophisticated interface with greatly improved haptic feedback that allows you to feel as though you’re really there with every raindrop, or at least, you would feel that way if the bank could have just cut Santa some slack with interest payments on his magical sled.

Preloaded with the enjoyable, if not revolutionary, platformer Astro’s Playroom, which serves mostly as a demo reel of the console’s newest technologies, there are actually two editions of the system available: one including a 4K Blu-ray drive with a price tag of $499, and the slimmer Digital Edition, which at $100 less is still too big an expense for Santa what with all the payments for someone to babysit all of his reindeer and little elves.

Of course, the PS5 is not completely perfect. There are some noticeable flubs here and there, including an overreliance on outmoded options menus and a counterintuitive home button configuration, so no need to cry, Buddy, huh? It’s not because of anything you did. You’ve been so good this year! Santa still loves you very, very much, and I promise there’s so much other fun other stuff you’re going to get this year that you won’t even miss the PlayStation, honest!



Remember how much you like Air Bud? Well, let’s just say ol’ Saint Nick got his hands on the DVDs for a few sequels this holiday season.

Thanks to its impressive engineering, backwards compatibility, and exciting pipeline of new titles showing off exactly what the next-gen is all about, we’re sure the PS5 is going to be around for quite a while. So dry your eyes, Chief, and think about how much more you’ll appreciate the system when you get it for your birthday next year or maybe next Christmas depending on how a couple of Santa’s job interviews pan out.

In addition to the 73 percent of poll respondents who described this shit as ""beyond belief,"" 9 percent said they could ""hardly"" believe this shit, with another 5 percent ""just barely"" believing it. An additional 13 percent said they ""couldn't give a flying fuck about the whole goddamn thing.""

The poll also found that the National Shit-Credulity Index (NSCI) has hit an all-time low, with only 2 percent of Americans describing themselves as ""fully confident of [their] capacity to believe this shit.""

""The American people have had to deal with this kind of shit for years,"" Gallup Organization president Lee Sanderson said, ""but now, for the first time, it appears that the vast majority of them just can't fucking believe it anymore.""

""In all honesty, who can blame them?"" Sanderson added. ""Regardless of one's political affiliation, socioeconomic status, religion or just about any other viewpoint, you've got to admit, the shit that's been going on lately is way out of hand.""

In the wake of the poll, many activists are calling upon America's leaders to get their shit in gear.

""The American people have had it up to here with this shitheap,"" said James Schuerholz, president of the D.C.-based Heritage Foundation. ""There is a public mandate for our leaders to cut this shit out, and it's high time they finally did.""

Despite Americans' incredulity over this shit, historians note that this sort of shit has been going on for years and is unlikely to end anytime soon.

""Contrary to popular belief, this type of shit is hardly anything new,"" Harvard University American history professor Lawrence Coombs said. ""The same shit was going down 50, 100 and 150 years ago. The only difference was, back then, you never read about that shit in the newspapers.""

Calling the American people's enormous shit-belief capacity ""one of the cornerstones of our democracy,"" U.S. Sen. John Kerry (D-MA) stressed that it is the patriotic duty of all citizens to grant our leaders the benefit of the doubt with regard to their shit.

""If the American people are no longer willing to believe this shit, who will?"" Kerry said. ""Somebody's got to take this shit at face value. Otherwise, why are we even doing all this shit in the first place? I am truly saddened by the lack of faith that the citizens of this country are willing to put in my shit, as well as that of my esteemed colleagues. We must repair our society's fraying trust in the shit of our elected officials, or you would not believe the kind of hardcore, heavy-duty shit that will come down.""

""America,"" conservative author and social critic Patricia Stouffer said, ""is seriously losing its shit. But we've got to somehow hold our shit in place until all this passes. We've got to learn to believe in shit again. After this latest shitstorm, it may take years to accomplish, but we must somehow find the strength to put our trust back into the nation's shit.""

Despite such impassioned calls for faith in the U.S. political system and all the shit that comes with it, if the Gallup Poll is any indication, the majority of Americans are no longer willing to put up with the shit.

""Fuck that shit,"" said Evansville, IN, day-care provider Helen Reiderer. ""I'm tired of hearing about it. Do they actually expect us to still believe that load of shit?""

New Delhi, April 17

The police in Australia have arrested an Indian with an expired visa for one among a series of violent incidents within the Indian community over the farm laws.

The man has been remanded to custody after being denied bail in the recent alleged ‘hate crime’ incident in Harris Park, Sydney. A local TV channel, Seven News, reported that the arrested accused person’s visa has expired and could be deported.

“Sikhs identified by their turban were targeted because of tensions in India,” said the report, adding that further arrests are imminent.

Since September last year, local police officers have been investigating a number of incidents in Harris Park of Sydney, reported the Melbourne-based South Asia Times.

The Indian has been charged with three counts of affray, three counts of armed with intent to commit indictable offence, two counts of destroying or damaging and assault.

Detailing the three incidents, the New South Wales (NSW) police said in the first incident on September 16, a man was struck several times in the head with a baseball bat and then kicked when on the ground by a group of five men.

On February 14, a man driving a car was allegedly attacked by a group of up to five men, holding sticks and other weapons.

On February 28, a group of people travelling in a vehicle was allegedly attacked by up to 10 men, seriously damaging the vehicle.

“We are very happy with the NSW Police and hope all the culprits in the incidents are caught. These people have no place in the wider Indian community,” said Amar Singh, Turbans 4 Australia.

He said the Indian government’s representatives in Australia must step-up and take responsibility for the behaviour, most of whom he claimed have been identified by the police.

Australian-Indians have called on the Indian High Commission to step-up interaction with and monitor the behaviour of international students.

They have asked for a pre-flight strategic awareness plan for students coming to study in Australia outlining the country’s laws and values, so that the new arrivals know how they need to behave and what it takes to integrate into the Australian community.",364,2186,9,50

REUTERS/Mohamed Nureldin Abdallah/File Photo

Sexual violence is being used as a weapon of war in Ethiopia's Tigray, the U.N. aid chief told the Security Council on Thursday, prompting the U.S. envoy to challenge the body's silence, asking: ""Do African lives not matter as much as those experiencing conflict in other countries?""

The U.N. official, Mark Lowcock, said the humanitarian crisis in Tigray had deteriorated over the past month with challenges to aid access and people dying of hunger. He said the world body had not seen any proof that soldiers from neighboring Eritrea - accused of massacres and killings in Tigray - have withdrawn.

""To be very clear: the conflict is not over and things are not improving,"" Lowcock said, according to his notes for the private briefing, which was requested by the United States.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield noted Thursday's briefing was the fifth private council meeting since fighting between Ethiopia's federal government troops and Tigray's former ruling party began in November, according to diplomats familiar with her remarks.

""The Security Council has been unified on Syria, Yemen and even on Burma, where we were able to come together to release a statement,"" she said, according to the diplomats. ""We are asking the council to reconsider a statement on Ethiopia. ... Victims need to know the Security Council cares about this conflict.""

The council has so far been unable to agree on a public statement on Tigray, with Western countries pitted against Russia and China, which diplomats say question whether the body - charged with maintaining international peace and security - should be involved in the crisis.

The conflict has killed thousands of people and forced hundreds of thousands more from their homes in the mountainous region of about 5 million. Eritrea has been helping Ethiopian troops, although Eritrea has repeatedly denied its forces are in Tigray.

Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has acknowledged the Eritrean presence and the United Nations and the United States have demanded that Eritrean troops withdraw from Tigray.

""Neither the U.N. nor any of the humanitarian agencies we work with have seen proof of Eritrean withdrawal,"" Lowcock said.

GIRLS AS YOUNG AS 8 TARGETED

Lowcock said he had received a report earlier on Thursday that 150 people had died from hunger in Tigray and warned that ""starvation as a weapon of war is a violation.""

Dr. Fasika Amdeselassie, the top public health official for the government-appointed interim administration in Tigray, told Reuters that at least 829 cases of sexual assault had been reported at five hospitals since the conflict began. read more

""There is no doubt that sexual violence is being used in this conflict as a weapon of war,"" Lowcock said, adding the majority of rapes were committed by men in uniform, with accusations made against all the warring parties.

""Nearly a quarter of reports received by one agency involve gang rape, with multiple men assaulting the victim; in some cases, women have been repeatedly raped over a period of days. Girls as young as eight are being targeted,"" Lowcock said.

Ethiopia's U.N. ambassador, Taye Atskeselassie Amde, told Reuters the government was investigating all rights violations. He accused Lowcock of ""behaving not like a humanitarian but a nemesis determined to exact some kind of retribution.""

""Human rights violations are too serious and grave to be subjected to speculations. It is unfortunate the head of OCHA (the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) resorted to such an act before the U.N. Security Council,"" he said, adding that ""there is no gap in humanitarian access.""

Eritrea's U.N. mission in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Lowcock's remarks. Last month, Eritrean Information Minister Yemane Gebremeskel said that sexual violence and rape ""are an abomination to Eritrean society"" and should be harshly punished if they occurred.

'Security law could be used to target the press'

Chairman of the Journalists Association, Chris Yeung

The chairman of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, Chris Yeung, on Saturday said he’s extremely concerned that freedom of the press here could be further restrained, after Police Commissioner Chris Tang warned that the national security law could be used to tackle “fake news”.



The police chief has, for the second day in a row, accused a newspaper he didn't name of linking children who attended the police college open day on Thursday to ""black violence"".



Tang’s repeated criticism came after Apple Daily ran a side-story on its front page on Friday, saying children who attended the open day were given toy guns to play with, inside a mock-up of an MTR carriage.



A photo showing such a scene went viral on social media, and the newspaper noted that many people said it reminded them of the shocking violence meted out by police officers on people at Prince Edward MTR Station on August 31, 2019.



Addressing the media on Saturday, Tang again accused the newspaper of inciting hatred and dividing society, adding that while there are currently no laws to tackle the dissemination of “fake news”, the force can address the issue by considering whether those involved have breached the national security law or committed acts of incitement.



In response, the chairman of the Journalists Association said he’s very worried that the national security law would be “weaponised” to target the press.



Yeung said the police chief was wrong to accuse Apple Daily of spreading fake news, as the pro-democracy newspaper had published a genuine photo.



“This is not a fake photo. It’s a real photo. Being debated was about how the photo was being handled by the newspaper. But that’s a matter of judgement and different editorial treatment common in different media,” he said.



“If he [Chris Tang] thinks its fake [news], spell it out. Which part is fake?” he questioned.



Yeung added that it’s likely that the force may soon start to target media outlets or journalists for publishing news that it doesn’t like.



“Based on the commissioner’s logic, it might happen because he argued a photo could be divisive and could fuel hatred towards the police and that could fall into the national security law. That’s a very worrying example because the way different media handle pictures or their coverage is entirely based on their professional judgement,” he said.



“The case he was referring to, the way Apple Daily handled the picture, in fact could have happened to many media outlets… if his logic applies, it will affect almost everyone in the media.”



Yeung said the association has been demanding a proper dialogue with the government on various issues affecting press freedom, adding that discussions should be based on “facts and reason”.",480,2919,14,77

COVAX conundrum

NEW DELHI: After gifting and selling tens of millions of Covid-19 vaccine doses abroad, India suddenly finds itself short of shots as new infections surge in the world's second-most populous country.India breached 200,000 daily infections for the first time on Thursday, and is trying to inoculate more of its population using domestically produced shots.Facing soaring cases and overflowing hospitals after lockdown restrictions were eased, it also abruptly changed the rules to allow it to fast-track vaccine imports, having earlier rebuffed foreign drugmakers like Pfizer.It will import Russia's Sputnik V vaccine starting this month to cover as many as 125 million people.The reversal in fortunes could hamper not only India's battle to contain the pandemic, but also vaccination campaigns in more than 60 poorer countries, mainly in Africa, for months.The COVAX programme, backed by the World Health Organization and Gavi vaccine alliance, aims at equitable vaccine access around the world, and is relying heavily on supplies from India, Asia's pharmaceutical powerhouse.But so far this month India has only exported around 1.2 million vaccine doses. That compares with 64 million doses shipped abroad between late January and March, according to data from the foreign ministry.An official with knowledge of India's vaccine strategy said that available shots would be used domestically while the country faced an ""emergency situation"".""There is no commitment to other countries,"" he said.India's foreign ministry, which oversees vaccine deals with other countries, said last week that Indian demand would dictate the level of exports.Resulting shortages are already being felt in some countries in the COVAX scheme, and a UN health official involved in the vaccine rollout in Africa said: ""To be so reliant on one manufacturer is a massive concern.""The director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, said earlier this month delays in supplies from India could be ""catastrophic"".Four sources involved in discussions on vaccine supplies and procurement said factors including delays by India and COVAX in placing firm orders, a lack of investment in production, raw material shortages and underestimating the coronavirus surge at home had contributed to vaccine shortages.The Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's biggest vaccine manufacturer, had vowed to deliver at least 2 billion Covid-19 shots to low and middle-income countries, with nearly half of that by the end of 2021.But it has also come under pressure to meet the needs of other governments, including Britain, Canada and Saudi Arabia, amid AstraZeneca's global production problems.The United States, meanwhile, ring-fenced the supply of key equipment and raw materials for its own vaccine makers, limiting SII's operations and delaying by months its goal of raising monthly output to 100 million from up to 70 million now, said one of the sources.A further initial hurdle to SII's supply ambitions was India's hesitation in placing firm orders, two sources said.That could have allowed it to boost output of the AstraZeneca vaccine early, even though regulators had yet to approve it.India spent months discussing the final price per dose, and inked an initial purchase order roughly two weeks after India's drug regulator approved the AstraZeneca shot, according to the sources.At one point, SII ran out of space to store produced doses.""That is why I chose not to pack more than 50 million doses, because I knew if I packed more than that, I would have to store it in my house,"" SII Chief Executive Adar Poonawalla told Reuters in January.He said he had spent 20 billion rupees ($272 million) on the 50 million doses that the company started stockpiling since around October.Even now, the government only makes ad-hoc purchases from SII instead of agreeing a longer-term supply schedule, said one of the sources.SII has sought more than $400 million from the government to increase capacity, but no commitment has yet been made.The health department and foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment on issues of funding, purchasing delays and other aspects of India's vaccination rollout.COVAX also did not green-light shipments to participating countries from SII until after the shot received WHO clearance in mid-February, said a source involved in the COVAX initiative.The source said those delays meant tens of millions of additional doses that the SII could have produced between October and February never materialised.Gavi defended its decision to wait for proper approvals before going ahead with firm orders. And while it is looking for more suppliers, it conceded that much still depended on India's vaccine makers who account for some 60% of global supplies.COVAX has a deal to buy 1 billion-plus doses from the SII. But it has received less than a fifth of the 100 million or so doses of the SII-made AstraZeneca vaccine it had expected by May. SII is also supposed to make millions of doses of the Novavax shot for COVAX.Gavi had hoped SII would fully resume vaccine deliveries to COVAX in May, but on Wednesday it said India's Covid-19 crisis could affect that.""We understand the ferocity of the virus in India at the current time, nevertheless we hope and expect deliveries to resume as soon as possible,"" it said in an email to Reuters.On Thursday India reported 200,739 infections over the past 24 hours, a seventh daily record in the last eight days, while 1,038 deaths took its toll to 173,123. Its tally of 14.1 million infections is second only to the United States.Having originally aimed to cover 300 million of its highest-risk people by August, or just over a fifth of its 1.35 billion population, the government has now expanded that by another 100 million, with the promise to widen it further.",929,5873,22,126

It’s the most important election of our lifetimes.” Additional reports suggested that the prospects of a badly compromised political system in the United States were so disturbing to contemplate that Americans decided that real democracy had at some point actually existed.

The Russian government said it had arrested two men who were planning to attempt a coup in Belarus and intended to assassinate President Alexander Lukashenko,https://www.dw.com/en/belarus-two-men-accused-of-planning-coup-arrested-in-moscow/a-57241861,"Russian authorities on Saturday announced they had arrested two men in Moscow for allegedly planning a coup in Belarus. The two Belarusian men, Yuri Zyankovich and Alexander Feduta, were allegedly planning to carry out the coup attempt in Minsk on May 9, a day when Belarus celebrates victory over the Nazis.

Russia's principal security agency, the FSB, said the men sought to carry out an assassination of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. The Russian agency said the two men have been handed over to Belarus.

The FSB claimed the two men were in Moscow to meet with anti-Lukashenko Belarusian generals to discuss the plot.

Who were the suspects?

Lukashenko confirmed the arrests and said he believes the US government is behind the alleged operation. One of the suspects, Zyankovich, also holds American citizenship.

Feduta had gone missing in Moscow earlier this month. He had reportedly arrived in Russia in late March. He previously served as Lukashenko's first press secretary in 1994, before falling out with him the following year. He has since become one of the leading opposition figures to the Belarusian president.

Lukashenko, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has served as the country's president for the past 27 years. In September, Lukashenko was accused of rigging the presidential election against opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, a claim he denies.

Could the coup allegations be made up by Russia and Belarus?

Tsikhanouskaya's senior advisor, Franak Viacorka, said on Twitter he believes the arrests of the two men are a ""provocation"" organized by the secret services of Russia and Belarus.

""There is a high probability that Lukashenko's regime will use this provocation to intensify repressions, isolate the country and make deals that threaten the national interests of Belarus,"" Viacorka added.

Belarusians have taken to the streets in recent months to protest Lukashenko's government since the September election, with the government in turn cracking down on demonstrators, opposition figures and critical media.",320,2075,35,219

There are tens of thousands of pieces of evidence included in Ms Maxwell's trial, and the new release of 2,100 photos will only add to the mountain of evidence the alleged sex trafficker's lawyers will have to pour over before she goes to trial.

Ms Maxwell's lawyer sent a letter to Judge Alison Nathan requesting more time to review the materials.

The trial is set to begin on 12 July.

Ms Maxwell was hit with two additional charges of sex trafficking late last month after a new accuser levied claims against her. As a result, Ms Maxwell's lawyers have asked to ""re-review"" the existing evidence to consider the latest charges.

The latest accuser, a woman who is now in her 30's, alleged that Ms Maxwell recruited her to send sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein nude ""sexualised messages"" to his home in Palm Beach between 2001 and 2004. She also claimed that Ms Maxwell groomed her to engage in sex acts with Epstein.

According to the indictment discussing her accusations, “Maxwell asked Minor Victim-4 about her family and other aspects of her life. Maxwell also sought to normalize inappropriate and abusive conduct by, among other things, discussing sexual topics in front of Minor Victim-4 and being present when Minor Victim- 4 was nude in the massage room of the Palm Beach Residence.”

The accuser would have been between the ages of 14 and 17 at the time she was involved with Epstein.

“We cannot adequately prepare for a trial containing the new charges and a substantially expanded conspiracy in the less than three months remaining,” the lawyers said in their letter.

Ms Maxwell's lawyers also claimed that technology issues were hindering her ability to review the evidence herself.

“We have tried to use an FBI-supplied laptop and hard drive to review approximately 2,100 ‘Highly Confidential’ photographs that were not produced to us in discovery,” the lawyers wrote in the letter. “Because of technical issues with the laptop, we still have not completed the review.”

Thus far, a ruling to change the date of the trial has not been made.

It’s a position that is so ingrained in the American character that President Lincoln sat down right up until he died, a martyr for his cause of remaining seated. The Lincoln Memorial sits as a resolute tribute to our shared beliefs and history.” The report added that Americans continued to disapprove of statues of Confederate generals because although many of them were sitting, they were sitting on horses, and the nation overwhelmingly rejected any memorials that celebrated the lost cause of physical activity.

The 61-year-old patient at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro had a check-up last summer after being diagnosed with Hogkin's Lymphoma, a rare blood cancer that affects 2,100 people in the UK each year.

The disease, which occurs when white blood cells get out of control and spread to the lymph nodes, is typically treated with chemotherapy and around 90 per cent of patients are still alive five years afterwards.

Days after being told his chest was riddled with tumours and before starting treatment, the man was admitted to hospital after developing severe Covid. After making a full recovery, he had another scan and discovered the cancer had almost completely disappeared.

Sudden remission with Hogkin's Lymphoma is possible but is extremely rare. Just a couple of dozen similar cases have ever been recorded worldwide.

The case was revealed in the British Journal of Haematology.

Dr Sarah Challoner, of the Royal Cornwall Hospital, said: ""We think Covid-19 triggered an anti-tumour immune response.""

Dr Challoner added that the medical team believed T-cells, which fight infections in the body, may have also attacked cancer cells and led to the remission.

However, other clinicians warned against making early assumptions about the cause of the recovery. Martin Ledwick, Cancer Research UK's head cancer information nurse, said: ""At this stage it's too early to draw any conclusions from these cases – it's quite possibly a coincidence.

""Anyone undergoing cancer treatment should continue to follow the advice of their doctors, as well as protecting themselves from catching Covid-19, and we encourage all who can to take up the vaccine.""

Hejazi died due to a “heart condition,” the IRGC statement said, without elaborating further.

For all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app.

Hejazi was appointed as the deputy commander of the Quds Force – the overseas arm of the IRGC – in January 2020 following the US killing of Iran’s top commander Qassem Soleimani.

Born in the 1950s in the city of Isfahan, Hejazi joined the IRGC soon after it was established in 1979. Over the years, he occupied several key positions within the force, including commander of the IRGC’s Basij militia and deputy commander-in-chief of the IRGC.

Hejazi also commanded the IRGC’s Tharallah base in the capital Tehran in 2009, which oversaw the suppression of protests in the city that followed Iran’s controversial presidential elections that year.

The Council of the European Union added Hejazi to its sanctions list in October 2011 for playing a “central role in the post-election crackdown.”

Hejazi also commanded IRGC forces in Lebanon for some time, according to the IRGC statement.

In recent years, Hejazi assisted Iranian and Iranian-backed forces in Syria using his “valuable experience,” the statement said.",217,1365,13,86
0,France finally outlaws sex with children under 15 after Duhamel-Kouchner incest scandal reignites age-of-consent debate,https://www.rt.com/news/521197-france-bans-sex-children/,"French lawmakers have adopted a law cracking down on sex with children and incest, following a social media firestorm touched off by allegations of incestuous abuse against a prominent intellectual earlier this year.

The Assemblee Nationale voted unanimously on Thursday to set the age of consent at 15, classifying sex with children under that age – as well as incestuous sex with anyone under 18 – as rape, punishable by up to 20 years in prison.

“This is a historic law for our children and our society,” Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti told lawmakers, adding that it sends a clear message that “children are off-limits.”

The law also includes tougher penalties on internet pedophilia, with anyone caught grooming children under 15 online facing 10 years in prison and a €150,000 (approximately $180,000) fine. Previously, French prosecutors could only bring charges of rape or sexual assault if they could prove an adult forced, threatened or tricked a minor into sex.

Also on rt.com France drops plan to set age of sexual consent at 15, triggering outrage & confusion

The new law did carve out an exemption for consensual relations between a minor and a young adult up to five years older – a so-called 'Romeo and Juliet' clause, named after the teens in William Shakespeare’s famous tragedy. Dupond-Moretti defended its inclusion, saying he did not want “to put a youth of 18 on trial because he had consensual sex with a girl aged fourteen-and-a-half.”

A previous attempt by French lawmakers to set the age of consent floundered in 2018. It was inspired by the case of a 28-year-old who was caught having sex with an 11-year-old girl, but was initially not charged with rape. The new law was driven in part by a book published in January this year, however.

In ‘La Familia Grande’, Camille Kouchner accused her stepfather Olivier Duhamel of having abused her twin brother for years, starting when he was 14. She also claimed her mother’s “leftist intellectual friends” – as France24 put it – knew about the abuse, but kept it quiet. The conspiracy of silence apparently included her own father, former foreign minister and Doctors Without Borders (MSF) co-founder Bernard Kouchner.

Duhamel, a prominent political scientist and TV pundit, has since resigned from public life. Earlier this week, French media reported he had confessed to the abuse to police.

Kouchner’s book prompted a Twitter user to publish their own accusation of incestuous abuse with a hashtag #MeTooInceste, which has since gone viral in France.

The European Union said on Friday that Britain should not change trading rules in Northern Ireland on its own and that the bloc would continue its legal case over unilateral British action in the province for as long as necessary.

European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic, who hosted UK negotiator David Frost for talks on Thursday evening, said only agreements by joint bodies established by the Brexit divorce deal could provide stability in Northern Ireland.

The British-ruled province has remained in the EU single market for goods since Brexit to ensure an open border with EU member Ireland and so requires checks on goods coming from other parts of the United Kingdom.

Britain in March unilaterally extended a grace period on certain checks to minimise supply disruption, a move Brussels said breached the Brexit divorce deal known as the Withdrawal Agreement and the specific protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland. read more

Sefcovic said in a statement on Friday there was no space for unilateral action. He said both sides had to agree on how to comply fully with the protocol, including ""clear end-points, deadlines, milestones and the means to measure progress"".

Frost said the British government was committed to working through joint bodies and that all solutions had to respect the Good Friday peace agreement ""in all its dimensions"" and to ensure minimal disruption to everyday lives in Northern Ireland.

Both agreed that Thursday's discussion took place in a constructive atmosphere, that talks needed to intensify and that they would jointly engage with business groups, civil society and others in Northern Ireland.

Frost said some ""positive momentum"" had been established.

Whatever ends up being attached to that metal poker, Americans will love getting it stuck inside of them, squeezed, and then taken out. It will be perfect.” At press time, President Trump brushed off concerns that early trials of the pointy-doctor-jabby-thing had serious, deadly side effects.

0,TuSimple becomes first stand-alone autonomous truck company to go public,https://www.primemovermag.com.au/tusimple-becomes-first-stand-alone-autonomous-truck-company-to-go-public/,"Self-driving truck startup, TuSimple, has raised $USD1.35 billion in a public offering overnight.

The news comes after the San Diego-based company announced earlier in the week that it had launched a roadshow for its initial public offering.

Alongside an existing investor, TuSimple sold an estimated 33.8 million shares at $40 per share in a move viewed as a significant step in helping the company commercialise self-driving trucks and expand its autonomous freight network across the United States.

The company, which has operations in Tucson, Arizona and Shanghai and Beijing in China, wants to achieve SAE Level 4 automated driving across its operations, which would see the vehicle operate autonomously without human input or intervention given the right conditions.

An explosion in eCommerce combined and with a worldwide heavy vehicle operator shortage is fuelling investments in the embryonic driverless delivery segment.

Just this week IVECO signed a memorandum of understanding with autonomous trucking company Plus to jointly develop autonomous trucks.

Last week Volvo Group announced a long-term partnership with self-driving technology company Aurora.

Despite a loss of more than $USD300 million since 2018, TuSimple insists it will see a turnaround in fortunes once production on its self-driving trucks commences in 2024.

According to its IPO filing the company has customer reservations of over 5,700 trucks with the likes of Navistar International and Traton SE among them.

The IPO makes TuSimple the first go-it-alone autonomous truck developer to be publicly traded.

Later this year TuSimple has plans to run a truck without a human safety driver for more than 100 miles day and night as part of its proof of concept for its self-driving technology.

The Traton Group, the parent company of Scania and MAN trucks, acquired the remainder of Navistar International in November, 2020.

TuSimple have already entered into a global partnership to develop self-driving trucks with Traton.

The two companies have agreed to launch a development program to operate the first SAE level 4 autonomous hub-to-hub route between Södertälje to Jönköping in Sweden using Scania commercial vehicles.

“Our partnership with Traton Group accelerates the introduction of autonomous truck technology to new international markets, and we look forward to our global partnership,” said Cheng Lu, TuSimple President.

“The Traton Group has an excellent reputation and established a portfolio of world-class truck brands, their strategic investment in TuSimple is a powerful testimony to our technology and approach.”",395,2621,10,72

He also has the bat version of diabetes. A number of these viruses are only sexually transmitted between bats, so this is extremely concerning. An especially interesting contagion located inside Mr. Giuliani’s chest is linked to the only known fossilized remains of a rare Tibetan bat species, which was buried with the inscription ‘kha rdung pho wang,’ roughly translating to ‘curse of the small winged mammal.’” At press time, Dr. Ellis was struggling to make sense of an abdominal scan of Giuliani, which appeared to show six live bats living comfortably inside his liver.",225,1469,14,92
1,Eloquent Biden Brings Entire Audience To Tears In Debate Stunner,https://politics.theonion.com/eloquent-biden-brings-entire-audience-to-tears-in-debat-1819574033,"'I'm A Flawed Man, But There Is Love In My Heart' Vice President Says

DANVILLE, KY—In what observers called a stunning and unexpected display of oratorical eloquence and candor, Vice President Joe Biden delivered a deeply articulate and heartfelt speech at the conclusion of Thursday night’s vice presidential debate, reportedly moving the entire audience at Centre College to tears.

After moderator Martha Raddatz asked Biden to give his closing statements, the former senator stared down at his prepared statement for several moments before setting it aside, standing on top of the table in front of him, and sharing a series of frank, poignant personal reflections as a surprised and reverent hush fell across the auditorium.

“I know people expect me to embarrass myself right now, or to do something reckless or silly, but I’m not going to do that—not tonight,” said Biden, his voice suddenly tinged with what observers described as a degree of warmth and tender regret never before heard from the veteran politician. “I know how you people see me—the fast cars, the hitchhiking, the trips to Juárez. You know me, ol’ stumbling numbnuts Joe Biden. Right? Well, shit, I’ll be the first to admit that I ain’t no saint. No, sir, I suppose I ain’t much of a role model, either. But when it comes right down to it, even with all my flaws, I am a human being. With hopes, with dreams, and with love in my heart.”

“Go ahead and laugh at Uncle Joe, or call him a fool if you like—I’m not going to stop ya,” Biden continued. “But know that I have a soul, and that my soul bleeds. Hell, I may not always know which way I’m going, or why, but god damn it if I’m not trying the best I can. The everloving best I can.”

Biden then reportedly paused, pulled a carton of cigarettes and a Zippo lighter from his back pocket, lit a cigarette, took a few puffs, and stared silently at the ceiling before once again addressing the audience.

“Listen, I know I’m the last person in the world to give you all a lecture on morality,” said Biden pacing the tabletop as the auditorium lights laid bare every world-weary crease and crevice in his 69-year-old face. “I’ve sure as shit made my fair share of mistakes. I’ve ridden through some pretty dicey places in my Trans-Am, had one or two run-ins with the law, and spent more than a few nights in county. I’ve done things…terrible things. I’ve got a list of regrets a mile wide, and there are nights when those regrets frankly tear me up inside. Just tear me right up.”

“But despite all this, I still have my dignity,” Biden added. “And nobody can take that away from me, no matter what. It’s what keeps me human. It’s what keeps me alive.”

Sources confirmed the Obama campaign was completely taken aback by the vice president’s sudden departure from the expected debate rhetoric, having reportedly instructed Biden to “stick to the issues” and refrain from going off-topic. However, many staffers were said to be incredibly moved by the sincerity of Biden’s words, with senior campaign adviser Robert Gibbs calling it “a revelation” and “a glimpse into the bruised soul of a man who’s lived 10 lifetimes.”

While acknowledging the ongoing criticism of Obama over the past week, a misty-eyed Biden offered an honest and personal account of his running mate while arguing for voters to give the president a second term.

“We’ve been through some crazy times, me and Barry,” said Biden, taking a quick swig from a flask he pulled from the inside pocket of his leather jacket. “He’s caught me on his roof doing some stuff I probably shouldn’t have been doing. Stuff I’m not proud of, despite how cocky I might act. But you know what? I trust him. And he trusts me. I don’t want to make some big political speech up here, but I will tell you right now that Barry’s the guy to lead us. He’s a good fuckin’ man. What’s more, he’s my dear friend. And I love him.”

Sources present at the debate claimed Biden became especially emotional in the middle of his speech when he spotted his wife of 35 years, Jill, in the audience.

“Jesus, Jilly…my beautiful, beautiful Jilly,” said Biden, turning to speak directly to his wife. “Darlin’, I know I haven’t been the perfect husband. Shit, far from it. I’ve done some things with other women that have really put you in a tough spot. But you gotta believe me when I say that I never, ever meant to hurt you.”

“I love you with all my heart, Jilly,” added Biden, who maintained a stoic expression as his eyes welled with tears. “I always have, and I always will.”

Wiping his eyes, Biden finally made a heartfelt appeal to Americans to try, “if they could,” to see “the real Joe.”

“My name is Joseph Robinette Biden Jr.,” said the vice president, his voice choking. “Over the years I have been made an object of mockery and ridicule. I have seen pictures of me in the most humiliating positions you can think of plastered across newspapers all over the world. I have been treated as a punch line. A dope. A fuckin’ jester among kings. But don’t be fooled. I am also a man who has touched sorrow. And I am a son of a bitch who has spent nearly seven decades on the razor’s edge and lived to tell the tale. I may not say it often, and I may never say it again, but I wish to say to you now that I am also a man worthy of love. And worthy of respect.”

“Thank you all so damn much,” Biden added. “I just…I love this country, man.”

Wiping his eyes, Biden then descended from the table and sat back down as the tearful and blindsided audience attempted to make sense of what they had just witnessed.

""If Russia continues to interfere with our democracy, I'm prepared to take further actions to respond. It is my responsibility as president of the United States to do so,"" Biden said from the White House.

""I was clear with President Putin that we could have gone further, but I chose not to do so, I chose to be proportionate,"" Biden said of the measures, adding that he did not want to ""kick off a cycle of escalation and conflict with Russia.""

Biden also said that he proposed in a phone call with Putin that the two meet in person this summer in Europe to discuss a range of pressing issues.

The Biden administration unleashed several sanctions that named 32 Russian individuals and entities for their roles in attempting to influence the 2020 U.S. presidential election, five individuals and three entities linked to Russia's illegal annexation of Ukraine's Crimea, and six technology companies for supporting support Russian Intelligence Services.

In addition, the State Department announced the expulsion of 10 officials from the Russian Embassy in Washington.

Russia has long brushed off allegations of meddling in U.S. elections, human rights abuses, cyberattacks as well as reports of placing bounties on U.S. troops serving in Afghanistan.

Last month, the Biden administration issued its first sanctions on Russia over the alleged poisoning and subsequent detention of Putin critic Alexey Navalny.

Navalny, a leading critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, flew to Russia from Berlin, where he spent nearly half a year recovering for a nerve agent poisoning that took place last August. He was arrested at passport control and later sentenced to more than two years in prison. The U.S. reiterated its calls for his immediate release.

The Kremlin has repeatedly denied having a role in Navalny's poisoning.

But no one ever expected they would be able to vilify them so quickly—and certainly not alongside such a broad assortment of minority strawmen like B lack men and homosexuals. Where once it was common sense that Democrats only needed to say non-college-educated whites were bigots voting against their own self-interest, it now seems they’ll also need to pin electoral failures on Hispanics who refuse to use the term Latinx. It’s a stunning development.” At press time, the Democratic Party had used preliminary analyses of the election’s outcome to draft a series of outcomes telling Latinos how badly they had botched the election for the rest of us.

Don't you know that tomorrow is another day? You're acting like there's a war on, for Pete's sake! And even if there is, you know what? That's something you just can't do anything about.

To focus more on key growth areas like electric vehicle components, connected devices, smart homes, robotics, artificial intelligence, and business-to-business solutions, as well as platforms and services.

LG was earlier the 3rd largest mobile phone producer but has lost market share to Apple, Samsung, Chinese Mobile Companies, and other competitors

Since 2016, LG’s mobile unit had lost around $4.5 billion, so it was expected that soon LG was going to exit the mobile business.

Other factors also played a role like a lack of essential innovation, dull camera tech, inconsistency with hardware faults, software updates poor compared to competitors, and challenges in achieving durable chip supplies.

So from LG will focus much more on its key successful home appliances and OLED TV businesses.

The report, citing experts’ opinion, suggested that tritium released into the sea will be dispersed and diluted in the several years it will take to arrive in South Korean waters.

The South Korean report said there was no problem with Japanese facilities to remove most radioactive substances from water. The possibility that tritium will bring significant exposure to radiation from consuming fisheries products is extremely low, it said.

The report also said that Japan’s evaluation of radiation effects in nearby regions was reasonable.

WASHINGTON – White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Sunday that the Biden administration warned the Russian government to not let jailed Putin critic Alexei Navalny die in custody.

""We have communicated to the Russian government that what happens to Mr. Navalny in their custody is their responsibility and they will be held accountable by the international community,"" Sullivan said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" program.

""We have communicated that there will be consequences if Mr. Navalny dies,"" he added.

Navalny flew to Russia from Berlin earlier this year after spending nearly half a year recovering for a nerve agent poisoning that took place last August. He was arrested at passport control and later sentenced to more than two years in prison.

Last month, the United States sanctioned seven members of the Russian government for the alleged poisoning and subsequent detention of Navalny. The sanctions were the first to target Moscow under Biden's leadership. The Trump administration did not take action against Russia over the Navalny situation.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken wrote in a separate statement that the sanctions would ""send a clear signal"" to Russia that the use of chemical weapons and human rights abuses carry hefty consequences.

""Any use of chemical weapons is unacceptable and contravenes international norms,"" Blinken wrote.

The Kremlin has repeatedly denied having a role in Navalny's poisoning.

A spokesman for Navalny said that the Russian opposition leader's health has deteriorated since his imprisonment. Navalny began a hunger strike in order to force his jailers to provide access to outside medical care for pain in his back and legs. A lawyer for Navalny said he is suffering from two spinal hernias, AP reported.

Russian authorities have previously said that they have offered Navalny proper medical care but that he continues to refuse it. The prison has declined to allow a doctor of Navalny's choice from outside of the facility to administer his treatment.

On Saturday, physician Yaroslav Ashikhmin said that test results he received from Navalny's family show that the jailed critic has elevated levels of potassium, which can trigger a cardiac arrest. Navalny also has heightened creatinine levels that indicate potential kidney failure.

""Our patient could die at any moment,"" Ashikhmin said in a Facebook post.

In an interview with the BBC on Sunday, the Russian ambassador to the U.K. accused Navalny of dramatizing his condition in order to attract attention.

""Of course he will not be allowed to die in prison, but I can say that Mr. Navalny, he behaves like a hooligan, absolutely,"" Andrei Kelin said. ""His purpose for all of that is to attract attention for him, also by saying that today his left hand is sick and tomorrow his leg is sick and all of that stuff so the journalists pay attention.""

""Navalny has been treated in the hospital which lies not so far from the place where he is serving his sentence and as I understand, he does not complain anymore,"" Kelin added.

Last week, the Biden administration slapped Russia with a slew of U.S. sanctions for human rights abuses, sweeping cyberattacks and attempts to influence U.S. elections.

In an address Thursday, Biden said he was prepared to take further actions against Moscow.

""If Russia continues to interfere with our democracy, I'm prepared to take further actions to respond. It is my responsibility as president of the United States to do so,"" Biden said from the White House.

At least one person has been reported killed and several injured after Myanmar security forces opened fire on a pro-democracy protest by medical workers in the city of Mandalay, according to local media on Thursday, with reports of many young demonstrators arrested.

An image posted on social media showed a monk carrying a severely injured man, with two other people assisting him. The person later died, according to a social media post quoting the Mandalay-based Friday Times Journal.

Several photos on social media also showed the military rounding up people on Thursday morning before they could join the protest in the country’s second-largest city.

Medical workers, some of whom have been at the forefront of the campaign against the coup, have gathered early in Mandalay but troops soon arrived to disperse them, opening fire and detaining some people, the Mizzima news agency added.

Mizzima said it did not have details of the number of casualties or arrests.

But among those who were reportedly nabbed by authorities were journalists identified as Ajax and Christopher from Myitkyina News Journal.

Ko Wai Moe Naing, an organiser of anti-military protests in the city of Monywa in Sagaing region was also detained on Thursday, according to the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM).

Images were also posted of several damaged vehicles allegedly destroyed by security forces in Mandalay.

Opponents of the military’s February 1 coup that removed an elected government led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi have kept up their campaign against the military this traditional New Year week with a series of actions and marches.

A spokesman for the military government could not be reached for comment by news agencies.

New Year protest

The coup has plunged Myanmar into crisis after 10 years of tentative steps towards democracy, with daily protests and campaigns of defiance, including strikes by workers in many sectors that have brought the economy to a standstill.

The five-day New Year holiday, known as Thingyan, began on Tuesday but pro-democracy activists cancelled the usual festivities to focus on their opposition to the generals who seized power.

The military says the demonstrations are dwindling but there were reports of flash protests in Sagaing Region as well as in Hpakant township in Kachin State and Kyondoe in Karen State.

In Phayuso township in Kayah State, hundreds of people were seen carrying anti-military government banners, defying warnings by security forces.

Before the latest security crackdown on Thursday in Mandalay, the activist group, Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, had already reported at least 715 protesters killed since the military seized power.

The United Nations human rights office warned on Tuesday that the military clampdown on the protests risked escalating into a civil war, such as Syria’s.

Flagging possible crimes against humanity, the High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet urged countries to take immediate action to push the military to stop its “campaign of repression and slaughter of its people”.

“There are clear echoes of Syria in 2011,” she warned, referring to the start of a civil war that over the past 10 years has killed about 400,000 people and forced more than six million to flee the country.

The military government’s bloody crackdown has brought widespread international condemnation and calls for restraint – as well as sanctions from some countries on the Myanmar armed forces and their extensive business interests.

0,Suspected Islamic militants kill 19 people in Niger village,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/suspected-islamic-militants-kill-19-people-niger-village-77154251,"Officials in Niger say 19 people are dead in the country's troubled region near the border with Mali after gunmen aboard motorcycles attacked a village

NIAMEY, Niger -- Gunmen on motorcycles attacked a village near Niger's troubled border with Mali, shooting at people as they prayed at the mosque during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and killing 19 people, officials said Sunday.

The attack took place Saturday evening in the village of Gaigorou in Niger's Tillaberi region, which has come under repeated attack by suspected Islamic militants since January.

Niger's government called a “cowardly attack by people who claim to be Muslims,” and sent the interior and defense ministers to visit the wounded.

""The government will continue to fight the terrorists without weakness,” Defense Minister Alkassoum Indatou told residents in western Niger on Sunday.

Islamic extremists aligned with the Islamic State group have long been active in Niger, and suspicion quickly fell on the militants earlier this year after gunmen began staging a series of large-scale attacks on civilians near the Malian border.

It began with a January attack on two villages that killed at least 100 people. The following month 237 more were killed in a series of attacks at the hands of armed gunmen aboard motorcycles.

There have been no claims of responsibility for the wave of attacks.

Not only are jihadis active in the Tillaberi region, but the counterterrorism offensives against those extremists have helped give rise to ethnic militias, analysts say. Intercommunal tensions have been exacerbated as a result, particularly near the border between Mali and Niger.

The mounting violence poses a strong threat to Niger's newly inaugurated President Mohamed Bazoum. He was sworn into office earlier this month only days after security forces thwarted an attempted military coup at the presidential palace in the capital of Niamey.

0,Indian drugmaker says U.S. is hoarding vaccine ingredients - Marketplace,https://www.marketplace.org/2021/03/09/indian-drugmaker-says-u-s-is-hoarding-vaccine-ingredients/,"COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers around the world are meeting today to discuss a looming supply chain problem: not enough raw materials and supplies to go around.

And among the countries accused of hoarding these items? The United States.

To speed up vaccine production, the Biden administration has invoked the Defense Production Act. The law, which dates back to World War II, lets government cut to the front of the customer line for critical items made by U.S. companies.

“This essentially enables the U.S. government to tell a supplier to ship the goods, in this case, to Johnson & Johnson,” said Simon Evenett, trade economist at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland. “And those supplies, which were potentially destined to another customer, are of course then diverted.”

Unhappy customers bumped back in the queue include international vaccine makers, effectively blocking exports. The Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine producer, has contracts to produce the AstraZeneca and Novavax vaccines. CEO Adar Poonawalla said at a panel last Thursday that American raw materials are running out.

“There are a lot of bags and filters and critical items that manufacturers need,” Poonawalla said at the event, sponsored by the World Bank. “Now I’ll give you an example: the Novavax vaccine needs these items from the U.S.”

These items are being blocked from export due to Biden administration policy, he said. Marketplace asked the White House for comment, but did not hear back before deadline.

As the whole world ramps up vaccine production, key ingredients could run out.

“Unless production of what’s called the filling stage, as well as the syringes — unless this all scales up, too, there’s a potential for a problem,” Evenett said.

It’s true that the components in short supply are inexpensive, sometimes low-tech items. But until now, there’s been no business case to build more factories to crank them out.

“There’s no market and there’s no margin that will allow capacity to be built up over time,” said Krishna Udayakumar, associate director of the Duke Global Health Institute. “So we really have to invest in building that capacity.”

The looming vaccine material shortage presents the same dynamic as personal protective equipment and ventilator scarcity at the start of the pandemic: a surge in world demand, not enough to go around and countries wanting to keep supplies at home.

Still, Udayakumar defended the Biden administration’s decision to invoke the Defense Production Act for vaccines, allowing drugmaker Pfizer to potentially hit its production target of 2 billion doses by year’s end.

“That certainly is not just for the U.S.,” Udayakumar said. “That’s several times what the U.S. could use. So our ability to ramp up production will allow many other countries to also access those vaccines.”

Still, he said until vaccines are shared around the world, global trade and travel won’t be able to open up.

COVID-19 Economy FAQs Can businesses deny you entry if you don’t have a vaccine passport? As more Americans get vaccinated against COVID-19 and the economy begins reopening, some businesses are requiring proof of vaccination to enter their premises. The concept of a vaccine passport has raised ethical questions about data privacy and potential discrimination against the unvaccinated. However, legal experts say businesses have the right to deny entrance to those who can’t show proof. Give me a snapshot of the labor market in the U.S. U.S. job openings in February increased more than expected, according to the Labor Department. Also, the economy added over 900,000 jobs in March. For all of the good jobs news recently, there are still nearly 10 million people who are out of work, and more than 4 million of them have been unemployed for six months or longer. “So we still have a very long way to go until we get a full recovery,” said Elise Gould with the Economic Policy Institute.

0,"‘That’s a lot of teeth’: 2.5 billion T rex walked the earth, researchers find",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/apr/15/tyrannosaurus-rex-total-population,"One Tyrannosaurus rex seems scary enough. Now picture 2.5 billion of them. That’s how many of the fierce dinosaur king probably roamed Earth over the course of a couple of million years, a new study finds.

Using calculations based on body size, sexual maturity and the creatures’ energy needs, a team at the University of California, Berkeley, figured out just how many T rex lived over 127,000 generations, according to a study in the journal Science on Thursday. It’s a first-of-its-kind number, but just an estimate with a margin of error that is the size of a T rex.

Given uncertainties in the creatures’ generation length, range and how long they roamed, the Berkeley team said the total population could be as little as 140 million or as much as 42 billion with 2.4 billion as the middle value.

“That’s a lot of jaws,” said the study’s lead author, Charles Marshall, director of the University of California Museum of Paleontology. “That’s a lot of teeth. That’s a lot of claws.”

The species roamed North America for about 1.2m to 3.6m years, meaning the T rex population density was small at any one moment. There would be about two in a place the size of the Washington DC, or 3,800 in California, the study said.

“Probably like a lot of people, I literally did a double-take to make sure that my eyes hadn’t deceived me when I first read that 2.5 billion T rexes have ever lived,” said Kristi Curry Rogers, a paleobiologist at Macalester College, who was not part of the study.

Marshall said the estimate would help scientists figure the preservation rate of T rex fossils and underscored how lucky the world was to know about them at all. About 100 or so T rex fossils have been found – 32 of them with enough material to figure they are adults. If there were 2.5 million T rex instead of 2.5 billion, we would probably have never known they existed, he said.

Marshall’s team calculated the population by using a general biology rule of thumb that says the bigger the animal, the less dense its population. Then they added estimates of how much energy the carnivorous T rex needed to stay alive – somewhere between a Komodo dragon and a lion. The more energy required, the less dense the population. They also factored in that the T rex reached sexual maturity somewhere around 14 to 17 years old and lived at most 28 years.

The science about the biggest land-living carnivores of all time was important, “but the truth, as I see it, is that this kind of thing is just very cool”, said James Farlow, a geology professor at Purdue University.",453,2559,14,77

The new, more contagious Brazilian variant, known as P1, seems to be affecting younger people with no pre-existing comorbidities.

Advertising Read more

More than half the patients in Brazilian intensive care units in March were under 40 years old, according to the Brazilian Association of Resuscitation Physicians. The more contagious Covid-19 variant known as P1 is claiming younger victims every day, many with no prior medical issues.

Between January and March the death toll among those between 30 and 39 jumped 353 percent, according to the latest report from the Covid-19 Observatory. At the headquarters of the Fiocruz medical institute, chief pulmonologist Margareth Dalcolmo, who is coordinating the study on the new variant, says not a day goes by without seeing more alarming numbers. And one key question: Why does the Brazilian variant claim more victims among young people?

Dalcolmo and her colleagues already have some clues. ""The profile of seriously ill patients has changed. First, because of the evolution of the pandemic and the lack of lockdown measures, we see more and more young people in the streets. They are the ones who have to go to work and who cannot stand the absence of a social life any longer. So they meet in bars,” she says.

In short, Dalcolmo says, it is not that the new variant prefers young people, but it is the youth who go out and are therefore more exposed.

Widespread poverty has also proven to be a key factor. A monthly government allowance of around €50 per household, introduced at the start of the pandemic, is too low to meet the needs of the poorest families. Faced with this situation, families do the best they can: grandparents stay at home to take care of the grandchildren while parents find themselves outdoors, often congregating on public transport to look for work, predominantly informal jobs.

“It's easy to say to young Brazilians, 'Stay home'. But in practice, and with 20 percent of the population below the poverty line, they have to go out to earn a living,” says Dalcolmo.

Further complicating matters, Brazil has experienced delays in its vaccination rollout due to supply and distribution problems. Only around 8 million people, or 3.8 percent of the population, have so far been fully vaccinated.

‘We cannot stop living’

President Jair Bolsonaro has refused to introduce nationwide lockdown measures. It is therefore left up to individual state governors and mayors to decide for themselves. In a vast country of 27 separate states it has become impossible to have a homogeneous and coherent health policy. Even as São Paulo shuts down, bars and restaurants in Rio de Janeiro were allowed to reopen last weekend until 9pm.

After 14 days of forced closure, the streets of Lapa in Rio are lively. Civil police officers who are on patrol between two crowded terraces look concerned. ""This reopening, I think that's what makes the pandemic gain ground,"" says deputy inspector Gama. Over the past two weeks, Gama and his team have monitored or shut down more than 17,000 bars, social gatherings and underground parties.

The Instagram account @Brasilfedecovid (Brazil stinks of Covid), which has more than 400,000 followers, regularly posts videos and pictures of parties in crowded rooms or on boats. Young revellers appear to be challenging the virus that has prevented them from enjoying events such as Rio's Carnival and a summer of sunshine.

On a fairly empty beach in Rio under the April sun, a few young surfers from the Babilonia favela expound on this view: ""We cannot stop living. We are already risking our lives because of stray bullets or raids by the cops, and on top of that we have to stay at home, left to die, without living or enjoying the sea? We know that the virus is there, but we cannot die at home either.""

This is what worries pulmonologist Dalcolmo and her colleagues: Young people tend to take possible symptoms a little too lightly, and end up arriving at the emergency room much too late. Many fear that the number of hospital deaths – already skyrocketing – hides another reality: that more and more Brazilians, for fear of going to the emergency room, are dying at home.

The feline felon was stopped outside the Nueva Esperanza jail, which houses more than 1,700 prisoners, in the Caribbean province of Colon, north of the capital Panama City.

""The animal had a cloth tied around its neck"" that contained wrapped packages of white powder, leaves and ""vegetable matter"", according to Andres Gutierrez, head of the Panama Penitentiary System.

They were likely cocaine, crack and marihuana, according to another official.

This is not the first such attempted critter crime.

Prisoners use food to lure animals to them, once the creatures had been loaded with drugs by people on the outside.

The office of the drugs prosecutor of Colon said on Twitter it had opened an investigation into the use of animals for smuggling illegal substances into the Nueva Esperanza Prison.

It posted photographs of the drugs, and of the cat caught in the act.

The animal will be taken to a pet adoption center, according to prosecutor Eduardo Rodriguez.

Panama has some 18,000 inmates in 23 prisons, most of them overcrowded.

On previous occasions, authorities have intercepted attempted drug deliveries using homing pigeons and even drones.

The ministry told Geo News that the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority had suspended the social media platforms on its instructions.

The immediate reason for the suspension of services was not clear as of yet.

The action was taken after a letter was sent to the PTA chairman by the interior ministry. The ministry, in the letter, had requested the PTA to take action against the issue ""immediately"".

""I am directed to refer to the subject cited above and to state that complete access to social media platforms may be blocked from 11 am to 3 pm on April 16 2021, across the country,"" Abdul Razaq the Section officer of the ministry wrote in the letter.

""It is requested that immediate action may be taken on the subject matter under the information to this ministry,"" he added.



A PTA official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told Geo News: ""In order to maintain public order and safety, access to certain social media applications has been restricted temporarily.""

However, according to various media reports, social media sites shut down in Lahore as law enforcement agencies expect TLP rioters to hit the streets after Friday prayers.

The TLP is protesting against the arrest of their leader Saad Hussain Rizvi, who was taken into custody earlier this week, and blasphemous caricatures published in France. The protests have turned violent and several casualties have also been reported.

At least three people -- including two policemen -- have been killed in the protests, according to Geo News.

The demonstrators have demanded that the French ambassador be sent home and import of goods from that country banned.

According to media reports, the Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government signed an agreement with the TLP in November last agreeing to expel the French Ambassador.

The TLP launched a massive protest in November last year against the cartoons but dispersed after the agreement with the government to expel the Ambassador by February. The deal was extended until April 20. (ANI)

Over 18,000 Pentagon contractors remain in Afghanistan, while official troops number 2,500. Joe Biden will withdraw this smaller group of soldiers while leaving behind US Special Forces, mercenaries, and intelligence operatives — privatizing and downscaling the war, but not ending it.

(This article was originally published at CovertAction Magazine.)

On April 14, President Joe Biden announced that he would end the U.S.’s longest war and withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan on the 20th anniversary of the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks.

Over 6,000 NATO troops will also be withdrawn by that time.

“War in Afghanistan was never meant to be a multigenerational undertaking,” Biden said during his remarks from the White House Treaty Room, the same location from which President George W. Bush had announced the war was beginning in October 2001. “We were attacked. We went to war with clear goals. We achieved those objectives. Bin Laden is dead and al Qaeda is degraded in Afghanistan and it’s time to end the forever war.”

Biden’s claim that he is ending the forever war is misleading. As The New York Times reported, the United States would remain after the formal departure of U.S. troops with a “shadowy combination of clandestine Special Operations Forces, Pentagon contractors and covert intelligence operatives.” Their mission will be to “find and attack the most dangerous Qaeda or Islamic state threats, current and former American officials said.”

The Times further reported that the United States maintains a constellation of air bases in the Persian Gulf region as well as in Jordan, and a major air headquarters in Qatar, which could provide a launching pad for long-range bomber or armed drone missions into Afghanistan.

Matthew Hoh, a disabled combat veteran who resigned from the State Department in 2009 in protest of the war, stated that a genuine peace process in Afghanistan is “dependent upon foreign forces leaving Afghanistan.”

Further, Hoh said that, “Regardless of whether the 3500 acknowledged U.S. troops leave Afghanistan, the U.S. military will still be present in the form of thousands of special operations and CIA personnel in and around Afghanistan, through dozens of squadrons of manned attack aircraft and drones stationed on land bases and on aircraft carriers in the region, and by hundreds of cruise missiles on ships and submarines.”

Mercenaries R Us

The meaninglessness of President Biden’s announcement becomes apparent when we consider that the Pentagon employs more than seven contractors for every serviceman or woman in Afghanistan, an increase from one contractor for every serviceman or woman a decade ago.

As of January, more than 18,000 contractors remained in Afghanistan, according to a Defense Department report, when official troop totals had been reduced to 2,500.

These totals reflect the U.S. government’s strategy of outsourcing war to the benefit of private mercenary corporations, and as a means of distancing the war from the public and averting dissent, since relatively few Americans are directly impacted by it.

Most of the mercenaries are ex-military veterans, though a percentage are third-country nationals who are paid meager wages to perform menial duties for the military.

One of the biggest mercenary companies is DynCorp International of Falls Church Virginia, which as of 2019 had received over $7 billion in government contracts to train the Afghan army and manage military bases in Afghanistan.

From 2002 to 2013, DynCorp received 69 percent of all State Department funding. Forbes Magazine called it “one of the big winners of the Iraq and Afghan Wars” — the losers being almost everyone else.

A blueprint for U.S. strategy in Afghanistan is the 1959-1975 secret war in Laos, where the CIA worked with hundreds of civilian contractors who flew spotter aircraft, ran ground bases, and operated radar stations in civilian clothes while raising its own private army among the Hmong to fight the pro-communist Pathet Lao.

The CIA and Special Forces have again attempted to recruit tribal elements in Afghanistan and, like in Laos, have become enmeshed in inter-tribal and sectarian feuds.

For years, U.S. Special Forces operatives have also been training Afghan security forces as a proxy army and running Phoenix-style snatch and grab and assassination missions, which are poised to continue — despite the formal troop withdrawal.

What Uncle Sam really wants in Afghanistan

Republican hawk Jim Inhofe lambasted Biden’s withdrawal plan, stating that this was a “reckless and dangerous decision. Arbitrary deadlines would likely put our troops in danger, jeopardize all the progress we’ve made, and lead to civil war in Afghanistan — and create a breeding ground for international terrorists.”

Inhofe it should be noted is a war profiteer. He invested in the stocks of leading arms manufacturer Raytheon at the same time he was calling for an increase in the defense budget as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

Inhofe’s assessment is flawed because, among other reasons, the U.S. has not made much progress in 19 years of war (the Taliban, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, is stronger than at any point since 2001 and controls about one-fifth of Afghanistan), and Afghanistan was never really a breeding ground for international terrorists.

The 9/11 hijackers mostly came from Saudi Arabia, and the Taliban agreed to turn over Osama Bin Laden to an international court after the 9/11 attacks, which they never supported.

The Afghan War will go on indefinitely not because of the threat of terrorism — which is accentuated by the U.S. military presence — but because the United States will not concede ground in the region.

The U.S. has announced intentions to retain at least two military bases in Afghanistan after the official troop drawdown, and set up over 1000 bases during the war.

Uncle Sam also covets Afghans’ mineral wealth. A 2007 United States Geological Service survey discovered nearly $1 trillion in mineral deposits, including huge veins of iron, copper, cobalt, gold, and critical industrial metals like lithium, which is used in the manufacture of batteries for laptops and cellphones.

An internal Pentagon memo stated that Afghanistan could become the “Saudi Arabia of lithium.”

In 2001, when the U.S. first invaded Afghanistan, it was in the process of expanding its military infrastructure in Central Asia. Afghanistan provided a key way-station to this new “oil dorado,” which holds as much as 200 billion barrels of oil — about 10 times the amount found in the North Sea, and a third of the Persian Gulf’s total reserves.

Afghanistan was further valued at the time as a key location for an oil pipeline that would transport Central Asian oil to the Indian Ocean while bypassing Russia.

In the 1990s, the Southern California oil company Unocal began taking steps to build the pipeline, even courting the Taliban. In 2018, ground was broken on a new pipeline project backed by the United States that will carry oil from Turkmenistan to northern India.

The U.S. ruling establishment’s greatest fear is that a complete U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan might result in the U.S. losing a strategic foothold to its main geopolitical rivals, China and Russia.

China has recently increased its trade and investment in Afghanistan — with which it shares a border — and has sought to cultivate better relations with the Afghan government and Taliban.

Russia, meanwhile, reopened a cultural center in Kabul in 2014, rebuilt an abandoned Soviet friendship center, expanded its embassy staff, boosted economic investment, and provided 10,000 Kalashnikov rifles to the Afghan government.

Moscow also supported Afghan housing projects and took advantage of contacts in Kabul to renew ties with ethnic power brokers in the North while quietly courting the Taliban.

As a previous CovertAction Magazine article documented, the current Afghan government led by Ashraf Ghani is largely a creation of the United States. Its military is funded by the United States at a cost of around $4 billion per year. This support is going to continue — unless Congress cuts it off — alongside large-scale U.S. foreign aid programs that amount to nearly $1 billion per year.

The U.S. wants to keep Ghani in power, or replace him with another proxy that can help it win the geopolitical competition with Russia and China, which is little different from the 19th-century “great game” between Great Britain and Czarist Russia.

As long as the U.S. empire remains intact, the war as such will go on, and on — and on.",1384,8654,20,149

Zelenskyy is traveling to Paris to meet with Macron during a working lunch at the Elysee presidential palace. Both heads of state will then talk via videoconference with Merkel, Macron's office said.

The talks come as Ukraine and the West have sounded alarms in recent weeks about the concentration of troops along Russia’s border, a buildup that the U.S. and NATO have described as the largest since 2014.

In an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro, Zelenskyy said “it’s time to stop talking and to make decisions.”

He said Friday's talks notably aim at discussing security issues. “Europe’s security is depending on Ukraine’s security,” he said, adding his country is seeking support from the European Union and the NATO alliance.

“Our goal ... is to de-escalate tensions,” a French official at the French presidency, speaking on condition of anonymity ahead of the talks, said.

“All the work we’re doing is in support of Ukraine’s sovereignty,” the official said.

More than 14,000 people have died in seven years of fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine that erupted after Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula. Efforts to reach a political settlement have stalled, and violations of a shaky truce have become increasingly frequent in recent weeks across Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland known as the Donbas.

0,WhatsApp Online Status Feature Could Let Anyone to Stalk You. Here’s How,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/apps/news/whatsapp-online-status-tracker-flaw-cyberstalking-individual-users-traced-2415074,"WhatsApp has been found to have a flaw that could allow third parties to stalk users, security researchers say. The issue comes through the online status feature of the instant messaging app that is available by default. A list of Android and iPhone apps as well as some Web services are available that exploit the online status feature to let third parties track individuals — without gaining their consent. Cyber-stalkers may use such tracking solutions to keep an eye on WhatsApp users.

Cybersecurity firm Traced has discovered apps and services that could be used by cyber-stalkers to track when a user becomes active on WhatsApp. “You can enter any mobile phone number, and if that person uses WhatsApp, the status tracker will provide the exact date and time that person opened WhatsApp,” the company explained in a blog post.

WhatsApp has provided the online status feature to let people know when you're online. However, unlike features such as Last Seen and Status messages, you don't have the option to disable or change your online status. This is what could be exploited by third parties.

Traced found that many WhatsApp online status trackers market themselves as a solution to help people know when their contacts come online on the app. However, they could simply be used by cyber-stalkers to constantly monitor others.

Some WhatsApp online status trackers are also found to allow users to enter the phone numbers of two individuals. This helps to presume whether both users are chatting with each other on the app at a particular time.

Google doesn't allow cyberstalking apps to be published on its Play store. However, WhatsApp online tracking apps on Google Play pretend as solutions to let parents and spouses know when their loved ones are online on WhatsApp.

This isn't the case with the Web-based online trackers as some of them are promoted clearly as the solution to track individual's WhatsApp accounts.

It is important to note that online trackers can only be used to see when someone uses WhatsApp. This means that the tracking solutions fortunately do not allow an individual to look at their messages or online activity. Third parties also need users' WhatsApp associated phone numbers to track their online status.

Having said that, the way WhatsApp has designed its online status feature appears to be the prime cause to allow this form of cyber-stalking through third-party solutions. When contacted, a WhatsApp spokesperson gave this statement to Gadgets 360:

“We provide a setting to allow people to choose who can view the time a user was ‘last seen' within WhatsApp. To help prevent abuse, we regularly work with app stores to seek the removal of apps that attempt to violate our terms of service. We have banned the WhatsApp accounts associated with such websites, requested Google remove such apps from the Play Store, and also take legal action, as appropriate. Automating WhatsApp's features to scrape information is a violation of our terms of service and we will continue to take action to protect the privacy of our users and help prevent abuse.” - WhatsApp spokesperson

Earlier this week, a WhatsApp vulnerability was discovered that allows attackers to suspend individual accounts remotely by entering their registered phone numbers. The Facebook-owned app is also of late being criticised and questioned for its privacy policy update that will allow sharing of some data with businesses.

In what will come as a major disappointment for fans of the popular high-fantasy RPG, the prolific game developer had just stepped on stage and uttered the words, “I’m thrilled to announce, ” when a truly massive rat—we’re talking, like, the size of a dalmatian, we swear to God—just leaped up from out of nowhere and dragged the screaming Bethesda executive producer into the murky depths. There was some thrashing around for a while, but it ended very, very quickly.

Sadly, it looks like we’re just going to have to continue to wait to hear about the forthcoming adventures on the continent Tamriel since after the brief sounds of a struggle, everything is completely silent. There aren’t even any bubbles escaping from the surface anymore. It’s just the trickling of the water and whisper of the wind outside.

We didn’t even know rats could get that big. Jesus Christ.

While it’s undoubtedly a bummer that we didn’t glean so much as a release date or confirmation about the subtitle of the hotly anticipated sixth title in the Elder Scrolls series, this sudden and violent incident at the Expo serves as a good reminder that life is a fragile and truly precious thing.

The delegate referred to the largest seizure of wood in the history of Brazil. In the document, the police official says that Salles hampered environmental inspection and sponsors private interests.

Saraiva cites evidence of two crimes: administrative advocacy and preventing or hindering investigation of criminal offenses involving a criminal organization.

The Federal Police and Salles have been battling since the day the minister decided to visit the place where the wood was seized, in Pará. At the site, he did some type of verification of the operation and returned a week later, when he participated in a meeting with the owners of the material.

Saraiva told Folha that this is the first time that the minister of the Environment has actively undermined an operation that seeks to preserve the Amazon rainforest.

Chinese will undertake around 200 million trips during the five-day May Day holiday this year, exceeding the pre-coronavirus level at the same period in 2019, according to data from online travel agencies.

The economy-class seats on some air routes are already sold out, said Ctrip and Qunar, the online news portal ThePaper reported.

Big data from Chinese travel service and social-networking platform Mafengwo showed that the seats booked have exceeded the number recorded in same period in 2019, and the ticket price is 1,050 yuan ($160.75) on average, double of that in 2019.

On Ctrip, flight seats booked have increased 23 percent from the same period in 2019, and the ticket price is 1,021 yuan on average. On Qunar, the seats booked have exceeded the number in 2019, 24 times of 2020, and the price is 924 yuan on average, 20 percent increase from 2019.

Mafengwo data showed among the popular routes, Beijing occupies the top spot in outbound cities. Ctrip data showed top 10 destination cities are Shanghai, Beijing, Sanya, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Chongqing, Xi'an, Xiamen, Hangzhou and Shenzhen.

Data from Alibaba's online travel agency platform Fliggy showed that flights from second-tier cities to hot destinations are much cheaper than those from large cities, with an economy-class seat going for 2,250 yuan from Shanghai to Sanya but 570 yuan from Ningbo to Sanya.

As far as hotel reservations are concerned, Ctrip data showed that rooms booked for May Day holiday increased by 43 percent from the same period in 2019 and rooms of some top hotels are all booked.

Lan Xiang, Qunar's data research director, said that hotel reservations have increased during this year's Spring Festival period due to the travel demands after the restraints.

""Although many people visited relatives and travel during the Qingming Festival, many are still choosing to travel during the May Day holiday because of the length of the holiday,"" Lan said.

According to the vacation rental provider Airbnb, as of April 5, searches for rooms available from April 30 to May 4 at large cities and hot tourist destinations were about 10 times of that in 2020.

Under the premise of continuous effective epidemic prevention and control, some tourist spots in Shanghai, Zhengzhou of Central China's Henan province and Sichuan province have started to cancel the limits of visitors.

Ctrip data showed that as of April 14, people booking tickets at tourist spots increased by 114 percent from 2019, and the online platform predicted that ticket booking will enter an explosive period in next two weeks.",447,2766,10,56

Just imagine the arguments: ‘Oh, you demand that I clean the dishwasher? You don’t know anything about demand!’ You’d have the Friedmanite, Doug, trying out all these crazy schemes to try to earn money through supply-side market manipulation. And when the Keynesian, Jeff, is trying to find a job, Doug keeps telling him that the government doesn’t owe him employment. But of course they’d learn things from each other too over the course of the show—the Keynesian would soften his stance on aggregate demand, and the Friedmanite would admit that maybe he could stand to be a little bit more understanding about deregulation. They’ll also have this crazy Hispanic communist neighbor who both of them are constantly trying to get to move out. Plus we could get cool guest stars, like Alan Greenspan!” At press time, the studio had passed over Stephens’ sitcom idea in favor of a single-camera show by a psychologist where a Freudian and a Skinnerian have to live together.

Figures including author J.K. Rowling, actors Benedict Cumberbatch and David Duchovny called on Putin to offer Navalny, who is currently on a hunger strike, immediate medical treatment.

""As we write, Alexei Navalny is being held in a penal colony that many lawyers and human rights activists consider to be one of the harshest in Russia,"" the letter said.

""Alexei Navalny is exhibiting symptoms of a severe neurological disorder — constant back pain and the loss of sensation in his legs and hands. In addition, he is suffering from a severe cough and fever. As a Russian citizen, he has the lawful right to be examined and treated by a doctor of his choice.""

The open letter was published in Le Monde newspaper in France, The Economist, La Repubblica in Italy and Der Spiegel.

Putin 'must keep the law'

""We call on you, Mr. President, to ensure that Alexei Navalny is immediately given the medical treatment and care that he urgently requires — and is entitled to under Russian law. As someone who has sworn to uphold the law, you have only to do so,"" the letter said.

Later on Saturday, US President Joe Biden condemned Navalny's situation as ""totally, totally unfair,"" and ""totally inappropriate.""

Concerns over Navalny's deteriorating health

Navalny's personal doctor Anastasia Vasilyeva said Navalny ""can die any minute,"" in a post on Facebook on Saturday, pointing to high potassium levels.

She said he should be moved into an intensive care station, adding ""fatal arrhythmia can develop any minute.""

Vasilyeva and three more doctors including cardiologist Yaroslav Ashikhmin have asked prison officials to grant them immediate access.

On Monday, Navalny's aides said that prison officials were threatening to force-feed him as he conducts his hunger strike. He also said that authorities at the penal colony where he is being held had refused him proper treatment for acute back pain.

Navalny, who is Putin's most vocal opponent, survived a poisoning attack with the nerve agent Novichok last August. He was arrested in January of this year after returning to Russia from Germany, where he was treated for the poisoning. He was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison on prior embezzlement charges. His case has since become a sticking point for proponents of democratic values and human rights in Russia.",407,2500,10,60
0,‘Single-use plastics’ to be phased out in Australia from 2025 include plastic utensils and straws,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/16/single-use-plastics-to-be-phased-out-in-australia-from-2025-include-plastic-utensils-and-straws?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other,"Plastic cutlery and straws are among the types of single-use plastics to be phased out in Australia from 2025 under a plan to reduce plastic waste.

A national meeting of environment ministers on Thursday confirmed the phase-out would cover eight types of “problematic and unnecessary” plastic waste: lightweight plastic bags; plastic misleadingly labelled “degradable”; plastic utensils and stirrers; plastic straws; polystyrene food containers; polystyrene consumer goods packaging; and microbeads in personal care products.

The Australian government previously announced plans to phase out “single-use plastics” by the end of 2025, including banning the use of expanded polystyrene food containers by December 2022. But now federal, state and territory leaders have agreed on what that term will cover.

Conservationists have warned, however, the ambition will not be met unless the voluntary industry targets are backed up by tough regulation.

Queensland has passed laws to ban plastic straws, cutlery, plates, stirrers, and polystyrene food containers, with the legislation to take effect from September.

Thursday marked the first national environment ministers meeting since November 2019. A joint communique released on Thursday night said the ministers also agreed in principle to support a rollout of food organics and garden organics waste collection services, and to a “harmonisation of municipal waste collection” including new standards for kerbside waste collection.

Australia produces 2.5m tonnes of plastic waste each year, about 84% of which is sent to landfill. About 130,000 tonnes of plastic waste leaks into the environment annually.

Darren Kindleysides from the Australian Marine Conservation Society said national agreement on the types of single-use plastics covered by the ban would give businesses certainty and ease consumer confusion.

“This is welcome progress on these killer plastics and will help to ease the pressure on our marine wildlife,” he said. “We would urge our governments to take the further step of implementing national mandatory bans to ensure the good progress in some jurisdictions continues.”

According to the communique, the ministers also discussed “the vital role cooperation will play in building a more climate-resilient Australia” and a federal government promise to engage with state and territory governments in the lead-up to the Cop26 Glasgow climate change conference. It did not mention any specific strategies for emission reduction.

The ministers also agreed to support the national koala monitoring program.

Suzanne Milthorpe, the national environment laws campaigner for the Wilderness Society, had hoped for more action in response to the findings of the royal commission into national natural disaster arrangements and the review of Australia’s federal environment laws, both of which were handed to the government in 2020.

“There is a lot of ‘noting’ and ‘discussing’ but not a lot of acting, especially on behalf of the commonwealth,” she said.

Milthorpe criticised the federal government for failing to provide a formal response to the review of Australia’s environmental laws by Prof Graeme Samuel, who called for a major overhaul of the regulatory system.

“What is clear from the Samuel Review is that state and commonwealth governments must work together to raise the standard of environmental protection in Australia,” she said. “There is a reality gap between the current discussions and what is required to ensure icons like the koala and the Great Australian Bight have a future.”

The Samuel review made 38 recommendations to change the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act including the immediate introduction of legally-binding national standards. A draft of the proposed standards was included in the review.

The Morrison government instead drafted its own version of the interim standards, which were described by Senate crossbenchers as “substantially weaker” than those recommended by Samuel.

The communique said state and territory ministers “noted the national cabinet priority to introduce national environmental standards reflecting the current requirements of the EPBC Act”.

It said the ministers “noted the commonwealth’s commitment to subsequent phases of reform” and its “undertaking to provide a timeline for subsequent phases of reform”.

Basha Stasak from the Australian Conservation Foundation said she would welcome seeing that timeline – given the urgency of the Samuel review.

“The government’s proposed interim national standards are incredibly vague and weak and they really need to be disposed of,” Stasak said. “Any consultation that’s going to take place with the states and territories needs to be starting from scratch and based off the draft interim standards in Prof Samuels’ report.”",717,4827,15,97

1,Trump Supporters Fighting Over Used Tissues President Tossed From SUV,https://www.theonion.com/trump-supporters-fighting-over-used-tissues-president-t-1845276433,"BETHESDA, MD—Clawing at each other as they grabbed up his discarded, mucus-filled wipings, supporters of President Donald Trump reportedly fought over the used facial tissues he tossed from his SUV Sunday as his motorcade passed by outside Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. “Fuck you, that one’s mine!” said Lewis Reynolds, a 33-year-old presidential well-wisher who was seen exchanging blows with other Trump fans as they brawled in the street to secure possession of one of the dozen or so crumpled-up and fully saturated tissues. “Give it back! He was looking at me when he threw it out. I was standing right here waiting to catch it during his whole coughing fit, and then you swooped in at the last second and stole it from me!” Having emerged from the struggle with a tissue to take home, a visibly excited Reynolds told reporters he would be preserving it for posterity and was “never going to wash [his] hands again!”",159,937,10,69
0,AstraZeneca: a second Canadian had a blood clot after receiving the vaccine,https://thecanadian.news/2021/04/17/astrazeneca-a-second-canadian-had-a-blood-clot-after-receiving-the-vaccine/,"Alberta has announced that a man suffered from a rare blood clot after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine, confirming the second such case to occur in the country.

The province’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr Deena Hinshaw, said the patient, who is in his 60s, was recovering. He is the second Canadian to experience this rare disease, called “vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia” (TIPIV).

The news does not change the province’s risk assessment of the vaccine, she said in a statement.

Dr Hinshaw still recommends AstraZeneca’s vaccine for people 55 and over and suggests that all Albertans get the vaccine “as soon as they can.”

Over 700,000 doses of AstraZeneca have been administered in Canada to date.

Globally, the incidence rate of TIPIV is estimated to be about one in 100,000 to 250,000 doses, Hinshaw said.

By comparison, she says, Albertans 55 and older who catch COVID-19 have a one in 200 chance of dying from the infection.

A Quebecer was the first in the country to develop a blood clot after receiving the vaccine.

The woman had received the “Covishield” vaccine, the Oxford-AstraZeneca formula made in India at the Serum Institute, and was recovering at home, the Public Health Agency of Canada said.

“Although every adverse reaction is unfortunate, it is important to remember that these blood clots are extremely rare and this vaccine helps prevent the much higher risks that come from infection with COVID-19,” recalled the Dr. Hinshaw.",240,1488,12,75
