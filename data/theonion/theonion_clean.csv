Dear Worker Bee #7438-F87904,

My husband and I split last year after 11 years of marriage. We’re still good friends, though, and we even go out for coffee once a week. Problem is, lately, he’s been seeing a new person, someone I feel is definitely not right for him. Should I say anything? I’m not jealous—I know I wasn’t right for him, either. What’s my move?

I work in a large office, and I think I’m in love with the woman who works in the next cubicle. I’m wary of office romance, though. I mean, what if things don’t work out? That could make for a pretty uncomfortable work environment. But I really like this woman. Could the answer be as simple as switching cubicles if things don’t work out? Or am I just giving myself an excuse to do something I suspect may be wrong?

And I let them know, even if things do get serious, the most they’d ever have to deal with is an occasional visit to lay flowers at her graveside.” Dugas added that even if she found the right man, she had no plans to have any living children of her own since she knew she’d be a pretty terrible mother.

1,This aged very well,https://local.theonion.com/ghost-of-christmas-future-taunts-children-with-visions-1819566694,"SOUTHFIELD, MI—Bored with scaring elderly misers, the Ghost of Christmas Future is spending the holiday season taunting modern children with visions of Christmas 2016's hottest toy: the Sony PlayStation 5, a 2,048-bit console featuring a 45-Ghz trinary processor, CineReal graphics booster with 2-gig biotexturing, and an RSP connector for 360-degree online-immersion play.

The Ghost of Christmas Future offers a pair of Phoenix 10-year-olds a tantalizing glimpse of the PS5.

Advertisement

""You know how kids are—a year is an eternity to them,"" the wraithlike specter said Monday during a visit to the Southfield home of 13-year-old Josh Kuehn. ""So just imagine showing them something they'll have to wait 14 years for. Teasing them with a glimpse of the PS5 is the ultimate torture. They absolutely lose their minds. It's like saying, 'Hey, kid, you'll be an old man before you ever get to touch this.'""

The Ghost of Christmas Future said he has visited more than 125,000 homes since Thanksgiving, offering children an agonizing sneak peek at what they cannot have for another decade and a half.

""I like to appear in the living room with a PS5 hooked up to 2016's most popular TV, the 4'x8' Hi-Def Sony Titania,"" the Ghost said. ""Then, I'll say in my best spooky voice, 'Jimmy! Behold what your kids will be playing while you're slaving away at an office job to support them!'""

Driving the children mad with PS5 lust, the Ghost said, is a multi-step process.

""I usually start by showing them Toteki Aluminum, one of the future's most popular fight-and-chase games,"" the Ghost said. ""It's far from the best available in 2016, but it always blows their mind to see the guy get hit with the falling sign while the drops of sweat fly off his face. You can see the whole scene, distorted, in each of the individual drops. That gives them a good preliminary idea of the graphics technology we're dealing with.""

The Ghost said he then likes to show Airsledz, a racing game in which jet-powered sleds whoosh through a four-dimensional racing course in the sky. The game, he said, enables the player to compete online against dozens of other players all around the world.

""They always ask if you can play it on the Internet—it's so cute how they still call it 'the Internet'—and I tell them, 'Hey, you can play this against 63 other PS5 owners simultaneously. At least you can in 14 years,'"" the Ghost said. ""And you should see their jaws hit the floor when they learn about the add-on accessories that enable users to actually fly around the room during gameplay.""

Once the capabilities of the system are conveyed to the children, the Ghost likes to push them further over the edge by showing them games specially targeted to their age group.

Aaron Booker of Dayton, OH, samples the PlayStation 5.

Younger children, he said, salivate upon seeing Level One of Zonic Fugue. In it, Zonic, the indigo-colored son of Sonic The Hedgehog, faces off against Chuckles The Echidna in a Terrordactyl sky-joust, attempting to earn the Ankle Rockets he needs to gather the five Chaos Sapphires that, when combined, form the master key that opens the Melody Dome.

To break the spirits of children 12 and up, the Ghost runs a brief demonstration of Back To Werewolf Island. The horror-action thriller, he said, will be produced in full 10.8 Omneo sound and feature new music from 40 of 2016's hottest skagcore acts, including FU3P, Dredgerous, and Frances Cobain.

Advertisement

""Sometimes, the kids will start getting defensive and say, 'Yeah, well, I don't know any of those characters, so big deal,'"" the Ghost said. ""That's when I pull out DC vs. Marvel.""

The Ghost said he shows the children a brief clip of DC vs. Marvel, in which cinema-realistic figures of Spider-Man and the Joker dash across impossibly detailed city streets, attacking each other with dozens of different offensive maneuvers while leaping, somersaulting, and throwing objects.

Advertisement

""They usually start trembling at that point,"" the Ghost said. ""That's when I go in for the kill by casually mentioning that the game comes packaged with the 2016 feature film of the same name—not on DVD, of course, but on SCAP. Ten times better.""

The few children unbroken by DC vs. Marvel are invariably finished off by the sight of Star Wars—Episode IX: Jedi Destiny, a game which employs the world's most advanced artificial-intelligence algorithm to place the player inside the film's climactic battle sequence on the planet Mon Jeedam.

""With more than 12,000 distinct soldiers, creatures, and vehicles fighting at once, and the option to command the New Republic Fleet, the Imperial Armada, or the Yuuzhan Vong Invasion Force, it's not merely the best Star Wars game that's ever existed; it's an interactive film that looks better than any movie that's ever been made. No child has failed to sob hysterically at the sight of it.""

1,Bush Calls For Panic,https://politics.theonion.com/bush-calls-for-panic-1819570290,"WASHINGTON—In a nationally televised address to the American people Wednesday night, President Bush called upon every man, woman, and child to spiral uncontrollably downward into complete and utter panic.

President Bush addresses the nation shortly before shaving his head and soaking the Oval Office in his own urine.

Advertisement

Speaking from the Oval Office, Bush assured citizens that in these times of great uncertainty, the best and only course of action is to come under the throes of a sudden, overwhelming fear marked by hysterical or irrational behavior.

""My fellow Americans, the time for running aimlessly through streets while shrieking and waving our arms above our heads is now,"" Bush said. ""I understand that many of you are worried about your economic future and our situation overseas, and you have every right to be. Yet there is only one thing we as a nation can do in times like these: give up all hope and devolve into a lawless, post-apocalyptic, every-man-for-himself society.""

""For those of you who have remained resolute in your belief that things will turn around eventually, I urge you to close your eyes, take shallow rapid breaths, and begin freaking out immediately,"" Bush added. ""At this point, anyone who isn't scared to death needs to wake the fuck up—because we're screwed here.""

The Department of Homeland Security's website provides information for Americans not currently losing their shit. <a href=""http://www.theonion.com/content/news/bush_calls_for_panic"">Read More</a>

The president then picked up the telephone from his desk and hurled it through the Oval Office window.

During the address, Bush laid out a historic five-point plan for panic that he hopes will help the American people fall apart as quickly as possible. The plan—which many are calling Bush's most well-thought-out proposal to date—calls for citizens to abandon their daily routines entirely, and engage in a weeklong period of bloodcurdling screaming, arm flailing, dry heaving, and gnawing on one's fingers while rocking back and forth in alternating bouts of maniacal laughter and gentle sobbing.

Advertisement

Under the new bill, Americans are also advised to withdraw all their money from U.S. banks and the stock market, place it in a Maxwell House coffee tin, and bury it in a safe place in their backyard. In addition, Bush has urged the legalization of Americans trampling one another in a mad rush to compete for the nation's dwindling resources, and proposed allocating $3 billion toward a program that would give every citizen a gun and a bottle of 140-proof whiskey.

The final part of the plan calls for the immediate release of all convicted felons and death-row inmates from the nation's prisons.

Advertisement

Immediately after Congress approves his plan, the president said he will order multiple B-2 stealth bombers to fly over America's cities at low altitude. The resulting sonic boom, Bush said, will set off all car alarms and cause all babies to cry uncontrollably, which he believes will promote a real sense of chaos throughout the nation. In addition, Bush intends to release 50 live cobras into the Senate chamber.

""I realize this is a difficult vote for members of Congress, but at this critical time in our nation's history, it is imperative that we not sit back and pretend like everything is fine, because everything's not fine, it's just not,"" Bush said. ""Even if Congress fails to act, I still intend to do what is right and lead this country into mass hysteria by acting outside the framework of the U.S. Constitution, overriding the entire democratic process, and setting the Lincoln Memorial on fire.""

Advertisement

Early reactions on Capitol Hill to Bush's call for panic have thus far been positive. Leading House Republicans and Democrats said they appreciate the president's candor, and will encourage their constituents to comply with Bush's request to ""find something and smash it with all of their strength.""

""For most of the day tomorrow, I intend to do my part by remaining in my boarded-up home and getting worked up about our standing in the world,"" Pacoima, CA resident Harold Miller said. ""And then at night, I plan to lie awake in my bed and be scared to death about the loss of my job, pension, and retirement fund. Then I plan to run out into the streets in my bathrobe and shout that the End of Days is coming.""

Bush told Americans that if at any point they catch themselves feeling even slightly at ease, they should remind themselves that, in the end, everything is going to be completely fucked.",750,4596,4,20
1,Christ Returns to NBA,https://www.theonion.com/christ-returns-to-nba-1819563859,"After a two-year hiatus, Jesus Christ returned to the NBA last night, taking the court with his former team, the Atlanta Hawks. Christ, who quit the sport in May 1994 to focus on spreading His message of universal love and compassion, made His triumphant return last night against the Bulls, just in time for Easter Sunday.

Jesus Christ returned to action last night against the Chicago Bulls, chipping in 13 points and 4 assists, and wowing fans with his trademark ""Ascension Dunk.""

Advertisement

The return of Christ, who averaged 18.2 points and 7.3 assists per game during his 10-year NBA career, has excited success-hungry Hawks fans, who are calling Him the team's ""Savior.""

Said Atlanta resident and devout Christian Jeff Voorhees, ""Jesus is Lord.""

Christ's decision to return to the Hawks surprised insiders, considering that for years the Nazareth native had been crucified by the Atlanta press. Since He was drafted third overall out of Texas A&M in 1986, Christ has been labeled too passive and forgiving to ever lead the Hawks to the promised land. Christ, however, has now apparently decided to turn the other cheek.

""I forgive Atlanta Journal-Constitution sportswriter Stan Sheridan,"" Christ said. ""He knows not what he writes.""

The closest Christ came to signing with another team came in December, when He spent 40 days and 40 nights in the desert with Detroit Pistons coach Doug Collins. After consulting His father, God, Christ turned down the Pistons' offer of 30 gold pieces.

""Get thee behind me, Coach Collins,"" Christ reportedly said.

Though some say the media led Christ to quit basketball, many contend He quit after being betrayed by teammate Kevin Willis during a 1994 Celtics-Hawks playoff game. With three seconds left and the Hawks trailing by one, Christ was wide open underneath the basket for an easy layup. Instead of passing to Christ, Willis took a wild shot from three-point range, missing the net completely. After the game, a visibly upset Christ stretched out His arms and said, ""Kevin Willis, why hast thou forsaken me?""

Advertisement

Despite the controversies, Hawks teammates and personnel are excited to have Christ back.

Advertisement

Forward Stacey Augmon, just one of many Hawks players who claims to have a personal relationship with Christ, said, ""He's taught me so much, like how to love your enemies as yourself, to pray for those who hurt you, and when to pass up the three in favor of a higher percentage shot.""

Fans also eagerly await the return of Christ's ""Ascension Dunk,"" a crowd favorite. In the patented move, Christ leaps His less-than-league-average 24-inch vertical, and miraculously ascends toward Heaven, floating in mid-air just long enough to stuff the ball. An accompanying angelic choir momentarily stuns His defenders as the ball comes crashing down on their heads. The move wowed audiences and judges at NBA All-Star Slam-N-Jam dunk competitions two years in a row.

Advertisement

A three-time NBA All-Star, Christ impressed team doctors during a brief, closed-door workout Friday, in which He displayed His still-sharp shooting skills, dribbling ability, and overwhelming love for all mankind.

Team doctors also noted that in contrast to most players who take layoffs, Christ's body fat is just three percent, even lower than when He was playing. Christ attributed the low figure to His recent food-free, 2,000-year out-of-body reign in His Father's Kingdom.

Advertisement

Meanwhile, the league made a special ruling regarding Christ's crown of thorns, deciding that He may wear the headpiece only so long as He does not unwittingly anoint a player with the forgiving power of His Holy Blood.

Though Hawks fans seem certain Christ can help the team, some NBA experts question whether Jesus is the way.

Advertisement

""The healing power of His Holy Love may get the Hawks into the playoffs, but they can't ride that alone to the championship,"" NBA commentator Hubie Brown said. ""What they really need is a solid power forward who can fill the lane, someone like Cliff Robinson.""

Some analysts think that Christ's injuries, along with His added age, may slow Him down.

Advertisement

""Christ isn't going to be 32 forever, and, quite frankly, He hasn't been the same since the Romans drove holes into His hands and feet,"" NBA analyst and former coach Chuck Daly said. ""A painful stigmata injury is difficult to overcome, and it may affect His shooting touch. Still, I'm pretty confident He can rise again.""",731,4496,4,21

1,Jean Teasdale is back!,https://www.theonion.com/welfare-check-1846085921,"How glad I am that that absolute heckscape known as 2020 is finally over! Whew! I don’t care if the year made the greatest novelty New Year’s eyeglasses of my lifetime! 2020? More like two-oh-two-NO! (No offense intended to anyone who had a great 2020.)

Advertisement

Yes, your old pal Jean survived 2020! And the five years before that, too, it should go without saying. Apparently there were a few Jeanketeers who were wondering what I’ve been doing since Trump was elected, or if anyone had even checked on me. Thanks for asking, I think? Frankly, I’m a little surprised that you don’t already know from my steady string of “A Room Of Jean’s Own” columns that I’ve been alive and kicking this whole time. Am I to infer that you overlooked such modern-classic Teas-tales as “Choco-LATE For Work Again,” “Just Try To Tear Me Away From My Fidget Spinner,” “Jean Ranks The Shades Of Pink,” and “Can You Dia-Beat That?” Then again, I don’t often get The Onion sent to me in the mail—in fact, I’m having a hard time even remembering the last time I saw a print copy—so I can’t say with complete certainty that all of these columns got published. No worries! As long as the kill-fee checks arrive in the mailbox, this gal ain’t complaining!

Speaking of checks, how about that stimulus moolah? Never thought I’d see the day when the government paid us pennies on the dollar to stay home during a pandemic! Maybe some of you consider it no more than a welfare check, but I choose to see it as well-deserved partial compensation for my selfless efforts to invigorate our local economy. Not to get all political (yecch!), but think of all the glitter lip balm and scented candle buys that would have collected dust on the store shelves if not for me. I don’t impulse shop as much these days because the Walmart is over an hour away from us (RIP Shopko Hometown, which will always be Pamida in my heart!). Plus, Hubby Rick warned me if I so much as I lay an eye on the Pioneer Woman aisle, he’ll drive off without me and I’ll catch the “China virus” on the Uber trip home. (Yes, he’s still an epic grouch, and yes, sheesh-o-rama! And no, he hasn’t died—another question Jeanketeers ask too (??).)

It was pretty scary when we couldn’t pay our rent for a couple months. Eventually, even cars and trucks in a pandemic cry out for new tires, and Hubby Rick eventually went back to work at the tire center, company-mandated mask and all. (Boy, did he grumble about that!)

Jeanwhile, I was still grinding away at the Riverside Indoor Flea Market for my pal Fulgencio’s thrift-find stall ¡Basura Fabuloso! when the lockdowns began and the place closed. Of course it was horrifying, but can I also admit that I was a little relieved? Things were getting a little hot under the collar because Fulgencio was still cross at me about that big shipment of old, unsold Ben Franklin store stock that disappeared on my watch, or lack of watch, just days before. I figured, what was the harm of letting a few packed boxes sit out overnight in front of the locked stalls? The wheel of our hand truck was sticking, and I refuse to bend at the waist after 2 p.m. It’s a rule I have! Besides, every story I had heard about stuff being stolen from the flea market involved shoplifting by customers, and besides besides, who would swipe a whole case of 45-year-old pantyhose still in their original packaging, T-shirt iron-ons, and hairdo tape? Turns out, somebody! But when the flea market reopened in June, Fulgencio was so pleased and he never said anything when I showed up for work as usual. Whoo-hoo!

Everyone else working at the flea market is happy to be back, the ones who returned, that is. The milk-paint furniture stall? Gone. The booth that only sold license plates and iron doorstops? Gone. But the lady that sells fudge and that gritty Turkish delight is still around. (It would probably take, like, triple coronavirus wrapped in two tornadoes to get rid of her!) For all their relief, the vendors agree that despite the re-open, the customers seem grouchier too. It must be from all the stress we’ve been feeling. Still, nothing prepared me for this encounter with a real-life Karen lady!

I know, the smart Alecs and Alexises among you are asking, “But Jean, aren’t you a Karen lady?” Wash out your mouth with soap! (Preferably from my flea market bestie Jane’s goat’s-milk soap booth—she said if I mentioned it, she’d give me a nail brush!) Oh, I know all about the Karen ladies. But anyone who truly knows Jean Teasdale sees that I’m not an aggressive and confrontational sort. I guarantee you that if anyone ends up in defensive tears at the customer service counter, it’s me! And I always leave the manager-speaking-to to Hubby Rick. Now that I think about it, Rick doesn’t get much of anywhere either. Sure, he once got a free pizza delivered to our door by that pizzeria manager, but it also came with a punch in the eye. Not sure what Rick said to him on the phone to get that shiner, but it must have been a lulu!

Advertisement

Anyway, there I was, minding my (well, Fulgencio’s) business, when this lady kind of sauntered into the stall and glared at me. I said, “Hi, can I help you?” in my perkiest voice, and instead of perking back, she says, “Shouldn’t someone clean that up?”

I didn’t know what she was referring to, and when I asked what it was, and she snorted and said “You don’t know? I almost fell on my heinie [I apologize for the vulgarity—Jean]. That violates health codes.”

Advertisement

Before I could react, she added. “Someone could sue. Would you like to get sued?” I was stunned. No, I would not like to get sued! I was lucky enough to keep my job after that stolen boxes incident! Trembling a little, I craned my neck over the stall. After some scanning, I spotted a kind of pinkish-greenish smear on the floor that looked like frosting or spackle or something. When I took a closer look, I noticed that it was a big lump of Turkish delight! I guess someone disliked the taste of it and just dropped it on the floor. (That happens once in a while.)

“Clean that up,” she barked. I gulped. “I’m truly sorry about that,” I replied, flustered. “I’ll go get the custodian.” “What’s wrong with you doing it?” she demanded without a pause. “You’re right here. Take care of it yourself.”

Advertisement

I balked a little. “That stuff is not from my stall, and I’d really rather not,” I said. That’s when she asked me for a phone number to call whoever oversees the whole flea market. Yes, she wanted to speak to the manager! Well, I kind of froze. I don’t know what it is about these Karen ladies, but they’re so fearsome and commanding! I was hypnotized. Her face was all stone. For a split second, it seemed to turn into my mother’s face. (And of course all this time, several of my fellow stall operators are looking on, totally frozen, not saying a word or getting involved, including the Turkish delight lady!)

Somehow through the panic, I remembered that there was a mop and bucket in the customer bathroom a few yards away. I bolted over there, hauled out the mop and bucket and the caution sign shaped like a little kid, and started swabbing furiously at the goo. Unfortunately, the water in the bucket was already gray and dirty, and I was just making a bigger mess. I know this, because I heard the Karen lady say “You’re just making a bigger mess.” I told her I’d go get some cleaner, but I didn’t see any in the bathroom, so I just jerked some hand soap into my hand, ran back to the mess, and squeezed it onto the floor. Well, I don’t need to go into more detail. Except that I was so determined to mop that mess clean that I didn’t notice her walk away. Boy, is it hard to breathe out of a mask when you’re hyperventilating. But ends up I left her at a loss for words. Pretty unique for a Karen lady situation! As far as I know, she never spoke to the manager. I think his name is Jeff. (I will find out for the next column.)

Advertisement

Incidentally, I didn’t pick up on it until later that the Karen lady wasn’t wearing a mask . It’s flea-market policy, and I always feel sheepish asking someone to put one on. I know some people go off on how it violates their rights, but in truth, I’m the least political person in the world. Start talking about that stuff to me, and I can’t guarantee I won’t loudly chant “MmmBop,” my go-to unwanted-thought-expelling happy tune. But some hazards are hard for us essential flea-market workers to avoid!

Anyway, let’s all wish for a better 2021! Hopefully they will develop a vaccine for grouchiness, too—some people could really use it!",1556,8615,4,22

1,Nation's Experts Give Up,https://politics.theonion.com/nations-experts-give-up-1819565216,"WASHINGTON, DC—Citing years of frustration over their advice being misunderstood, misrepresented or simply ignored, America's foremost experts in every field collectively tendered their resignation Monday.

Left: Child-rearing expert Dr. Patrick Coughlin and Korean War expert Dr. Laurence Block field reporters' questions following the mass resignation of America's 243,839 experts.

""Despite all our efforts to advise this nation, America still throws out its recyclables, keeps its guns in unlocked cabinets where children have easy access, eats three times as much red meat as is recommended, watches seven hours of TV per day, swims less than 10 minutes after eating, and leaves halogen lights on while unattended,"" said Dr. Simon Peavy, vice-president of the National Association of Experts. ""Since you don't seem to care about things you don't understand, screw you. We quit.""

""My final piece of expert advice,"" Peavy added, ""is that all of you people should just go fuck yourselves.""

Michael Leland, until recently a Department of Energy advisor specializing in planetary energy-use infrastructures and a leading expert in petrochemical and fossil-fuel depletion, maintained that the experts' mass resignation is justified.

""Last year, I testified before Congress that at the current rate of consumption, the planet's supply of coal, natural gas and oil would be gone within 40 years, and they looked at me as if I was some sort of crackpot,"" Leland said. ""What's the point?""

""We'll say it one last time before we pack up and go: In 20 years, you'll be up to your asses in old folks,"" a written statement from the National Advisory Council On Aging read in part. ""Since America has not yet begun making preparations for the explosion in its senior population, we recommend that you begin research on federally funded, hydroelectrically powered 'eldercution camps,' where the teeming hordes of the aged can be disposed of quickly and painlessly.""

According to Peavy, despite the vast amounts of scientifically proven and historically sound advice provided by the nation's experts, the National Association of Experts could cite no instances of advice being followed in the manner they had intended.

Advertisement

""Public reaction was favorable to the news that a glass of wine a day can help prevent heart attacks,"" Peavy said. ""Of course, most people figured that eight glasses of wine a day must be better than one. And many Americans reacted well to the news that eggs probably wouldn't kill them outright. Aside from that, they've pretty much ignored every word we've ever said concerning just about everything.""

Because the experts' advice was barely followed, the mass resignation is expected to have little impact on the lives of most Americans.

Advertisement

""Go ahead, America,"" Peavy said. ""You don't need us. Watch all the topsoil go down the Mississippi. Transport your children in baskets on top of your SUV deathmobiles. Keep playing with your cute and cuddly pal, the atom. Press your nose against the TV screen for even more educational 3rd Rock From The Sun enjoyment. Use plentiful gasoline to burn book- readers at the stake. Don't eat anything but sugared pork lard. Do whatever you want.""

Despite its negligible impact on the population at large, the sudden dearth of experts is expected to be devastating for the American media, particularly TV newsmagazines, which have come to heavily rely on experts for their incisive, time-filling punditry.

""How in the world are we supposed to do a story on how the Internet is changing the face of Christianity without Internet and Christianity experts?"" said Dateline NBC executive producer Russell Ross. ""How can we report on the stress-relieving impact of whale songs without top psychotherapists and marine biologists to offer their perspective? Without the insight of professors and best-selling authors, a TV special report has no credibility. It may well mean the end of American telejournalism as we know it.""

According to FDA spokesperson Jonathan Landau, the exiting advisors will be missed, but the nation must move forward.

Advertisement

""We, of course, are deeply saddened to lose America's most knowledgeable individuals in every field,"" Landau said. ""But at the same time, it's important to recognize that their advice, however well-informed or well-intentioned, was almost always impractical.""

Landau said he plans to fill his own vacant advisory positions with ""positive-minded, people-friendly sexperts, advice columnists and astrologers"" as soon as funding can be arranged.",718,4607,4,24

You wouldn’t be able to see what those mysterious beings from an alternate universe were doing to your penis, but that would of course be part of the thrill.” The theoretical astro-fetishists confirmed they had recently applied for a grant that would allow them to test their hypothesis by launching perverts into a black hole penis-first.

Now, residents of Paris can enjoy all 81 stories of the Tower, including ground-floor coffee shops, full amenities like a gym and pool for residents, and, of course—for one lucky person—an amazing four-square-foot penthouse suite with breathtaking views of Paris at the top.” At press time, Bisset also added that a parking lot for the Eiffel Tower would soon be underway, as soon as they demolished the abandoned Arc de Triomphe.",188,1198,4,30

1,Black Guy Asks Nation For Change,https://politics.theonion.com/black-guy-asks-nation-for-change-1819569703,"CHICAGO—According to witnesses, a loud black man approached a crowd of some 4,000 strangers in downtown Chicago Tuesday and made repeated demands for change.

""The time for change is now,"" said the black guy, yelling at everyone within earshot for 20 straight minutes, practically begging America for change. ""The need for change is stronger and more urgent than ever before. And only you—the people standing here today, and indeed all the people of this great nation—only you can deliver this change.""

Advertisement

The black guy is oddly comfortable demanding change from people he's never even met.

It is estimated that, to date, the black man has asked every single person in the United States for change.

""I've already seen this guy four times today,"" Chicago-area ad salesman Blake Gordon said. ""Every time, it's the same exact spiel. 'I need change.' 'I want change.' Why's he so eager for all this change? What's he going to do with it, anyway?""

After his initial requests for change, the black man rambled nonstop on a variety of unrelated topics, calling for affordable health care, demanding that the government immediately begin withdrawing troops from Iraq, and proposing a $75 billion economic stimulus plan to create new jobs.

""What a wacko,"" Schaumburg, IL resident Patrick Morledge said. ""And, of course, after telling us all about how he had the ability to magically fix everything, he went right back to asking for change. Typical.""

""If he's really looking for change, he's got the wrong guy,"" Morledge added.

Reports indicate that the black man has been riding from city to city across the country, asking for change wherever he goes. Citizens in Austin, TX said they spotted the same guy standing on the street Friday, shouting far-fetched ideas about global warming. Cleveland residents also reported seeing him in a local park, wildly gesticulating and quoting from the Bible. And last week, patrons at the Starlight Diner in Cheyenne, WY claimed that the black man accosted them while they were eating, repeatedly requesting change.

Advertisement

""I saw him walk in and I knew he was headed straight for our table,"" said mother of three Gladys Davies. ""He just stood there smiling at us for a while, and asked how our food tasted. Then he went and did the same thing at the next table over. The nerve of some people.""

Those who encountered the black man Tuesday said he engaged in erratic behavior, including pointing at random people in the crowd and desperately saying he needs their help, going up to complete strangers and hugging them, and angrily claiming that he is not looking for just a little bit of change, but rather a great deal of change, and that he wants it ""right now.""

Advertisement

""I'll be honest, when that black guy said he would 'stop at nothing' to get change, it kind of scared me,"" local mechanic Phil Nighbert said. ""Just leave me alone.""

Though many were taken aback by the black man's brazen demands, some, such as Jackson, MS's Holly Moser, sympathized with him. She gave the black man credit for boldly standing up and asking every last person around him for change.

Advertisement

""I told him I'd give him some if I saw him later, even though I probably won't,"" Moser said. ""Very nice man, though.""

Most, however, ignored his requests.

""I'm a hardworking American who pays his taxes, and the last thing I need is some guy on the street demanding change from me,"" said William Overkamp, a Springfield, IL gun-shop owner.

He added, ""What he really needs is a job.""",599,3551,6,32
1,A classic look at gentrification,https://local.theonion.com/sometimes-i-feel-like-im-the-only-one-trying-to-gentrif-1819584310,"Eli Kearney



When I moved into this neighborhood, I fell in love right away. Not with the actual neighborhood, but with its potential: It's affordable, there are nice row houses all around just waiting to be filled up by my friends, there's lot of open space to be exploited, and plenty of parking. Plus, this area has got a great authentic feel and, with a little work, it could be even more authentic. Perfect, right?

Advertisement

So why am I the only one doing anything about it?

I am always telling my other struggling artist, freelance graphic designer, and independent T-shirt-maker friends that this is the neighborhood to take it to. It's the next big thing. Sure, it's an hour from my day job and right next to a stinky canal and a power station, but that's the whole charm—it keeps the yuppies out.

It's frustrating, though. My friends insist they're happy where they are. But if they only saw the idealized neighborhood I see, where that rundown old health clinic is turned into a tattoo parlor, and that Last Supper mural is replaced with one featuring Radiohead or a stylized corporate octopus, they'd come around.

The problem is that the property owners here are clueless. They fill their yards with pavement and statues of the Virgin Mary, when all they have to do is clear that brush and we'd have a great beer garden or bocce court. They're spending all this money to renovate the old church, when it'd be put to better use split it up into condos. My landlord has no idea this apartment—hell, every apartment in this building—is undervalued. He could quadruple his profits by cutting my place in half. So I give him an extra 20 bucks a month hoping he gets the hint, but he just takes it out of the next month's rent.

Do any of these people appreciate what the neighborhood they're living in could be?

I'm trying to convince the owners of that taqueria on the corner to change their décor to incorporate some more of that funky Day Of The Dead motif I really like. But they insist on bland white walls. Ugh! I can barely pronounce the name, let alone enjoy its delicious, reasonably priced meals. Plus, you could take all the cool stuff from the five thrift stores and make one really great vintage shop. They'd make a fortune! And, you know, we would all have a fantastic view of downtown if only they'd tear down that dilapidated garage by the waterfront. Or, better yet, they could turn it into a restaurant with a roof deck. Can you say ""brunch on the harbor""?

Advertisement

I can't be the only one who'd like to see a community garden and dog run around here, can I?

It sure would help attract people like me if there was a record store, too, and not the one with the giant Shakira cutout in the window. I mean a decent one. I went in to see if they had the new Fiery Furnaces, and they had never heard of it. They said they'd see if they could order it for me, but I declined. I mean, what's the point of supporting a local business if it's not cool?

Advertisement

It feels like I'm the only one trying to do any good around here.

When I first moved in, I loved the 50-cent coffees—it was like living in the '80s—but I wish they'd listen to me and start making lattes. I know I'd pay the extra three bucks, and I'm sure everyone else around here would, too.

Advertisement

I've tried being proactive. But none of the locals I've talked to about bringing in a co-op health-food grocery store have seemed excited at all. Nor have I gotten any of them to take part in my community open-house idea for hip young people to come see what this neighborhood is capable of. What did they do instead? They had a barbecue. With very loud music.

I mean, I don't want the people here to leave. I just want them to stay inside more. Especially if they're not going to do anything to bring this community to life. But they're always out on their stoops, just playing dominoes or talking. I like talking, but I do it inside, where it was meant to be done. It makes me uncomfortable to have people watching me all the time. Not that I think they'd do anything, but I just like to be a little more private.

Advertisement

Also, their dogs stay outside and bark all day. I like dogs just fine, but why can't their dogs be smaller and more nervous?

It's getting to the point where I feel like I'm tilting at windmills. But I can't give up—I know this neighborhood would benefit from the diversity of more people like me moving in. If you need a good place to live, come check out my 'hood. It's quirky, but it could use a few more creative types to get it jumping. But no developers—those guys just ruin it for the rest of us.",856,4650,5,32
1,Deformed Freak Born Without Penis,https://www.theonion.com/deformed-freak-born-without-penis-1819575921,"The utterly disfigured creature, who sources say somehow has to make its way through life with no male genitalia whatsoever.

NORFOLK, VA—In an alarming case that has baffled and repulsed many, sources confirmed Tuesday that a severely deformed freak born without a penis has managed to live with the condition for over 26 years.

Advertisement

The bizarre, monstrous human specimen was reportedly born with no other noticeable maladies and has, amazingly enough, attempted to lead a normal, albeit severely impaired life despite possessing no male genitalia whatsoever.

“We first noticed something was off about three months into the pregnancy, and I was of course horrified,” said Dr. Mark Joules, the obstetrician who delivered the grotesque—some would say subhuman—abhorrence of nature. “You could clearly see in the ultrasound that a penis and testicles were not developing as one would hope—or at all, in fact—and we immediately knew something was terribly, terribly wrong.”

“Had we caught it earlier, we most likely would have recommended that the pregnancy be terminated,” Joules continued. “But it was unfortunately too late at that point, so we were forced to deliver the baby as planned and just pray that it could get by in that state. We did our best, but with such a horrible and incredibly crippling deformity, there wasn’t much hope to be had.”

According to reports, the sadly disfigured 26-year-old’s quality of life has been greatly diminished due to such a condition. Sources said the abnormal, visibly blemished creature has been repeatedly passed over for employment opportunities, frequently gawked at and harassed on the street by total strangers, and has faced near constant discrimination for over two decades, all due to the horrific and debilitating birth defect.

Indeed, many are reportedly unable to look past the glaring deformity and simply see the 26-year-old as a human being.

“Whoa, look at that,” said 31-year-old onlooker Grant Megson, who, like many others, gawked at the freakish human anomaly while passing by on the sidewalk. “I don’t mean to stare, but honestly, it’s hard not to. Jesus Christ.”

Advertisement

“I just wish some of my buddies were here to see this,” added Megson, smiling and taking one last look before continuing with his day.

Sources confirmed that, unfortunately, such cases are actually quite common, with roughly one in every two babies afflicted with the lifelong disfigurement.

Advertisement

However, that is reportedly little consolation to the malformed specimen’s father, who told reporters that a day doesn’t go by in which he doesn’t wish his child was born a normal, healthy baby with male genitalia.

“Sadly, because the deformity is so obvious, our child was treated very differently from all the other kids,” the father told reporters, admitting that he was incredibly upset and disappointed when he first learned that his baby would be born a freak, one to be mistreated and viewed as inferior its whole life. “Even though the doctors explained all the incredible challenges and prejudice the poor thing would face, I don’t think it really sunk in until after the birth, when I saw the disfigurement with my own eyes. You never want your child to have to grow up that way.”

“But what can you do?” he added. “I’m just thankful that my other two kids weren’t born like that.”",547,3375,5,33

1,"I'm Like a Chocoholic, But for Booze","http://www.theonion.com/articles/im-like-a-chocoholic-but-for-booze,10739/","Ralph Chadwick



Did you ever know a ""chocoholic""? One of those folks who just can't get enough chocolate? I bet there's at least one in your home or workplace. At my house, it's my wife Emily. She's got to have her little bowl of Hershey's Kisses in the living room. She can't go shopping without bringing home some chocolate ice cream or a chocolate-cake mix. She's even got a funny little sweatshirt that says, ""My Name Is Emily, And I'm A Chocoholic.""

Advertisement

To be honest, I'm a bit of a chocoholic myself. Except for one small detail. You see, instead of being addicted to chocolate, I'm addicted to booze. Yep, from dawn to dusk, there's one thing on my mind: booze! Beer, liquor, wine, all that stuff!

When my wife gets one of her cravings, she reaches for a Baby Ruth or Mars bar. With me, it's Icehouse beer. My refrigerator is always stocked with plenty of it. I also have a little flask of whiskey in my desk drawer at work. In fact, if you can keep a secret, I even keep some booze in my car in case of traffic jams. I just can't stand to be without booze for too long!

I'm a lot like that Cookie Monster on Sesame Street. Only it's more like the Booze Monster. When I walk into a party and see that they have booze of any kind, it's like, ""Whoa-hoa! All bets are off! Lemme at that booze!""

I remember this one time, there was no chocolate in the house. Emily was going out of her mind, trying to scrape up some sort of chocolate fix. In the end, she resorted to drinking a cup of hot cocoa. It was so cute! Sort of like the time I drank all her hairspray because there was no booze in the house. Or that other time with the rubbing alcohol. Or the Nyquil. Or the Aqua-Velva.

Another time, I was completely out of booze, and all the stores and bars were closed, so I drove 45 minutes to find a place that would sell me some beer or something. I was kind of embarrassed, because here it was late Monday night, and I had to work the next day, and I'm driving around looking for booze. But, hey, that's just how things are when you're a ""booze-oholic"" like me! I finally found a huge all-night liquor store. You should have seen how I loaded up! Cases of this, fifths of that. It was 5 a.m. when I finally got home, so I just said, ""To heck with work!"" and had my own little improvised holiday. I called it Booze Day! I'd been working hard, getting to work on time almost every day for two weeks, so I figured I'd earned what wound up being the rest of the week off.

Sometimes Emily and I think we should cut down a little–you know, health concerns and all. But there's always some special occasion that gives us an excuse to go off our ""diets."" Halloween was Emily's last big bender. We only got three trick-or-treaters the entire night, so the whole big bowl of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups went straight to her. (Or straight to her thighs, as she said!)

Advertisement

My most recent bender was today. There was a good movie on TV, and I figured, hey, I'll need steady hands to change the volume. Of course, it all went straight to my liver, but what are you gonna do?

For my birthday, Emily gave me the funniest coffee mug, perfect for Irish coffee. It has a little teddy bear on it with a ""don't mess with me"" look on his face, and it says, ""Hand Over The Booze And Nobody Gets Hurt."" I laughed so hard! That bear was just like me when I robbed the party store earlier this year! Also, the mug is really big, so it can hold a lot of booze… another plus!

Yes, those chocoholics are a funny sort. But they won't hurt you–as long as they have their chocolate, that is. Or, in my case, booze!",691,3633,7,36

1,God finally gives a shout-out back...,https://www.theonion.com/god-finally-gives-shout-out-back-to-all-his-niggaz-1819566159,"SOUTH BRONX, NY—The Lord Almighty finally responded to nearly two decades of praise in hip-hop album liner notes Monday, when He gave a shout-out back to all His loyal niggaz.

Rappers Method Man and Redman give big ups to God (inset).

Advertisement

""Right about now, I want to send a shout-out to each and every nigga who's shown Me love through the years,"" said the Lord, His booming voice descending from Heaven. ""I got mad love for each and every one of you niggaz. Y'all real niggaz out there, you know who you are. Y'all was there for me, and it's about time I'm-a give some love back to God's true crew.""

""All y'all niggaz, y'all be My niggaz,"" the Lord added.

As of press time, God has thanked nearly 7,000 of His niggaz, including those in New York's Bad Boy and Ruff Ryders posses, the No Limit soldiers and Cash Money Millionaires holdin' it down in New Orleans, Nelly and the whole St. Lunatics crew, Busta and the rest of the Flipmode Squad, His peeps from back in the day, and all the real ruffneck niggaz in lockdown. He also sent shout-outs to everybody in the Old School, as well as to Lil' Bow Wow and all the other new niggaz just coming up.

Advertisement

""Mad props to P. Diddy, Jay-Z, DMX, Lil' Kim, Mystikal, Eve, Ja Rule, Jadakiss, Trick Daddy, and Xzibit. And one love to Meth, RZA, GZA, Ghostface, and the rest of My real niggaz in the Wu-Tang Clan,"" the deity said. ""These My beloved niggaz, with whom I be well-pleased.""

Now nearing the 48-hour mark, the Lord's first-ever reciprocal shout-out shows little sign of slowing down. Based on estimates of the number of rappers who have thanked Him in liner notes over the past 20 years, hip-hop experts say the historic shout-out is likely to continue through early next week.

A pair of shout-out tablets handed down by the Lord.

In addition to rap's current stars, God offered shout-outs to the original hip-hop heads, including such pioneers of the art form as Grandmaster Flash, Busy Bee, Melle Mel, Jazzy Jay, Kool Moe Dee, Afrika Bambaataa, DJ Red Alert, the Cold Crush Brothers, Fab 5 Freddy, Kurtis Blow, Kool Herc, and the Funky 4+1.

Advertisement

God also offered shout-outs to the many DJs, record labels, magazines, TV shows, and radio stations that have tirelessly supported hip-hop over the years. Among them are Def Jam, Tommy Boy, Jive, Roc-A-Fella, Rap Pages, The Source, Right On!, The Box, Funkmaster Flex, Ed Lover and Dr. Dre, WBLS 107.5, KISS-FM, and Hot 97.

""For supporting the many artists who have supported Me so faithfully, I say thank you,"" God said. ""All praise to Devante Harrell, Wanda Simmons, LaShell Thomas, and everybody else at Uptown/MCA for making this possible.""

Advertisement

As a further sign of His love for the hip-hop community, God assured the nation's rappers that He is taking good care of all their peers currently with Him in heaven.

""Tupac, Notorious B.I.G., Eazy-E, Scott LaRock—some of y'all niggaz are already up in this bitch,"" the Lord said. ""For those of you who were left behind, know that the Lord has got your dead homies' backs. Faith [Evans], I promise I'm taking real good care of your Biggie. He resting in crazy peace, no doubt.""

Advertisement

Thus far, God has not played favorites, thanking such fallen-off acts as Hammer and Vanilla Ice in the same breath as vital artists whose careers are still going strong. The Lord has also seen fit to thank the little-known likes of Baby Tragic, DJ Phreek Malik, and Da Ill Collector—MCs so obscure that virtually no one within the hip-hop community has heard of them. All rappers, God explained, are equal in His sight, and none are too small to escape His notice.

""God sees even the smallest sparrow fall,"" said Dr. Cornel West, Harvard University professor of African-American studies and philosophy of religion. ""The same is true of MCs: Whether a major superstar or a complete unknown, all rappers are His children, and He loves them all.""

Advertisement

The sheer volume of names notwithstanding, the nation's rappers are deeply touched by God's gesture of tribute and appreciation, with many stating that they ""feelin' Him.""

""God is the Original,"" Brooklyn-based rapper Mos Def said. ""The world is ruled by the wealthy and the wicked, but all respect due to the Creator who made this world and who will one day bring justice to the wicked and righteous alike.""

Advertisement

Despite the overwhelmingly positive response among rappers, the Lord is drawing fire in certain circles for His use of the word ""nigga."" On Monday's Larry King Live, conservative activist Rev. Calvin Butts, a longtime ally of the Lord, blasted Him for His ""shocking, unexpected use of the racially loaded N-word."" Some concerned parties, including decency crusader C. Delores Tucker, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), and members of the San Francisco-based What About The Children? Foundation, are calling for a boycott of church services until God issues an apology.

Reacting to the controversy, many in the hip-hop community are rushing to the Lord's defense.

Advertisement

""The word 'nigga' means different things depending on how it's used and who's saying it,"" rap legend and Public Enemy frontman Chuck D said. ""Judging from context, God obviously wasn't being derogatory. He was using 'nigga' as a blanket term of affection for all His true supporters on the rap scene. At one point, He said, 'I wanna give a shout-out to Ad-Rock, MC Serch, and my man Dan The Automator—all y'all is real niggaz in My all-benevolent sight.' Considering the fact that Ad-Rock and Serch are Jewish, and the Automator is Asian-American, it's clear God isn't talking about race here. He's just paying respect to all those who have paid respect to Him.""

""God's the ultimate playa, so naturally He's going to have some haters,"" rapper Ice Cube said. ""But these haters need to realize that if you mess with the man upstairs, you will get your ass smote. True dat.""",1009,5925,6,37

1,Grad Student Deconstructs Take-Out Menu,https://www.theonion.com/grad-student-deconstructs-take-out-menu-1819566497,"CAMBRIDGE, MA—Jon Rosenblatt, 27, a Harvard University English graduate student specializing in modern and postmodern critical theory, deconstructed the take-out menu of a local Mexican restaurant ""out of sheer force of habit"" Monday.

Jon Rosenblatt with the menu in question.

""What's wrong with me?"" Rosenblatt asked fellow graduate student Amanda Kiefer following the incident. ""Am I completely losing my mind? I just wanted to order some food from Burrito Bandito. Next thing I know, I'm analyzing the menu's content as a text, or 'text,' subjecting it to a rigorous critical reevaluation informed by Derrida, De Man, etc., as a construct, or 'construct,' made up of multi-varied and, in fact, often self-contradictory messages, or 'meanings,' derived from the cultural signifiers evoked by the menu, or 'menu,' and the resultant assumptions within not only the mind of the menu's 'authors' and 'readers,' but also within the larger context of our current postmodern media environment. Man, I've got to finish my dissertation before I end up in a rubber room.""

At approximately 2 a.m., Rosenblatt was finishing a particularly difficult course-pack reading on the impact of feminism, post-feminism, and current 'queer' theory on received notions of gender and sexual preference/identity. Realizing he hadn't eaten since lunch, the Ph.D candidate picked up the Burrito Bandito menu. Before he could decide on an order, he instinctively reduced the flyer to a set of shifting, mutable interpretations informed by the set of ideological biases—cultural, racial, economic, and political—that infect all ethnographic and commercial ""histories.""

""Seeing this long list of traditional Mexican foods—burritos, tacos, tamales—with a price attached to each caused me to reflect on the means by which capitalist society consumes and subsumes ethnicity, turning tradition into mass-marketable 'product' bleached of its original 'authentic' identity,"" Rosenblatt said. ""And yet, it is still marketed and sold by the dominant power structure in society as 'authentic' experience, informed by racist myths and projections of 'otherness' onto the blank canvas of the alien culture.""

Added Rosenblatt: ""Then, of course, I realized that this statement was problematically narrow, since I was assigning an inherent 'actual' meaning to the Ethnicity Content of the take-out menu. Which was, in itself, contradictory to one of the primary theses of deconstruction, i.e., that it's impossible for an 'impartially' observing arbiter to establish any ultimate or secure meaning in a text. I'd just begun to make a mental note of the cartoon anthropomorphic burrito on the front of the menu as a signifier of such arbitrary 'otherness' when I yelled, 'What the hell am I doing?'""

Rosenblatt's inadvertent outburst nearly led to an altercation.

Rosenblatt's analysis of the Burrito Bandito menu.

""I totally woke up my neighbor in the room across the hall,"" Rosenblatt said. ""He looked like he might hit me, so I tried reasoning with him, but it came out all wrong. Instead, I found myself saying that the multiplicities and contingencies of human experience necessarily pose a threat to the tendency of any arbitrary power or 'authority' to dictate oppressive hierarchical social structures or centralize power. Ergo, any attempt to establish hierarchies and centralized power according to arbitrary dichotomies of 'right' and 'wrong' behaviors was therefore not only morally and philosophically, but also politically problematic, and, in fact, oppressive. Man, did that ever not work.""

According to friends, Rosenblatt has been under a great deal of stress in recent months due to the financial strain of student-loan debts, his part-time tutoring job, and a heavy academic courseload.

Advertisement

""Lacking proper sleep and struggling to keep up in the intensely competitive crucible that is Harvard grad school, Jon is starting to lose it,"" said roommate Rob Carroll, 26. ""He has become so steeped in the complex jargon of critical theory that he's unable to resist the urge to deconstruct even the most mundane things.""

This is not his first time Rosenblatt has deconstructed a random item out of habit.

""The other day, we passed a bus stop with a poster for Disney's The Country Bears,"" said friend Karen Pilson, 26. ""I heard him mumble something about the incorporation of previously received notions concerning wildlife and our ecological environment into a reassuring, behavior-validating consumer commodity in the form of aggressively infantilized computer-animated pseudohumans that talk and play country music. Before I even had a chance to react, he went off the deep end and started throwing out terms like 'prenotional,' 'prolegomena,' 'gynocritical,' and 'logocentrism.' I was just stunned.""

Added Pilson: ""I told him he was worrying me and recommended a good psychiatrist. Bad move, because that prompted him to launch into a whole discussion of Foucault's 'Male Gaze' as it applies to mother/child pair-bonding in Lacanian psychoanalysis.""

Advertisement

In spite of his friends' concern, Rosenblatt seems unable to restrain his reflexive impulse to deconstruct.

""I can't help it,"" Rosenblatt said. ""Even when I close my eyes at night, I feel myself deconstructing things in my dreams—random stuff like that two-hour Dukes Of Hazzard reunion special or the Andy Warhol postage stamp or commercials for that new squeezable gel deodorant. I'd say I'm going crazy, but that presupposes an artificial barrier between societally preexisting concepts of 'sanity' and 'insanity' which themselves represent another false dichotomy maintained for the preservation of certain entrenched elements of the status quo and… Oh, God. I'm doing it again.""

Rosenblatt is considering taking a leave of absence from his graduate studies to spend several months living in his mother's basement in Elmira, NY.

Asked for comment, Professor Derek Nystrom of Skidmore College, an expert on deconstructivist thought, said that the Burrito Bandito take-out menu is open to many interpretations.

Advertisement

""The menu can be viewed an infinite number of ways, depending on viewer perspective,"" Nystrom said. ""None of these differing views would be any more or less 'correct.' However, the menu's Pancho Villa-style burrito caricature, complete with bandoliers, six-guns, gaucho moustache, and sombrero, would be considered problematic by most scholars.""

Added Nystrom: ""To paraphrase: 'What is a take-out menu not, anyway? Everything, of course. What is a take-out menu? Nothing, of course.'""",1006,6641,5,39

1,Homoerotic Overtones Enliven NRA Meeting,https://local.theonion.com/homoerotic-overtones-enliven-nra-meeting-1819564201,"COEUR D'ALENE, ID—Repression was the order of the day as the National Rifle Association's North Idaho Chapter held its annual convention this weekend.

NRA member Jack Harwich admires a fellow member's piece, stirring potent new feelings within himself.

Advertisement

More than 25,000 dedicated gun lovers from across Northern Idaho flocked to the Coeur d'Alene Convention Center for the two-day event, happily sublimating homosexual impulses amid a carefully maintained facade of platonic camaraderie.

Moscow, ID, resident Richard Hoflinger, 47, a longtime gun-rights activist, exhibited the collection of antique rifles through which he has channeled his culturally unacceptable impulses. ""Guns should be part of any upstanding Christian family,"" Hoflinger said, sticking a long, thick, oily pipe-cleaner 14 inches up an 1886 Remington.

In the next booth, another latent gay man, Duane Erlich, moved his hand slowly up and down a well-polished 1948 Winchester. ""Ain't she a beautiful baby?"" he said, displaying the kind of feminization/infantilization of firearms for which NRA members are renowned.

Erlich then demonstrated the proper loading procedure for his ""baby,"" lovingly inserting a pair of bullets into the dark, snug-fitting tunnels before thrusting the gun's bolt smoothly into the action, cocking it firmly. ""This'll blow a man straight to heaven,"" he said.

The tone of the event was set by chapter president John Henry Unger, whose opening remarks cited the ""wonderful variety of weaponry on display, from little snub-nosed pieces that fit snugly in your pocket to big, meaty shooters with barrels as thick as your arm.""

Unger then fired his father's prize Colt Peacemaker revolver into the air, drawing raucous applause from the crowd, many of whose own fathers had suppressed latent physical attraction for their adolescent sons by channeling forbidden feelings into totemistic firearms.

All over the convention floor, gun manufacturers proudly unveiled new technologies which will allow simmering homoerotic tensions to be expressed with greater nuance than ever before. At the Smith & Wesson booth, company spokesman Darrell Trace displayed a handgun made from a newly developed metal alloy whose ""incredibly hard"" nature, he explained, gives it no recoil after use, providing its user with ""a far greater sense of control over his piece.""

""It's a very comfortable gun, very soft in the hands,"" Trace added, noting that Smith & Wesson had designed the gun to appeal to ""shooters tired of coming home from the firing range with sore, worn-out wrists.""

But even as conventioneers reveled in a two-day orgy of firearm-to-phallus transference, a dark cloud hung over the event. The NRA has declined in power over the last decade, and its once-potent lobbyists have come out on the small end of key legislative battles like the Brady Bill, causing many members to bring their lifelong subconscious fears of castration to the fore.

""If the gun-control lobby wants my rod, they'll have to yank it from my dead body,"" said Pocatello-area bar-owner Joseph Greer, holding a tell-tale snub-nosed revolver.

""Those guys up there in Washington are tryin' to take our guns away, but we ain't gonna let 'em,"" Greer continued, adding classic paternal displacement to the already rich psychosexual tapestry. ""No siree, Bob.""",520,3382,5,40
1,Supreme Court Overturns 'Right v. Wrong',https://www.theonion.com/supreme-court-overturns-right-v-wrong-1819573211,"Justice Scalia said of the decision, ""As long as I am on the bench, I will always fight for what is wrong.""

WASHINGTON—Striking down the judicial precedent that established the legal supremacy of right over wrong more than two centuries ago, the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday overturned Right v. Wrong.

Advertisement

The landmark reversal—a bitterly contested 5-4 decision that has been widely praised by murderers, rapists, bigots, usurers, and pro-wrong advocates nationwide—nullifies all previously lawful forms of right and makes it very difficult for Americans to make ethical decisions or be generally decent human beings without facing criminal charges.

""It is the opinion of this court that the Constitution was crafted in such a manner as to uphold and encourage practices that are not right and, ideally, are very wrong,"" Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the majority, which also in­cluded Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Anthony Kennedy, and John Roberts. ""Despite the compelling case for goodness, truth, and justice made by our predecessors in the case of Right v. Wrong, we firmly believe that malice, dishonesty, and injustice were the framers' original intent.""

""The ruling today rights an age-old wrong in which right has consistently, and unconstitutionally, prevailed,"" Justice Alito wrote in a concurring opinion, adding that the decision between right and wrong did not present a difficult choice for him. ""It is clear the earlier court erred when issuing the Right decision.""

The ruling in Right v. Wrong was handed down in 1790 by the Supreme Court's six original members, all of whom sided with the plaintiff, prompting Chief Justice John Jay to write, ""It is the emphatic province and duty of this highest judicial tribunal to rule in favor of Right, as the argument in support of Right is the right one, and the argument in support of Wrong is the wrong one.""

Since that time, the verdict has been cited in most legal rulings at the state and federal level, and has been upheld by the Supreme Court numerous times, most notably in a 1974 opinion overturning a Six Circuit Court of Appeals decision that would have re-segregated the nation's schools, abolished the minimum wage, legalized evil, and allowed law enforcement officials to conduct searches and seizures without a warrant.

This term, the high court agreed to hear the appeal of an Arizona state judge's ruling for the defendant in the case of Good v. Bad, a decision that had once more called into question the basic tenets of Right v. Wrong.

Advertisement

""If you look at the current makeup of the court, the verdict is hardly surprising,"" said law professor Erwin Chemerinsky, adding that given recent decisions to permit unlimited corporate spending in electoral politics, crack down on civil liberties, and allow the execution of Troy Davis to proceed, he believed the justices had been angling to do away with Right for some time. ""It's long been clear Roberts and Alito were in the camp favoring wrong, and Scalia's passionate criticism of the Right decision almost certainly swayed Justice Kennedy.""

""As for Justice Thomas, he was practically asleep when the attorneys representing Good gave their oral arguments,"" Chemerinsky added. ""In terms of his job, that was definitely the wrong thing to do, so he made it pretty clear which side he was on.""

Advertisement

Many constitutional scholars have argued the ruling sets a dangerous precedent whereby violent criminals could conceivably appeal their convictions and, citing the federal judiciary's rejection of Right, be acquitted of their crimes.

According to reports, the impact of the verdict has already been felt, with a Massachusetts man murdering three people this morning in front of several Boston police officers who by law could do nothing but watch. In addition, a woman who volunteered at a Toledo, OH soup kitchen has been arrested, sentenced to six months in jail, and fined $25,000.

Advertisement

""This ruling is so broad that even those who show an intent to do right can be prosecuted,"" said Martha Minow, dean of Harvard Law School. ""Make no mistake, the court is sending a message to pro-right supporters that fairness and equality are no longer the laws of the land. And the decision has no chance of being overturned in the immediate future, because the bench will be dominated by pro-wrong advocates for years to come.""

Justice Stephen Breyer chose to read his dissenting opinion aloud before the court, a rare gesture apparently aimed at expressing the full measure of his disgust with the verdict.

""The court needs to overturn this ruling immediately because, simply put, it's the right thing to do,"" said the associate justice, who, along with his colleagues joining him in the minority, was then arrested by Capitol Police, placed into custody, and is currently awaiting trial.",793,4890,6,40

Coke Whore

I'll bet a day doesn't go by that I don't hear something negative about crack cocaine, and the people who love it. Well, it just so happens that, despite all the mudslinging you may have read in the magazines, there are plenty of decent, hardworking crack lovers, just like in any other ""walk of life.""

Advertisement

Just because someone is desperately addicted to an incredibly intense form of refined cocaine doesn't mean they've forgotten about those old-fashioned values like thrift, cooperation and helping each other out. People always describe crack houses as someplace they wouldn't want to be. Well, the truth of the matter is that I wouldn't want to live anywhere where the people aren't working together. And that was exactly the key to turning our crack house into a crack home!

Just like a good drug needs to be cut in just the right proportions, an honest-to-goodness crack home needs the right mix of people, each with their own special qualities, but who are willing to be ""team players"" to achieve their shared goal of constantly staying high on a really expensive drug. Crack doesn't grow on trees, you know!

A home needs whores, shakedown boys, thieves, muggers, scam artists—a whole range of diverse people with unique attributes. Cooperation: That's the difference between a bunch of shivering people hitting the pipe in the same abandoned building, and a real family sharing a home.

We have a chart on the refrigerator to remind everyone of their duties, and we rotate the chores on a regular basis to make it fair. No one likes to get fucked in the ass by strangers every day for a week straight, do they? No, so we switch the chores so that today it's prostitution, but tomorrow it might be liquor-store hold-ups or muggings. I add colorful stickers and glitter to our duty chart, but you can personalize yours anyway you want, maybe by cutting pictures out of old magazines or using bright fuzzy yarn to string up the amputated fingers of suppliers who have passed you bad rock.

We're one big family in our crack home because we recognize the uniqueness of each and every individual addict. (Not everyone is good at everything, but everyone is good at something!) We keep the lines of communication open and remember to listen so everyone has a friend to turn to. Sure, we may poke fun when the maggots covering the piles of garbage find their way into the gaping sores all over Eddie's body that never seem to heal—but we'd never kick him out of the room just because we don't want to look at him.

Maybe someday our crack home will even have a till jar for bus rides to the free clinic. Then, hopefully, Yolanda will never again have to throw herself off the fire escape and crawl back upstairs to have a miscarriage on the kitchen floor.

Another big part of turning a crack house into a crack home is respect for everyone. Dr. Maxwell McFarland, author of Wake up and Live, reminds us that everything alive on this earth is dependent on something else. No one is a loner! I need you and you need me! If the pick-up doesn't come through and I start shaking so bad that I vomit, and someone else needs to vomit too, I'll share the cardboard box. If DeeDee has gone catatonic and hasn't shut her eyes since yesterday, none of us knock her over just for fun.

And if anyone should overdose or get shot or even just suddenly find a torrent of blood streaming from their nostrils and then choke to death on mouthfuls of black-red mucus, we all help carry the body over into the neighbor's yard. Like I said, it's about mutual respect. And if the body lays in the yard too long and stuff starts to eat it, we'll throw something over it.

Advertisement

I've been told it takes a whole village to raise a child and I believe it, so if Lisa's baby works her way free, I'll do my part to make sure she doesn't crawl out the window again.

Last but not least, there's no squabbling and rowing allowed in a good home. I even made a big sign that said ""Words can hurt… Think before you speak!"" and I hung it where everyone would see it—right over the big metal trash can that everyone defecates into now that the broken toilet fell through the urine-soaked floor. Almost everyone abides by the no-fighting rule, but if a conflict comes up, we have a house meeting and every one of us gets a vote. (Everyone, great or small, counts!) Then whoever is on ""Judge"" duty on the chore chart takes the person deemed at fault, and kills that person.

Advertisement

Sure, not all of us are as good at certain tasks as another person might be, but that doesn't matter, as long as everyone tries their best. Remember, the only way to be a winner is to first be a beginner! When you're trying to win one for the home team, 100 percent participation from every member is key. Anything less and Custard will shoot your arms off at the shoulder at close range.

The things I've told you about are all common sense. I was a Home Economics teacher for 31 years before I got hooked on crack and sold my Taurus station wagon, converting the cash into bags of pure snow. But I don't have any tricks up my sleeve, just a wish to see everyone reach their potential!

Surprisingly, when I moved into our little windowless abode, the homies were somewhat reluctant to make any changes at first. But after I knitted everyone a sweater—to combat the shakes—and got Custard on my side by becoming his bitch, everyone else followed right along.

1,Existentialist Firefighter Delays 3 Deaths,https://local.theonion.com/existentialist-firefighter-delays-3-deaths-1819571551,"Farber deferred praise, saying that by charging into danger to rescue the victims he ""merely put off the fate that befalls us all.""

SCHAUMBURG, IL—In an ultimately futile act some have described as courageous and others have called a mere postponing of the inevitable, existentialist firefighter James Farber delayed three deaths Monday.

Advertisement

""I'm no hero,"" Farber said after rescuing the family from a house fire on the 2500 block of West Thacker Street, and prolonging for the time being their slow march toward oblivion. ""Like any other man, I am thrown into this world, alone and terrified, to play a meaningless role in an empty life. In my case, that role happens to involve charging through towering blazes to pull helpless individuals from a sea of flames before they suffocate or are burnt alive.""

Added Farber, ""That hardly makes me a paragon of virtue.""

At 2:30 a.m. Monday, the alarm sounded at Farber's station house, causing the despondent firefighter to emerge from a deep malaise and, though still absorbed by the sense of dread that has preoccupied him since youth, respond promptly to the request for assistance at the home of Stanley and Joyce Morgenstern.

According to department officials, Farber, a 13-year veteran of Ladder Company 8, climbed through a kitchen window and, despite carrying with him a heavy burden of alienation, managed to see all three members of the family to safety.

""He came out the front door with a body slung over each shoulder, and seconds later there was this big fireball and beams started falling and the whole thing caved in,"" neighbor Judy Neal said. ""When it was all over, he just sort of stood there emotionless and silent, as if nothing had happened at all.""

""I think I even saw him shrug,"" she added.

While acknowledging that the Morgenstern family no longer has a home, authorities said it really makes no sense to bemoan this fact, as things like this happen every day, and it's no use trying to pretend that, in and of itself, existence is anything but a provisional circumstance over which we exert limited control.

Advertisement

Though the cause of the fire remains unknown, and can perhaps never truly be known, sources close to the investigation said that no foul play is suspected, only the haphazard, amoral processes inherent in nature itself.

""The house will be rebuilt, or perhaps it won't,"" Farber said of the destruction. ""Perhaps an entirely new building will be built there, one that's not even a house. Or maybe it will remain a vacant lot, and a tree will grow there, and some day, long after I and everyone I know has died, young children will come here and play in its branches.""

Advertisement

Farber became a firefighter in 1997, although he stresses that he could just as easily have ended up a baker, an attorney, or a parking garage attendant, depending on whether or not circumstances led him to find himself in such a life.

As for the ultimate consequences of his actions Monday, Farber said they will forever remain uncertain.

Advertisement

""The family has thanked me repeatedly, especially for saving the life of their only child, but their gratitude ignores the full, crushing weight of reality,"" said Farber, his brow furrowed. ""The world may have all kinds of torture in store for that kid, misery that could have been avoided if not for me.""

""I tried to explain to them that what I did was really nothing more than an expression of despair, and thus absurd, but they just kept saying 'thank you, oh my God, thank you, thank you so much,'"" Farber continued.

Advertisement

With local residents applauding the rescue as an inspiring act of bravery, Farber acknowledged to reporters that entering a burning building and knowing you may never come out is indeed a scary thing. But, he argued, it takes far more courage to face down the fear that comes each day from the horrifying and inescapable knowledge that, at any given moment, a man has the complete freedom to simply pour gasoline all over himself, strike a match, and let himself burn.

When asked if he felt something, anything, after briefly extending the lives of three human beings, Farber replied in the negative.

""I was doing what, at that moment, I was doing,"" he said. ""Tomorrow, if there is another fire, I will do the same. Perhaps in that fire, I will be the one who is killed. Or, on the other hand, perhaps I will not. Either way, there will be anguish and sorrow at some unknown point.""

Divorced since 2001, Scanlon met the 29-year-old Loftus through mutual acquaintance Barbara O'Neill. Thinking the two might make a good match–despite not knowing much about Scanlon personally–O'Neill set the pair up on a blind date.

The date was, according to Loftus, one of her worst ever. Sources say the blame lay in Scanlon's ill-advised decision to put pretense aside, revealing his true identity and destroying any chance he might have had with Loftus.

""I'm glad he felt comfortable being himself,"" said brother Chris Scanlon, 39. ""But when you're in full-blown mid-30s-crisis mode with misogynist tendencies and a desperate, neurotic need for approval, maybe 'the real you' is not the best thing to put forward.""

According to reports, Scanlon's profound insecurity led him to monopolize the first 45 minutes of conversation, talking about nothing but himself. Worse, his inability to get over his divorce prompted him to meticulously detail every phase of his failed marriage.

""It's totally understandable that he's still feeling hurt and emotionally shaky from the breakup,"" Loftus said. ""But that's the sort of thing you should keep buried deep down inside when you're first letting someone get to know you.""

Advertisement

""Sure, in theory, a guy should be able to relax and be himself,"" Loftus continued. ""But when you have such issues about aging that you show up to a date wearing a Billy Joel 'River Of Dreams World Tour' concert T-shirt under your sportjacket, you're putting up a neon sign on your forehead that says, 'Do Not Fuck Me, Ever.' I mean, this guy's a tax lawyer in his 30s. Did he think he was coming across as rockin' or something? Please.""

Loftus added that, while there is nothing inherently wrong with a date mentioning that he attended Yale University, bringing it up every 10 minutes is probably not a good idea.

Advertisement

""Yale this, Yale that,"" Loftus said. ""Any way he could work it into the conversation, he would. It was so obvious that he was clinging to his Ivy League pedigree out of insecurity, as a way of making himself look like an intelligent man of substance. It really just made him look like a dick.""

Scanlon's inability to self-monitor further turned off Loftus when he disclosed ""way, way, way too much"" about his opinions on sex and relationships.

Advertisement

""He must have thought the honest approach would make him look like an open, non-uptight kind of guy,'"" said waitress Susan Sanders, who served the pair during their excruciating two-hour dinner engagement. ""Sexual frankness and maturity are great, but there's such a thing as inappropriate personal revelations. Do you really need to mention on a first date that you're 'totally cool with porn'?""

Those close to Scanlon report that he remains unaware that the date was a disaster, leaving repeated messages on Loftus' voicemail asking when they can ""hook up"" again.

Advertisement

Carlson predicted, however, that Scanlon's insecurity will soon begin to steadily mount with each passing day his calls are not returned, and that, inevitably, he will launch into an exhaustive self-pity session over Loftus' rejection of him.

""I'm sure Marc's next date, whoever she may be, will hear all about it–if he ever gets another date,"" Carlson said. ""If he does, I'm going to suggest he try being nothing remotely like himself.""",690,4156,8,42
1,"Police to Pillage, Terrify Community (1995)",https://www.theonion.com/police-to-pillage-terrify-community-1819563800,"‘Operation Psycho Pig Rampage’ to Begin Tonight

LOS ANGELES (AP)—Citing revenge for what they bill a consistently deteriorating support base and general lack of appreciation, area police are gearing up to get even with the community this evening. Their plan, known as “Operation Psycho Pig Rampage,” calls for the pillaging of homes, harassment of passersby and random shooting of harmless motorists.

Advertisement

Police officers will don riot gear and assault city residents at random, drowning the city in blood.

Officers cited both the O.J. Simpson and Rodney King trials as two incidents that have enormously undermined America’s faith in the police. According to police department insiders across the nation, African-Americans have direct reason to hate the police. In addition, many whites are filled with a once-removed, transitive sense of guilt/em-pathy for the abused black populace.

“The black community has nothing short of a gnawing hatred and mistrust of law enforcement officials,” Deputy police chief Gary Chower said. “And well they should. But that doesn’t mean we are not going to whup major ass this evening, when we roll through the community with the soul-crushing force of a Third World totalitarian autocracy.”

Police department insiders went on to cite years of verbal abuse by citizenry, public portrayals of police as villainous cogs of the system, and repeated lampooning in trucker-themed feature films as further reason for their rage.

“Operation Psycho Pig Rampage will undoubtedly be the average white middle-class liberal’s nightmare,” Officer Harrison Timkin said. “Not only will we subdue citizens with gas and billy clubs, but we hope to terrorize them psychologically as well, using menacing pig-faced tear gas masks to strike fear into their hearts.”

By Saturday the police hope to have needlessly maced, beaten and abused vast sections of the general populace and to have illegally jailed and detained hundreds more.

Psycho Pig organizers plan to use enormous loudspeaker amplification on city street corners to generate oinking and snorting sound effects as they beat citizens into hobbled submission.

Officers are convinced this is both fitting retribution and a necessary step for the populace to understand law enforcement officials’ new role in the American community.

One young police officer, rookie cop Roy Beamer, is looking forward to Psycho Pig Rampage with some reservation.

“I just joined the force and I’m not sure this whole rampage is right,” Beamer said. “But the captain and all the other guys want me to do it, so I guess I’m in support of it.”

Advertisement

Beamer plans to use his riot stick to beat old women until they involuntarily relieve their bowels.

Those in the community have not been supportive of Operation Psycho Pig Rampage, suggesting that it may be in violation of the inherent trust that many citizens have for their public servants.

Advertisement

“I fear for my life and my children’s lives,” area resident Madge Kimterfon said. “Please help us.”

Said resident Maureen Hemterfagh: “My God, they’re going to kill us all.”

Law enforcement officials fear neither reprisals, nor punishment for their actions.

Advertisement

“We are the only members of the community trained and sanctioned by the people to use violence, even deadly force, at our discretion,” Chower said. “Truly, the streets will run red with the blood of the innocent.”

State and federal support for the soon-to-be-ravaged city is unlikely, as many government officials see this as a local issue, best dealt with by local authorities, namely, the police.",571,3647,6,43

That’s right, gamers. Turn off the lights and get ready for terror. Here’s everything we know about Amnesia: Rebirth.

The game takes place in Algeria, which will be conveyed by having an NPC in the first five minutes who refers to the player as “my friend” and never be referenced again.



Players will have to carefully manage their Sanity meter, which depletes from seeing Eddie Van Halen play a blistering, face-melting solo during a performance of “Hot For Teacher.”



The teaser trailer shows the main character looking down at her hands in horror, so at some point you probably touch something really gross on accident.



Advertisement

In addition to jump scares, the developers have promised more subtle horror elements, such as a dish of peeled grapes that they tell you are eyeballs or a bowl of cold spaghetti that stands in for intestines.



Advertisement

Like prior Amnesia games, players will have no means of physically fighting back against the monsters unless they shell out $4.99 for the Plasma Blaster DLC.



Advertisement

Amnesia: Rebirth will feature difficult yet engaging puzzles, like solving the Collatz Conjecture or the Riemann hypothesis.



Advertisement

It’s a direct sequel to Amnesia: The Dark Descent, and a direct prequel to SSX Tricky.

1,Reaganomics Finally Trickles Down To Area Man,https://local.theonion.com/reaganomics-finally-trickles-down-to-area-man-1819569412,"HAZELWOOD, MO—Twenty-six years after Ronald Reagan first set his controversial fiscal policies into motion, the deceased president's massive tax cuts for the ultrarich at last trickled all the way down to deliver their bounty, in the form of a $10 bonus, to Hazelwood, MO car-wash attendant Frank Kellener.

The late President Ronald Reagan clearly had people like present-day car wash attendant Frank Kellener in mind when articulating his ""trickle-down"" economic theory in the early 1980s.

Advertisement

""Back when Reagan was in charge, I didn't think much of him,"" Kellener, 57, said, holding up two five-dollar bills nearly three decades in the making. ""But who would have thought that in 2007 I'd have this extra $10 in my pocket? He may not have lived to see it, but I'm sure President Reagan is up in heaven smiling down on me right now.""

Leading economists say Kellener's unexpected windfall provides the first irrefutable proof of the effectiveness of Reagan's so-called supply-side economics, and shows that the former president had ""incredible, far-reaching foresight.""

""When the tax burden on the upper income brackets is lifted, the rich and not-rich alike all benefit,"" said Arthur Laffer, who was a former member of Reagan's Economic Policy Advisory Board. ""Eventually.""

Frank Kellener

The $10 began its long journey into Kellener's wallet in 1983, when a beefed-up national defense budget of $210 billion enabled the military to purchase advanced warhead-delivery systems from aerospace manufacturer Lockheed. Buoyed by a multimillion-dollar bonus, then-CEO Martin Lawler bought a house on a 5,000-acre plot in Montana. When a forest fire destroyed his home in 1986, Lawler took the federal relief check and invested it in a savings and loan run by a Virginia man named Michael Webber. After Webber's firm collapsed in 1989, and he was indicted on fraud and conspiracy charges, he retained the services of high- powered law firm Rabin & Levy for his defense. After six years and $7 million in legal fees, Webber received only a $250,000 fine, and the defense team went out to celebrate at a Washington, D.C.-area restaurant called Di Forenza. During dinner, lawyer Peter Smith overheard several investment bankers at an adjoining table discussing a hot Internet start-up that was about to go public. Smith took a portion of his earnings from the Webber case and bought several hundred shares in Gadgets.com, quadrupling his investment before selling them four months later. Gadgets.com's two founders used the sudden influx of investment capital to outfit their office with modern Danish furniture, in a sale brokered by the New York gallery Modern Now! in 1998. After the ensuing dot-com bust, Modern Now! was forced out of business, and Sotheby's auction house was put in charge of liquidating its inventory. The commission from that auction enabled auctioneer Mary Schafer to retire to the Ozark region of Missouri in 2006. Last month, while passing through Hazelwood, she took her Audi to Marlin Car Wash, where Kellener was one of the employees who tended to her car. She was so satisfied with the job that she left a $50 tip, which the manager divided among the people working that day.

""This money didn't just affect one life,"" Laffer said. ""It affected five.""

Prior to joining Marlin Car Wash in 2005, Kellener worked for nearly two decades at a local Ford assembly plant that is now defunct. Before that, he was employed by the FAA as an air traffic controller until his union went on strike and Reagan fired him, along with nearly 13,000 others. This is the largest tip he has received in his professional life.

Advertisement

""I thought Reaganomics was nothing more than a mirage that allowed President Reagan to reward his wealthy support base,"" Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-MA) said. ""But two generations later I am seeing Reaganomics in action, and I like what I see. It just took a little longer than I thought it was supposed to.""

The tip has not gone unnoticed by the economic team in the current administration.

Advertisement

""Had Mr. Kellener received that money in 1981, like the Democrats wanted, it would only be worth $4.24 today because of inflation,"" Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. said during an official announcement of the economic policy's success at a press conference Monday. ""Instead, Kellener has a solid $10 to spend right here and now. The system works, and our current president intends to keep making it work.""

Kellener, who has cared for his schizophrenic sister ever since her federally funded mental institution was closed in 1984, said that he plans to donate the full $10 to the Republican presidential candidate who best embodies Reagan's legacy.",771,4722,7,45
1,Nation Demands More Mind-Blowing Guitar Solos,https://entertainment.theonion.com/nation-demands-more-mind-blowing-guitar-solos-1819576265,"American citizens said they wanted a solo like Slash does on “Sweet Child O’ Mine,” but even faster.

WASHINGTON—Voicing their calls for heavy distortion and completely badass riffs, millions of Americans across the country fervently demanded a significant increase in the number of mind-blowing guitar solos Monday, sources nationwide confirmed.

Advertisement

Highlighting an unmistakable dearth of epic, amazing solos in recent years, Americans of all ages have reportedly called on the nation’s musicians to play technically difficult licks on their electric guitars, preferably at lightning-fast speeds, stressing the importance that the solos be both “loud as hell” and “totally insane.”

“When I turn on the radio, I want to hear a killer solo where the guy just totally shreds it hard,” said 36-year-old Kent, WA resident Michael Pellone, echoing the sentiments of the vast majority of citizens from coast to coast. “I want a solo so fast you can barely see the guy’s fingers moving—where the guy’s up on stage, one foot on top of a speaker, and just going nuts all over the guitar. That’s what I want.”

“And not one of those short solos either,” Pellone continued enthusiastically. “It’s gotta be, like, three minutes. Three minutes of this guy fucking wailing up there and making his guitar do those cool squealing sounds you hear a lot. Yeah, it has to have a lot of that.”

According to thousands of amped-up sources nationwide, a guitar solo in which the guy bends the strings really far while leaning his head back and grimacing is currently a top national priority. Additionally, citizens from all 50 states emphasized the importance of the guitarist running all over the stage, jumping off an amplifier, and then sliding on his knees through the lead singer’s legs while rocking out hard the entire time.

The U.S. populace also insisted that the solos contain several sections in which the guitarist uses his right hand to tap notes on the neck of the instrument just like Eddie Van Halen does in “Eruption.”

“I like when they’re just tearing it up on the low part of the guitar, but then they suddenly go up and play on the high part—they should do that lots of times,” said 31-year-old Mark Kessek of West Orange, NJ, adding that he really likes how it sounds when guitarists do long slides up and down the strings, so the solo should include a few of those. “I also like when they do that wah-wah effect thing—that has to be in there too. But the main thing is that it has to be really fast. So fast you’re just like, ‘Whoa, fuck yeah!’”

Advertisement

“Yeah!” added Kessek, excitedly making devil horns with his hands. “Pantera!”

According to a recent poll, 59 percent of Americans vehemently demanded that guitarists rip it up on a sweet double-neck guitar, frequently switching between the two fretboards like it’s nothing, while 84 percent called for an interlude midway through the solos during which another guitarist walks over and plays a cool harmony part alongside the lead. A further 73 percent said guitarists must at some point strum a really high note and simply let it ring while holding the guitar up with one hand, preferably while looking up and nodding at the crowd.

Advertisement

Moreover, 100 percent of respondents said that the guitarist should hit the whammy bar at the end of a particularly sick riff, with all respondents agreeing that such a maneuver would “kick ass.”

“What they should do is make the whole stage dark and then there’s a big spotlight on the guitarist guy, and there’s all this fog and smoke coming up around him too,” said 42-year-old Houston resident Samantha Pragle, noting that, ideally, the guitar should have some cool flames painted on it. “And it doesn’t just have to be one solo per song. A song could have a whole bunch of solos in it. Maybe the entire song could be a solo! Man, can you imagine how insane that would be? That would fucking rule!”

Advertisement

While unanimous in their demands for more unbelievable, earsplitting solos, the American public is reportedly divided over how the solos should end. According to sources, some have pressed for several amplifiers to be wildly kicked over after the last note, though others are staunchly in favor of seeing the soloist use his guitar strap to throw his instrument around his body, catch it, and then seamlessly transition into playing the song’s final chorus.

“I love guitar solos! I like when they play the guitar behind their head, just like this!” said Philadelphia accountant Alan Hurley, 57, closing his eyes and rapidly moving his fingers across an imaginary fretboard while making guitar sounds with his mouth. “Wa-na-na, neeow, wa-na, wa-now!”

Advertisement

“Wa-na-na-na,” Hurley added. “Na-na-neeow, wah-a-wow!”

At press time, tens of millions of enthusiastic Americans had reportedly cued up a YouTube video of Steve Vai’s “For The Love Of God” and cranked it all the way up.",828,4933,6,45

1,Today's Neo-Nazis Have No Respect For Tradition,https://www.theonion.com/todays-neo-nazis-have-no-respect-for-tradition-1819584345,"Karl Quandt



The other week, I read that the founder of the National Vanguard is in the clink for having child pornography in his computer. What is going on with today's white nationalists? Here it is, 2007, and global Aryan supremacy is no closer to becoming a reality than it was 60 years ago. I lay the blame squarely on the shoulders of this new generation. These kids today are making a disgrace of neo-Nazism.

Advertisement

In my day, it wasn't just about mindless hate—we hated because we stood for something. Namely, tradition, discipline, and self-respect: values that these low-life punks have no comprehension of whatsoever. We exalted our glorious forebears, in Germany as well as the United States. But who today remembers the great American neo-Nazi leaders like George Lincoln Rockwell or Matt Koehl? Who honors the great heroes and martyrs of the National Socialist White People's Party?

It's enough to make me ashamed to be a neo-Nazi.

You can't just call yourself the Master Race—you have to act like it, and hold yourself to a higher standard than those you despise and wish to exterminate. Have you seen the way these kids dress? Their idea of a ""uniform"" is a T-shirt and combat boots. The rural militias are even worse, with their filthy fatigues and long hair and beer guts. Excuse me, but I hardly think hillbilly rejects are what our great Führer had in mind when he dreamed of a world filled with Aryan supermen. I wouldn't even let them in my front door, let alone conspire with them to blow up a synagogue.

Advertisement

Don't these people have any white pride?

And don't get me started on the whole ""skinhead"" thing. What idiot came up with that idea? When everybody's bald, you can't even tell who's blond. Back in the '70s, we combed our hair neatly, wore starched, pressed brown shirts, and polished our jackboots until you could use them as mirrors. We always looked presentable, even when beating up Mexican migrant workers or sending hate mail to Jewish leaders. And if there was an organizational meeting, by golly, you showed up for it. If you were given a task, you did it: Those leaflets didn't pass themselves out.

Of course, that was back when being a neo-Nazi still meant something. Evidently, the neo-Nazis of today think that all you need to do to keep the fires of white nationalism burning is to carve a swastika on your chest or strap an armband around the sleeve of a dingy plaid-flannel shirt.

Breaking bottles, overturning garbage cans, spray-painting racial slurs, cranking out hour after mind-numbing hour of that ridiculous punk-rock music—you call that neo-Nazism? When we wanted to relax after a long day of marching in downtown Skokie, we sang good patriotic German anthems like the ""Horst Wessel Song.""

Advertisement

And the way these kids fight! Where's the skill? Sure, in the glory days of the 1930s, the Nazis doled out their fair share of beatings against the defenseless. But they did it with a little thing called ""class."" Watching these kids throw drunken punches and thrash around like netted trout in their mosh pits, I'd be shocked if more than three of them could even goose-step in a straight line. They couldn't make a train run on time if their lives depended on it, let alone conceive the V-2 rocket or Zyklon B.

I'll tell you one other thing—we weren't parked on our butts typing away on the Internet all day in some dank room surrounded by empty beer cans. We were at our remote Montana compounds, enjoying the rugged outdoors. We went on nature hikes, built huge bonfires, and held daily target practice so we'd be ready for the coming race war. All these nerds today want to do is make Web videos decrying the Zionist agenda. That reminds me—if you're going to appear online, the least you can do is shave. And if you must tattoo an eagle with an iron cross in its talons across your back, put on a shirt, for crying out loud. Tattoos aren't anything to brag about. Tattoos are for inking numbers on the forearms of Jews.

Advertisement

I also hear that when these kids are in prison, they spend their time sodomizing each other. Why, when we were in prison, we took advantage of our extra time to write manifestos and memorize The Turner Diaries. Buggery was the furthest thing from our mind—we saved our essence for propagating the white race when we got out.

I suppose this new generation will probably call me an old geezer, just because I still believe in putting on a tie before giving the Hitler salute. But damn it, if we can't live up to the values that made Nazism great, we might as well just not have any neo-Nazi movement at all.",811,4635,7,47

1,Free Condom Harsh Reminder Of Sexless Existence,https://local.theonion.com/free-condom-harsh-reminder-of-sexless-existence-1819566708,"SANTA CRUZ, CA—A free condom served as a harsh reminder of the sexless existence Julie Tudor has endured since February 2002, the 31-year-old bookstore manager reported Tuesday.

The condom and brochure for which Tudor had little need.

Advertisement

""Uh, thanks,"" said Tudor, reluctantly accepting a LifeStyles Xtra Pleasure condom attached to a brochure containing detailed information on proper use of the prophylactic. ""But I really don't, uh, okay, thanks.""

At approximately 2 p.m., while cutting across the University of California–Santa Cruz campus en route to a coffee shop, Tudor encountered a table featuring a hand-painted sign urging passersby to practice safe sex. She was immediately offered a condom by Stephanie Loughlin, a volunteer for the campus organization UC–Santa Cruz Safe-Sex Alliance.

""I could've told them to save it for someone who has even a remote chance of actually using it, but I still have some dignity,"" said Tudor, who hasn't needed a prophylactic since her Feb. 14, 2002 split with then-boyfriend Doug Ryback. ""God, if they only knew how little they were helping me.""

Tudor said she smiled politely when Loughlin, a bubbly 20-year-old, bounded up to her and urged her to ""play it safe.""

""I didn't want to say that in the 11 months since Doug and I broke up, I really haven't been 'playing it' at all,"" Tudor said. ""Thanks for reminding me.""

Tudor said she still has plenty of unused condoms at home.

""I have a box that hasn't been touched since the breakup,"" Tudor said. ""I know they're still there, because I checked for them before going out with that jerk stockbroker Michelle set me up with last month.""

Advertisement

Tudor

Tudor initially tried to avoid the safe-sex booth, pretending not to hear Safe-Sex Alliance volunteer Ryan Schumann when he shouted, ""Free condom?"" Misinterpreting Tudor's efforts to sidestep the booth as discomfort with the subject of sex, Schumann targeted her for additional education.

Advertisement

""Some people don't like talking about sex, which is why outreach programs like ours are so vitally important,"" said Schumann, 19. ""I told her not to be embarrassed, and that sexuality is a normal, healthy part of everyone's life.'""

""Everyone's except mine,"" Tudor replied when told of Schumann's remarks. ""I decided to spare him that detail, though, and let him blather on about mutual respect and positive sexuality and something about a dance at the student union on the last Friday of every month.""

Advertisement

Despite not needing protection from unwanted pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases, Tudor was offered a choice of condoms by Trojan, Durex, Trustex, inSpiral, and Crown—all placed in a fishbowl along with complimentary packets of Astroglide lubricant and Wet-brand flavored lube pillows.

""When I sort of frowned at the condom in my hand, they pulled me over to pick any that I liked better from their cornucopia of condoms,"" Tudor said. ""Lubricated, non-lubricated, for-her-pleasure, for-his, mint-flavored. They even had ones wrapped in foil that looked like candy coins. Which, I hate to admit, caught my eye for a second. Chocolate, I would've had some use for.""

Advertisement

Declining the offer of an alternate condom, Tudor grudgingly accepted a brochure containing ""fun and safe"" sex practices to try with her purely theoretical partner. She also took a printed sheet listing local health clinics that provide free testing for STDs, a brochure on the correct use of dental dams, and a photocopy of an article about female condoms—none of which remotely interested her.

In the two weeks since Tudor's last major sex-related letdown—her failure to get laid on New Year's Eve despite a willingness to sleep with anyone even slightly attractive—sex had largely been relegated to the back of her mind. On Tuesday, however, Tudor was reminded of her sexless existence every time she opened her purse and saw the free condom.

Advertisement

""Back in college, when I was screwing with reasonable regularity, I'd actually spend time thinking about the subject [of safe sex],"" Tudor said. ""I'd worry if carrying a condom in my purse was being too forward. I'd think, is it okay to have sex with friends? What sort of stuff do I want to explore? Are threesomes safe? I had no idea that one day, my safe-sex questions would boil down to, 'Where can I get some?'""

Loughlin, who has volunteered for UC–Santa Cruz Safe-Sex Alliance since September, said she sees the unwillingness of some people to discuss sex as a problem facing safe-sex activists.

Advertisement

""Some people are, like, really weird about sex, and that totally sucks,"" said Loughlin, adjusting a ""Be On The Safe Side!"" banner. ""That's why I'm here. The more open everyone is about it, the less people will die.""

""God, I remember back when I was her age,"" Tudor said. ""I was dating this guy who lived in Arizona, but I kept cheating on him with this guy on my dorm floor: Kyle? Karl? He was a rock climber, a real outdoorsy type—kinda skinny but strong. You know, with these nice knotty muscles. I'm sorry, what was your question?""",837,5104,7,47

But this achievement is really about the artists on our platform. Spotify couldn’t have done it without you.” To celebrate the occasion, Spotify also reportedly unveiled a new commemorative playlist of its highest-earning artists, with all proceeds from plays going to Spotify.

Those students whose fingerings have been confirmed include 14-year-old Lacy DeWitt, 15-year-old Jamie Cavanaugh, and freshman class president Kelly Oswald.

Advertisement

Two-thirds of the fingerings occurred before the freshman class reached the National Museum of Natural History.

Rumors of a fourth fingering remain unsubstantiated, though students noted that during Friday's showing of Cosmic Collisions at the National Air and Space Museum, Brian Rupp and Laura Burkholder sat in the back of the planetarium far away from chaperones.

Advertisement

Burkholder was reportedly wearing a skirt at the time.

""We expect our students to be on their best behavior here in Washington,"" said vice principal Tom Molinaro, who is known to often fall asleep during bus rides, thus increasing the chances of a fingering taking place. ""Remember, we're representing our school here.""

According to students, the first fingering occurred Thursday at 8:32 a.m., when Jared Geyer, using a Middleton Football hooded sweatshirt for cover, fingered girlfriend Lacy DeWitt roughly 90 minutes into the six-hour trip to the nation's capital.

""I knew Jared was fingering her,"" classmate Matt Shearer told reporters. ""They were laughing with each other and then they got real quiet.""

Advertisement

Added Shearer, ""Before the trip Jared said he was going to finger her.""

The second fingering reportedly took place Thursday night at the hotel after chaperones failed to notice that Nick Stern had been hiding in Jamie Cavanaugh's bathroom during a 10 p.m. room check. After the two chaperones left, Stern exited the bathroom and proceeded to finger Cavanaugh from approximately 10:13 p.m. to 10:17 p.m.

Advertisement

Kelly Oswald, recipient of the trip's third confirmed fingering, was fingered by Greg Wandel on Friday behind the FDR Memorial.

While the official count remains at three, students speculated that as many as 20 of their classmates have been or will be fingered before the trip's end. However, ninth-grade sources have ruled out any chance of 15-year-old Emily Blankenship being fingered, felt up, or even touched, for that matter.

Advertisement

""I guarantee Dave Hilland will finger Jessica Swink,"" Geoff Schroyer told reporters, adding that Hilland fingered Swink during last summer's whale-watching trip in Boston. ""If not tonight, then definitely during the bus ride back. Either way, he'll finger her.""

In addition to those who could be getting fingered at this very moment, four other students have reportedly been the object of attempted fingerings, one of which was interrupted when a chaperone entered the railcar exhibit at the Holocaust Memorial Museum. According to Jason Schilling, there was no actual finger insertion, though contact with pubic hair was made.

Advertisement

Others who have been implicated in alleged fingerings include Allison Maida, whose whereabouts between 3:30 p.m. and 3:45 p.m. Friday remain unknown.

""She was probably getting fingered,"" Joey Ross, 14, said.

When last available for comment, students said that Michael Biller and Carrie Washburn had stayed behind as their tour group left a monument—the name of which they could not recall—and that the situation would likely end with Washburn being ""finger slammed.""

Advertisement

""I think these trips are so important because they get the kids out of their little bubble back at school,"" said chaperone and ninth-grade history teacher Heidi DeWitt, whose daughter has been fingered twice during the excursion. ""Washington, D.C. is such an amazing city. I'm sure this will be an experience these kids will never forget.""",583,3814,8,48

Something is amiss in these United States. A pall cast over the land that forebodes a looming sense of dread. The laughter of average Americans is no more than a thin mask that barely conceals the anxiety we all feel. But to this, the greatest nation on Earth, I say: Why do you look so down in the mouth? Don't you know that tomorrow is another day? You're acting like there's a war on, for Pete's sake! And even if there is, you know what? That's something you just can't do anything about. So why dwell in Dumpsville when you can take a trolley to Happytown?

I know, I know. You're worried about global warming, aren't you? That's okay. If you live in a low-lying coastal area, like 53 percent of our population does, then you are in danger of having everything you love lost to flooding. Well, roll up your pants and wade right in is what I say, because if life gives you water, it's time to go swimming!

Speaking of water, you know what I do when I'm feeling blue about a sharp spike in crime and drug use? When seven local kids overdose and die a painful death because they didn't understand the ramifications of their actions? I draw myself a bubble bath and slip into a good book. After a while, you'll be saying, ""What OxyContin epidemic?""

Buck up, America. Yes, with a fluctuating market hinging on nothing more than the whims of Fed Chief Ben Bernanke, it sure does seem like economic disaster is on the horizon. But it's not the end of the world. Why, just the other day, I lost $10 at the supermarket. All that means is clipping more coupons—for me and for everyone!

By golly, why can't you be more like Hawaii? They're all hula dancing like nobody's business. They don't seem to mind that the deflating dollar is keeping American tourists away, no sir. They're eating poi and having luaus like they're going out of style. Now, we may not all have coconuts, but some of you sure do have the same sunny weather to enjoy while you sit in your uninsurable homes.

You know who I'm talking about, Florida.

Who's a crabby democracy? Huh? Maybe some cookies would make you feel better, Iowa. Sure, subsidized corn prices have made you Washington's escort, but that's no reason to be a sour puss.

Go on, Texas Panhandle, get yourself all worked up about the immigrant crisis. See if I care! I've got problems of my own to deal with. My car needs a new alternator, and my kids don't mind me like they should.

1,Why Do All These Homosexuals Keep Sucking My Cock?,https://www.theonion.com/why-do-all-these-homosexuals-keep-sucking-my-cock-1819584210,"Bruce Heffernan



Look, I'm not a hateful person or anything—I believe we should all live and let live. But lately, I've been having a real problem with these homosexuals. You see, just about wherever I go these days, one of them approaches me and starts sucking my cock.

Advertisement

Take last Sunday, for instance, when I casually struck up a conversation with this guy in the health-club locker room. Nothing fruity, just a couple of fellas talking about their workout routines while enjoying a nice hot shower. The guy looked like a real man's man, too—big biceps, meaty thighs, thick neck. He didn't seem the least bit gay. At least not until he started sucking my cock, that is.

Where does this queer get the nerve to suck my cock? Did I look gay to him? Was I wearing a pink feather boa without realizing it? I don't recall the phrase, ""Suck my cock"" entering the conversation, and I don't have a sign around my neck that reads, ""Please, You Homosexuals, Suck My Cock.""

Advertisement

I've got nothing against homosexuals. Let them be free to do their gay thing in peace, I say. But when they start sucking my cock, I've got a real problem.

Then there was the time I was hiking through the woods and came across a rugged-looking, blond-haired man in his early 30s. He seemed straight enough to me while we were bathing in that mountain stream, but, before you know it, he's sucking my cock!

What is it with these homos? Can't they control their sexual urges? Aren't there enough gay cocks out there for them to suck on without them having to target normal people like me?

Believe me, I have no interest in getting my cock sucked by some queer. But try telling that to the guy at the beach club. Or the one at the video store. Or the one who catered my wedding. Or any of the countless other homos who've come on to me recently. All of them sucked my cock, and there was nothing I could do to stop them.

Advertisement

I tell you, when a homosexual is sucking your cock, a lot of strange thoughts go through your head: How the hell did this happen? Where did this fairy ever get the idea that I was gay? And where did he get those fantastic boots?

It screws with your head at other times, too. Every time a man passes me on the street, I'm afraid he's going to grab me and drag me off to some bathroom to suck my cock. I've even started to visualize these repulsive cock-sucking episodes during the healthy, heterosexual marital relations I enjoy with my wife—even some that haven't actually happened, like the sweaty, post-game locker-room tryst with Vancouver Canucks forward Mark Messier that I can't seem to stop thinking about.

Things could be worse, I suppose. It could be women trying to suck my cock, which would be adultery and would make me feel tremendously guilty. As it is, I'm just angry and sickened. But, believe me, that's enough. I don't know what makes these homosexuals mistake me for a guy who wants his cock sucked, and, frankly, I don't want to know. I just wish there were some way to get them to stop.

I've tried all sorts of things, but it's all been to no avail. A few months back, I started wearing an intimidating-looking black leather thong with menacing metal studs in the hopes that it would frighten those faggots off, but it didn't work. In fact, it only seemed to encourage them. Then, I really started getting rough, slapping them around whenever they were sucking my cock, but that failed, too. Even pulling out of their mouths just before ejaculation and shooting sperm all over their face, chest, and hair seemed to have no effect. What do I have to do to get the message across to these swishes?

I swear, if these homosexuals don't take a hint and quit sucking my cock all the time, I'm going to have to resort to drastic measures—like maybe pinning them down to the cement floor of the loading dock with my powerful forearms and working my cock all the way up their butt so they understand loud and clear just how much I disapprove of their unwelcome advances.

Phase 4 will also need all of you to start going into restaurants and stores without masks and pretending that this is endangering absolutely no one.

1,Millions Without Power Following Election [Classic],https://politics.theonion.com/millions-without-power-following-election-1819574165,"People all across the country are reporting being without power in the wake of Tuesday’s presidential election.

WASHINGTON—According to widespread reports, roughly 314 million Americans across the country have been left without any power following Tuesday’s devastating presidential election.

As many struggle to cope amidst the continued outage, experts have predicted that due to the severity of the presidential contest, which cut a wide swath of carnage throughout the entire United States, it’s very possible that power won’t be fully restored to the general public for at least another four years, if ever.

“By our estimates, power is out in roughly 150 million homes throughout the country, and many residents—especially the poor, the middle class, and ethnic minorities—will have no power for a long, long time,” said Cornell University political scientist Dr. Paul Kucharski, adding that the power infrastructure, which was originally put in place in 1789, has become increasingly problematic and unreliable over the past 200 years. “Given that we have an outdated system that is so prone to failure, an outage of this magnitude was inevitable.”

“At this point,” he continued, “with the number of citizens whose lives have been completely devastated by this election, I think it’s fairly clear that the whole system needs a complete overhaul.”

Reports of sweeping power failures began surfacing Tuesday in the late evening, with the election wreaking havoc across the entire Eastern Seaboard, first knocking out power in Massachusetts, New York, and Maryland. As more and more results came in and the election grew in intensity, power outages were eventually reported in Pennsylvania, in Indiana, and stretching as far west as Colorado and California.

By approximately 11 p.m., power had reportedly been cut off to all states, including Alaska and Hawaii.

“I was watching the returns on television, they called a winner in my state, and then I was just totally without power,” said 35-year-old Dalton, GA resident Chris Orloff, adding that the election has left him totally in the dark and with no one to turn to. “Even though we were warned the election was going to happen on Nov. 6, there was just no way to avoid this thing.”

“I thought it would be bad, but I honestly didn’t think it would be this bad.” Orloff added. “Best thing to do now is hunker down with my family and get used to not having power for a while.”

Advertisement

According to sources, the power outage has left millions without access to proper health care, adequate shelter, and basic goods and services. Moreover, public school officials said that if the power loss continues—as it is expected to for the foreseeable future—it will be impossible to continue educating students.

Many in the medical community told reporters that the harmful elections and resulting loss of power could lead to a record number of deaths.

Though a majority of Americans said the outage has left them scared and helpless, some were angered, arguing that as taxpayers, they deserve access to power. Others remarked they have simply gotten used to the unstable, highly unreliable electoral system and its long history of knocking out power to citizens when they need it most.

“Unfortunately, we lose power around here all the time,” said Florida-based marketing consultant Erika Lloyd, explaining that she endured a much more crippling power failure in 2000. “Any time an election happens, even if it’s a small, statewide one, our power goes out immediately after the ballots are counted.”

Advertisement

With no end to the crisis in sight, Americans have expressed growing frustration, complaining that they feel completely abandoned by those they rely on to provide them with power.

“People always come around here every three or four years talking about how they’re going to repair the system and restore our power, but then another election happens and it just gets worse,” said 58-year-old mechanic John Rhodes, who, along with other tenants in his government-subsidized housing complex in Camden, NJ, has been living without power for more than four decades. “I mean, look around you. Does it seem like any of the power issues have been addressed here?”

LOS ANGELES—According to reports, 29-year-old online commentator Caroline Shelham is somehow not completely ashamed of her own well-established identity as a ""pop culture expert.""

Advertisement

Shelham, who spends 10 hours every day consuming news updates on various entertainers and then commenting on their activities on an entertainment website, has reportedly shown no signs of humiliation or self-hatred over the way she spends the bulk of her time, and is also apparently not disgusted by the fact that this is actually what she does with her life.

""Basically, I like to look at what's going on in pop culture and comment on it with a sort of fresh, wry voice,"" said Shelham, who by all accounts still possesses the ability to look at herself in the mirror every morning. ""I try to find things that I think are really lame and vacuous and then just tear them apart.""

""I guess I see my role as being like an arbiter of what sucks and what doesn't in the world of show biz,"" added Shelham, seemingly under the sad impression that her work or existence has a meaningful use to society or the human race. ""Somebody's got to do it.""

According to Shelham, this week alone she has penned what she refers to with a straight face as ""news stories"" about the separation of actors Courteney Cox and David Arquette; a photograph of the singer Rihanna wearing a new outfit; and an advertisement for an upcoming episode of a television sitcom, all of which she was surprisingly willing to take credit for having written and disseminated.

She also composed a scathing, 800-word critique of the upcoming motion picture Burlesque that she suggested, with actual pride, was ""some of [her] best work.""

""I'm sorry, but it might be just about time for [Burlesque actress] Cher to go away now,"" wrote Shelham, who does not seem to find anything self-degrading in the fact that she earns a living by deriding people she does not, nor will ever, know. ""I know you're doing your best to make us forget that we actually found you charming in Moonstruck, but let's just call it a day already, shall we?""

Shelham—the daughter of a small business owner and a retired nurse who paid for her to attend a liberal arts college—recently spent a large portion of what in her mind is somehow a day's work creating an itemized list entitled ""10 Things I Hate About This Season Of Dancing With The Stars"" that she accepted money for writing and allowed to be published without apologizing to her loved ones for the despicable action.

She was also among the first to find out that Ian Ziering is expecting a baby—a fact that she remains inexplicably proud of having learned nearly 14 hours before the general public.

Advertisement

""Why in the name of God would anybody even pay attention to Jessica Simpson anymore?"" she recently asked without any sudden pangs of overwhelming regret or self-loathing. ""I think it's high time somebody told her that nobody cares.""

Though Shelham is an actual human being, her choice to intentionally put effort toward commenting on actor Kelsey Grammer's love life and the televised interactions of a group of New Jersey twentysomethings has evidently not caused her to contemplate the act of suicide.

1,Nazi SS Cemetery Desecrated By Pro-Semitic Graffiti,https://www.theonion.com/nazi-ss-cemetery-desecrated-by-pro-semitic-graffiti-1819564836/,"DARMSTADT, GERMANY–Residents of this quiet Rhineland city awoke Monday to discover that Heinrich Himmler Memorial Cemetery, the final resting place of over 200 Nazi SS Officers who gave their lives for Germany in World War II, had been desecrated during the night with pro-Semitic graffiti.

""This is horrible, simply horrible,"" said a tearful Grete Brautig, who found the headstone of her grandfather, Waffen-SS Oberlieutenant Otto Brautig, defaced with a spray-painted Star of David. ""Why would anyone want to do such an awful, hateful thing to my grosspapa, a man who loved and fought for his country?""

According to Darmstadt police, sometime between the hours of 1 and 6 a.m., unknown persons vandalized the grave markers of dozens of prominent SS men with pro-Semitic graffiti, including Jewish stars and slogans like ""Chosen People"" and ""Next Year In Jerusalem.""

Advertisement

It is believed to be the worst pro-Semitic crime in Darmstadt history.

""You must understand, the Star of David is an incredibly painful symbol for my people,"" said former Hitler Youth member Conrad Steuben, 67, whose father, SS-Unterscharführer Erich Steuben, was buried with full military honors at Darmstadt in 1945. ""It stands for the destruction of us and everything we believe in. Seeing it scrawled across those gravestones reopens many deep wounds.""

""I thought we had put pro-Semitism behind us here in Darmstadt,"" Steuben said. ""But I suppose old prejudices die hard.""

Darmstadt police, working closely with the Nazi Anti-Defamation League, are committed to bringing the perpetrators to justice.

Advertisement

""This sort of hate crime must not be tolerated,"" police chief Klaus Meine said. ""We will do everything in our power to find the Jews responsible for this.""

The vandalism is not the first incident of pro-Semitism to occur in Darmstadt. In 1991, a group of Zionists marched through the streets of the city, waving Israeli flags and chanting in Hebrew. City leaders filed a court injunction in an effort to block the march, but the Zionists, defended by the German Civil Liberties Union, won.

""I will never forgive the GCLU for defending the Zionists,"" Steuben said. ""I am all for free speech, but that crossed the line.""

Support for the people of Darmstadt has poured in from across Germany in the form of letters, donations and personal visits from political figures.

""Once more, Germans have become the victims of hatred, prejudice and intolerance,"" said former Austrian president Kurt Waldheim in a speech given in the Darmstadt town plaza. ""This incident serves as a reminder that we must remain vigilant about preserving the memory of the four million Germans who died during World War II, so that similar tragedies can be prevented in the future. Never again.""",448,2822,7,51

I am destined to wander the frozen food aisle trying to balance two cans of diced tomatoes and bunch of bananas on a six-pack of seltzer in one hand, to dangle a three-pound sack of potatoes from a single pinky finger going numb, to curse myself after realizing I have no idea how I’ll ever carry these chicken breasts, the main thing I came here for. Why, oh why did I think I could forgo a basket when even an entire cart would not be unreasonable to carry all of the items I’m now doomed to balance precariously in nothing but my own two hands? How could I have fooled myself into thinking that I was only here for a few things, to ignore what I know about sizes and weight, to forget my own weakness for grabbing chips and then salsa despite knowing that I cannot carry them without risking catastrophe, to turn up my nose at this establishment’s humble offer of a basket? Yet I have come too far to ever turn back, and I must let the past remain in the past. Only fate will tell if this glass jar of expensive organic jam can remain lodged in the crook of my elbow for the rest of my journey.” At press time, McClendon was cursing himself for his lack of foresight after declining the checkout cashier’s offer of plastic bags to carry his items out of the store.

For far too long I've sat idly by, twiddling my thumbs and respecting the right of others to form thoughts and opinions independent of my own, and I can't take it anymore. I've got to speak up about the many things that annoy me or I'm going to go crazy. Take these new credit cards with the microchips in them, for instance. Man, those things really get my goat—trying to improve a device that was working perfectly fine as it was. Even worse are those wrappers on CDs that take forever to open. But you know what I hate the most? The one thing that makes my blood boil whenever I see it? Anything beyond my mental capacity, that's what.

God, all the people, places, and things I haven't made the least bit of effort to comprehend should just die already.

Will you look at all this stuff I have neither the intellect nor the maturity level to process? What a load of crap. It's in my face every day, doing lots of things I don't have an immediate desire to do and saying things I can't identify with at this stage in my life. How lame is that? I mean, what kind of pathetic loser would actually enjoy something that's so incredibly not among my personal preferences? Not me, that's for sure.

Maybe my standards are too high, but if you like any of the hundreds upon hundreds of things that are too multifaceted for my attention span, you should have your head examined, weirdo.

And don't even get me started on complex and sophisticated notions I can't possibly wrap my head around. That stuff makes me want to puke. Just knowing there are people out there who like—actually like—interacting with concepts that overwhelm my feeble consciousness makes me embarrassed to be an American. I don't like it in our homes, I don't like it in our schools, I don't like it outside of my comfort zone—well, I just plain don't like it. And if that makes me closed-minded, well, then I guess I'll have to dismiss that accusation outright in order to avoid being introspective even for a moment.

Why, only yesterday I saw a commercial on TV for a new product I have no immediate use for and therefore cannot see any value in. Who's making this worthless junk? Seriously. If I see one more household appliance I am not mature enough to own or operate, I'm going to punch someone. I swear. Sell that to the suckers with the money and inclination to buy it, because I wouldn't take it off your hands if you gave it to me, provided me with a living situation stable enough to house it, and showed me how to use it in a manner that didn't disrupt any of my cripplingly sedentary lifestyle habits.

Same goes with any TV show, movie, band, solo act, artist, book, burgeoning subculture, celebrity, fashion trend, or religious belief that makes me feel excluded from my peers or otherwise ostracized by the mainstream. That stuff is retarded.

That's the way it's always been as far as I know, and that's the way it's going to be until such time as I choose to acknowledge diversity among the earth's 6.6 billion people.

If things don't start changing around here, I might have to up and leave this town. It's gotten to the point where I can't walk down the street without having some flier thrust into my face, advertising some dumb concert or stupid party or annoying art festival or lame-o Minnesota primary or any number of other events that no sane person with a crippling fear of the unknown and a wildly underdeveloped imagination would ever want to go to.

But for Seth Nussbaum, it will be just another lonely evening.

Nussbaum

""For some reason, they've decided to leave me out of the worldwide Jewish conspiracy,"" said Nussbaum, a 34-year-old computer programmer. ""And I can't say it doesn't hurt.""

While his fellow Jews are controlling the flow of billions of dollars of international currency and brokering multi million-dollar entertainment deals, on this quiet night Nussbaum is making himself a frozen pizza and watching ER, far removed from any money beyond the $28,000 annual salary he receives from his job at Cyntech Industries.

""Who's to say I wouldn't enjoy hoarding a little gold every now and then?"" he said, his voice tinged with bitterness. ""Believe me, I'd love to be able to sneak around behind the scenes like the Elders of Zion, pulling the strings and holding the real power in society. But I guess when it comes to working the Jerusalem-New York-L.A. triangle, I just wasn't one of the chosen people.""

Unlike millions of other Jews around the world, Nussbaum holds no sway over the media, has no powerful friends within the Wall Street banking community or the Trilateral Commission, and has never run a major Hollywood studio.

Though its influence stretches to all corners of the globe, the worldwide Jewish conspiracy has, for mysterious reasons, neglected to include Southfield, MI, computer programmer Seth Nussbaum.

In fact, Nussbaum doesn't even own so much as his own production company. ""Spielberg, Geffen, Ovitz, Eisner, Katzenberg—those are the Jews who control Hollywood,"" Nussbaum said. ""And there's countless other Jews calling the shots at every level of the entertainment industry, from agents to producers to directors. But me? I probably couldn't even get the studio backing for a $15 to $20 million romantic comedy with a mid-level star like Matthew Broderick.""

And despite being a regular subscriber to The New York Times for seven years, Nussbaum has no powerful connections among the Jews who own that and every other newspaper in the United States.

""As a left-leaning Jew, I should enjoy vast influence over the press. I should be able use the papers and television stations I own to forward my biased, liberal Jewish agenda and get Israel-supporting Democratic candidates elected to Congress,"" said Nussbaum, sitting on the old futon he uses as a couch. ""But somehow, that's just not the case.""

WASHINGTON—Following news that author J.K. Rowling had secretly authored the crime novel The Cuckoo’s Calling under the pen name Robert Galbraith earlier this year, multiple reports confirmed today that Rowling, widely known as the author of the popular Harry Potter series of books, is actually the longtime pseudonym of former house speaker Newt Gingrich, who created the boy wizard and penned all seven of the bestselling novels. “Assuming a fake identity really gave me a lot of freedom to build out the world of Hogwarts and flesh out the characters without drawing unwanted attention to myself or having the novels associated in any way with my political career,” Gingrich said in a statement, confirming reports he wrote the first four books in the fantasy series while still in office, but wrote the remainder before his 2012 presidential run. “I am happy readers enjoyed my books, as I myself have always felt a very strong personal connection to Harry, Dumbledore, Hermione, and all of my other characters. Honestly, I miss them all every day.” Gingrich went on to say while he mostly tried to keep his political life separate from his fiction, the character of Ron Weasley was based almost entirely on Tom Daschle.",213,1302,9,55

Hey there. Remember me? I'm that kid who had a report due on space. You probably don't recognize me because it was a long time ago. I used to wear my hair totally different. It was in this sort of Prince Valiant-style pageboy bowl cut. Hey, it was the mid-'80s, what can I say? Sometimes, I look at old pictures of me, with that hair, and I think to myself, ""You sure have come a long way since the days when you had that report due on space.""

Advertisement

You sure you don't remember me? That kid? Who had a report due? On space?

For a couple years afterwards, I'd get recognized pretty often. People would come up to me and be like, ""You look so familiar. Where do I know you from?"" And then I'd say, ""Encyclopedia Britannica. I'm that kid who had a report due on space,"" and they'd slap their foreheads and be all like, ""I knew I recognized you from somewhere! How'd that report turn out, anyway? Those encyclopedias help?"" I'd usually just play it kind of coy, giving 'em the old thumbs up and saying, ""Scored an A."" Sometimes, they'd even buy me a drink, but that doesn't happen much anymore. After all, that was 15 or 20 years ago now that I had that report due on space.

Not that I'm hung up on it. I've moved on since then. I don't want you to get the wrong idea and think I'm living in the past.

I guess after that whole report thing, a lot of people, myself included, figured I'd end up going into some line of work having to do with aeronautics or astrophysics or something that was at least somehow associated with space. But that's not what happened.

Oh, sure, I went to college. As a matter of fact, I included that report I had due on space in my application. So I guess those encyclopedias paid off in that respect. To be honest, though, I wasn't all that into school. I spent most of my college years partying. Oh, man, I remember this one kegger, me and my buddies had been doing Jell-O shots all night. And, well, to make a long story short, this totally hot girl comes up—she'd been checking me out all night—and she finally approaches me and is all like, ""Do I know you? Aren't you that kid who had a report due on space?"" I was sure I was going home with her, but she ended up passing out.

Sorry to go off on that tangent there. Long story short, I ended up dropping out of college after three semesters. It was too bad, because I had those encyclopedias, and they would've been a really good resource for reports on Napoleon or mitosis or the migratory patterns of birds or whatever. But, like I said, college just wasn't for me.

Advertisement

I ended up going to Alaska for a few years, to try to get my head together. I hardly brought anything with me, but for some reason, I packed those damn encyclopedias. They came in pretty handy during those long months working at the cannery. After a hard shift, when I just wanted to unwind and read something to cope with the horrible boredom and isolation, I'd flip open the encyclopedia. In the cold arctic night, it was a real comfort to read those things and be reminded of a time when life was simpler and seemed so full of promise—back when I was a fresh-faced young kid who had that report due on space.

After that, I kind of bummed around for a while, sort of directionless. I finally ended up in Boulder, working at this snowboard shop. By that point, hardly anybody remembered that I was that kid who had a report due on space. In fact, when I met my wife Robyn—or I should say ex-wife Robyn—she didn't even know about the report. To her, I was just that guy who worked at the snowboard shop with her brother Kurt. And I didn't mind. That whole report-due-on-space thing seemed long ago, and when we moved in together, I decided to close that whole chapter in my life by getting rid of the encyclopedias.

Advertisement

I know, I know. Maybe I should've kept them for sentimental value, but it was time to move on. I was looking forward to starting a new life with Robyn and the baby, and the last thing I needed was to remain mired in the past, thinking about that report I once had due on space.

It's too bad about Robyn. We gave it a go for a good five years or so, but it didn't work out. She ended up heading down to Arizona where her sisters live, and we're still friends—I mean, we keep in touch, but I don't know. Just wasn't meant to be, I suppose. She wanted to study to be a registered nurse. I offered to go find the guy in my building who I gave the encyclopedias to and see if I could get them back for her. You know, in case she ever had a report due on stethoscopes or taking people's blood pressure or something, but she said the class provided a textbook that had everything she needed. I miss her sometimes. But, hey, that's life, right?

Advertisement

Anyhow, I left Boulder shortly after that. The apartment was just too lonely, and since I didn't have the encyclopedias or the wife, I didn't need that much room anymore.

Sure is funny how life works out. I mean, if you'd asked me 15 or 20 years ago, back when I had that report due on space, what I was going to end up doing with my life, I never thought I'd wake up in my early 30s and find myself managing a U-Store-It facility in Tallahassee. But I can't complain. I've lived a pretty interesting life, even if it wasn't always what I expected. Besides, I'll always have my memories—and that report on space.",1023,5419,12,55

1,BREAKING: ‘The Onion’ Has Obtained The IRS Tax Form 1040,https://politics.theonion.com/breaking-the-onion-has-obtained-the-irs-tax-form-104-1845206128,"The duty of a free press has always been to provide readers with a comprehensive and unvarnished picture of the world writ large. Though governments and their officials may strive to conceal vital documents from the public eye, The Onion insists that true journalism consists in shedding light upon even the darkest corners of our society. That is why today, thanks to the intrepid actions of one anonymous source, our editorial board has chosen to reveal that it possesses a copy of the IRS tax form 1040.



Advertisement

The revelations from these pages are, to put it bluntly, monumental.



Since receiving the tax form—often considered one of the most hotly sought-after records in recent American history—our substantial team of 327 fact-checkers, reporters, and legal experts have spent tireless nights to trawl through its depths, extracting explosive details about the function of standardized deductions for heads of household and married couples filing separately. Although the 1040 form pages fell into our editorial department’s hands in early 2019, it has taken nearly 18 months of around-the-clock examination to fully grasp its precise scale and ramification for the American people.



Indeed, the document tells a far different and potentially more damning story than the rumor mill surrounding the 1040 have suggested: earned income credit, Alaska Permanent Fund dividends, dependents. For years, the role of such terms—long presumed by our editorial board to be crucial components in understanding income tax filing—have been discounted as overblown hearsay. Yet here, they offer tantalizing glimpses at a larger whole, filling in the picture to render a dizzying understanding of precisely how and why an individual would file, say, using joint marital status.

We have chosen to publish our understanding of these records despite the extraordinary legal and physical threats that we will likely face. Additionally, in a contentious election year between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden we will surely face blowback from pundits for potentially upending the race with the explosive details about the form’s “wages, salaries tips, etc...” section and what it implies about the elusive form known only as W-2.

Of course, uncertainties will continue to dog our investigation: Namely, what is the form 1099-INT or the form 8888? And how does “adjusted gross income” differ from “taxable income”? What is the total income after adding lines 1, 2b, 3b, 4b, 4d, 5b, 6, and 7a? Such answers lie beyond our power as faithful custodians of the truth to furnish without delving into the rank speculation that has long plagued other lesser news outlets.

Nonetheless, we are confident that publication of the form known as 1040 represents the proper step forward for the truth, for The Onion and for the nation as a whole. These pages represent perhaps the most detailed look yet at the government’s dealings in taxation, and despite the tremendous risks we incurred through their procurement, it is incumbent upon us as stewards of the great journalistic tradition of truth-telling to provide these documents to the public. May the American people deal with them thoughtfully, and may a benevolent God guide our hand in reacting to their terrifying implications.

An additional 13 percent said they ""couldn't give a flying fuck about the whole goddamn thing.""

The poll also found that the National Shit-Credulity Index (NSCI) has hit an all-time low, with only 2 percent of Americans describing themselves as ""fully confident of [their] capacity to believe this shit.""

""The American people have had to deal with this kind of shit for years,"" Gallup Organization president Lee Sanderson said, ""but now, for the first time, it appears that the vast majority of them just can't fucking believe it anymore.""

""In all honesty, who can blame them?"" Sanderson added. ""Regardless of one's political affiliation, socioeconomic status, religion or just about any other viewpoint, you've got to admit, the shit that's been going on lately is way out of hand.""

In the wake of the poll, many activists are calling upon America's leaders to get their shit in gear.

""The American people have had it up to here with this shitheap,"" said James Schuerholz, president of the D.C.-based Heritage Foundation. ""There is a public mandate for our leaders to cut this shit out, and it's high time they finally did.""

Despite Americans' incredulity over this shit, historians note that this sort of shit has been going on for years and is unlikely to end anytime soon.

""Contrary to popular belief, this type of shit is hardly anything new,"" Harvard University American history professor Lawrence Coombs said. ""The same shit was going down 50, 100 and 150 years ago. The only difference was, back then, you never read about that shit in the newspapers.""

Calling the American people's enormous shit-belief capacity ""one of the cornerstones of our democracy,"" U.S. Sen. John Kerry (D-MA) stressed that it is the patriotic duty of all citizens to grant our leaders the benefit of the doubt with regard to their shit.

""If the American people are no longer willing to believe this shit, who will?"" Kerry said. ""Somebody's got to take this shit at face value. Otherwise, why are we even doing all this shit in the first place? I am truly saddened by the lack of faith that the citizens of this country are willing to put in my shit, as well as that of my esteemed colleagues. We must repair our society's fraying trust in the shit of our elected officials, or you would not believe the kind of hardcore, heavy-duty shit that will come down.""

""America,"" conservative author and social critic Patricia Stouffer said, ""is seriously losing its shit. But we've got to somehow hold our shit in place until all this passes. We've got to learn to believe in shit again. After this latest shitstorm, it may take years to accomplish, but we must somehow find the strength to put our trust back into the nation's shit.""

Despite such impassioned calls for faith in the U.S. political system and all the shit that comes with it, if the Gallup Poll is any indication, the majority of Americans are no longer willing to put up with the shit.

1,McDonald's Drops 'Hammurderer' Character From Advertising,https://www.theonion.com/mcdonalds-drops-hammurderer-character-from-advertising-1819566355,"OAK BROOK, IL—Bowing to outcry from consumers and parents groups, the McDonald’s Corporation announced Monday that it is discontinuing its new advertising mascot, “The Hammurderer,” a mischievous, homicidal imp who kills McDonaldland characters and takes their sandwiches.

The discontinued character.

Advertisement

Developed by Chicago advertising agency DDB Needham, the Hammurderer made his debut two months ago and has since appeared in a series of Saturday-morning television commercials, as well as on Happy Meal bags and activity placemats. All appearances by and references to the violent, ill-tempered prison escapee will be dropped.

“Over the years, McDonald’s has successfully introduced a number of new characters whose defining characteristic is a certain measure of comical, criminal intent,” said Andrew Perlich, McDonald’s vice-president of promotions. “Such shady characters as The Hamburglar, The Goblins, and the bloodthirsty pirate Captain Crook have all fit nicely into the McDonald’s advertising universe. We had every reason to believe that the Hammurderer, with his long rap sheet of burger-related crimes and his signature cry of ‘Stabble Stabble Stabble,’ would take his place in this proud lineage of McDonaldland mischief-makers.”

The Hammurderer’s Jan. 11 debut ad—in which he seizes and devours the McDonald’s Happy Meal Guys, oblivious to their frantic screams—earned poor marks from parents and child-development experts, who feared the spot might send the message to children that killing is acceptable. Several weeks later, more controversy erupted over the promotional coloring book “Shivved In The McRibs,” in which the Hammurderer decapitates Mayor McCheese and eats his head. Responding to widespread public outrage, McDonald’s executives defended the coloring book as “not nearly as violent or socially irresponsible as it has been made out to be, given that the Mayor’s head is, in fact, a giant and conceivably edible cheeseburger.”

But the uproar over the latest commercial, in which Birdie The Early Bird is garroted by the Hammurderer and her body tossed in a Dumpster, was vociferous enough to prompt the fast-food giant to pull the plug.

“We are sensitive to the concerns of parents and will immediately begin phasing out this character,” Perlich said. “Whether we will remove him from commercials without explanation or write him out of the spots with a bloody police standoff, we have yet to decide. But we’re confident the Hammurderer will be off the national radar by April.”

Hammurderer toys and promotional items, which include dolls, T-shirts, ski masks, and spiked bats, have been recalled and are expected to become prized collectibles.

This is not the first time a McDonald’s character has stirred controversy for its violent nature. In 1982, the company introduced “Shakes McJunkie,” an emaciated addict who robbed characters of their possessions, which he then sold to buy McDonald’s shakes. He was later reworked as “The Machead,” a homeless, wild-eyed Big Mac addict who turned to panhandling and gay prostitution as a means of supporting his severe burger habit.

The Hammurderer is quickly becoming regarded as the worst-received advertising mascot since Kool-Aid’s 1989 discontinuation of “The Grapist,” a huge purple monster who sodomizes thirsty children.",503,3343,6,57

How naive do you think I am? And I guarantee you that the recollections I do have of storming the Capitol are because Bill Gates used one of his 5G satellites to pump fake memories into my brain.” Keleher also reportedly told investigators that if he had been at the Capitol, he would have assuredly been there as part of some false-flag operation, in which case there was no question in his mind that he was secretly an FBI operative.

It is simply impermissible. Going forward, Apple should be required to provide federal agents with a way to get past all this shrink wrap on their own, as well as some guidance as to whether this button here is for turning the phone on or what, exactly?” At press time, sources confirmed Apple had defied the bureau’s demands, claiming that each iPhone’s packaging had to remain intact to prevent a massive breach of user privacy.

The inmate experiences only mild discomfort for a few short seconds while the pressure creates pockets of air under their skin—unless of course the executioner is using a hand pump, in which case it may be a few minutes before the prisoner is sufficiently inflated enough to rupture.” Federal officials added that despite the potential risks, it was a much more merciful method than lethal implosion.

They are only deployed when an officer feels like they are in imminent danger. Sure, in some cases, poorly aimed tires have caused internal bleeding, fractured bones, or left bruises shaped like tread marks over various body parts, but overall, this bouncy, flexible alternative is far preferable to being run over with hard metal wheels. Believe me, if these were intended to cause serious harm, you would know it.” Monahan later refused to address claims by manufacturers that rubber tires are only less lethal when aimed at the ground rather than directly at protestors.

1,Archaeological Dig uncovers Ancient Race of Skeleton People,https://www.theonion.com/archaeological-dig-uncovers-ancient-race-of-skeleton-pe-1819565415,"AL JIZAH, EGYPT—A team of British and Egyptian archaeologists made a stunning discovery Monday, unearthing several intact specimens of “skeleton people”—skinless, organless humans who populated the Nile delta region an estimated 6,000 years ago.

An archaeologist examines the intact remains of a spooky “skeleton person.”

Advertisement

“This is an incredible find,” said Dr. Christian Hutchins, Oxford University archaeologist and head of the dig team. “Imagine: At one time, this entire area was filled with spooky, bony, walking skeletons.”

“The implications are staggering,” Hutchins continued. “We now know that the skeletons we see in horror films and on Halloween are not mere products of the imagination, but actually lived on Earth.”

Standing at the excavation site, a 20-by-20-foot square pit along the Nile River, Hutchins noted key elements of the find. “The skeletons lived in this mud-brick structure, which, based on what we know of these people, was probably haunted,” he said. “Although we found crude cooking utensils in the area, as well as evidence of crafts like pottery and weaving, we are inclined to believe that the skeletons’ chief activity was jumping out at nearby humans and scaring them. And though we know little of their language and means of communication, it is likely that they said ‘boogedy-boogedy’ a lot.”

Approximately 200 yards west of the excavation site, the archaeologists also found evidence of farming.

“What’s puzzling about this,” Cambridge University archaeologist Sir Ian Edmund-White said, “is that skeletons would not benefit from harvested crops, as any food taken orally would immediately fall through the hole behind the jaw and down through the rib cage, eventually hitting the ground. Our best guess is that they scared away a group of human farmers, then remained behind to haunt the dwelling. Or perhaps they bartered goods in a nearby city to acquire skeleton accessories, such as chains, coffins and tattered, dirty clothing.”

Continued Edmund-White: “The hole in that theory, however, is that a 1997 excavation of this area which yielded extensive records of local clans and merchants made no mention of even one animated mass of bones coming to town for the purpose of trade. But we are taking great pains to recover as much of the site as possible, while also being extremely careful not to fall victim to some kind of spooky skeleton curse.”

As for what led to the extinction of the skeletons, Edmund-White offered a theory.

“Perhaps an Egyptian priest or king broke the curse of the skeletons, either by defeating the head skeleton in combat or by discovering the magic words needed to send their spirits back to Hell,” Edmund-White said. “In any case, there is strong evidence that the Power of Greyskull played a significant role in the defeat of the skeleton people.”

According to Hutchins, the skeletons bear numerous similarities to humans, leading him to suspect that there may be an evolutionary link between the two species.

“Like humans, these creatures walked upright on two legs and possessed highly developed opposable thumbs,” Edmund-White said. “These and many other similarities lend credence to the theory that hundreds of thousands of years ago, human development passed through a skeletal stage. These skeletons may, in fact, be ancestors of us all.”

“Any of us could be part skeleton,” he added.

Other experts disagreed.

“The evidence of an evolutionary link between humans and skeletons is sparse at best,” said Dr. Terrance Schneider of the University of Chicago. “Furthermore, it is downright unscientific to theorize that skeleton life originated in Egypt merely because mummies, another species of monster, are indigenous to the area. Spooky creatures are found all over the world, from the vampires of Transylvania to the headless horsemen of Sleepy Hollow.”",627,3979,8,59

""I had to do something to force myself away from the TV,"" said Pearson, 33, carefully laying rows of strawberry slices on the white-fudge-frosting-covered cake. ""All of those people. Those poor people. I don't know what else to do.""

Pearson, who had never before expressed feelings of patriotism in cake form, attributed the baking project to a loss of direction. Having already donated blood, mailed a check to the Red Cross, and sent a letter of thanks to the New York Fire Department, Pearson was aimlessly wandering from room to room in her apartment when the idea of creating the confectionery stars and stripes came to her.

""My friends Cassie and Patrick [Overstreet] invited me over to have dinner and just talk about, you know, everything,"" said Pearson, a Topeka legal secretary who has never visited and knows no one in either New York or Washington, D.C. ""I thought I'd make something special or do something out of respect for all of the people who died. All those innocent people. All those rescue workers who lost their lives.""

Mixing the cake and placing it in the oven shortly after 3 p.m., Pearson sat at the kitchen table and stared at the oven door until the timer rang 50 minutes later.

As the cake cooled, Pearson gathered materials to decorate it. She searched the spice cupboard for a half-used tube of blue food coloring, but could not find it. After frantically pulling all the cans and jars from the cupboard, she finally found the tube in the very back. Emitting a deep sigh of relief, she spread the coloring over the cake's upper-left-hand corner to create the flag's blue field.

""I baked a cake,"" said Pearson, shrugging her shoulders and forcing a smile as she unveiled the dessert in the Overstreet household later that evening. ""I made it into a flag.""

Pearson and the Overstreets stared at the cake in silence for nearly a minute, until Cassie hugged Pearson.

Bush asserts that the fight for freedom in Iraq is a blast.

""On Sept. 11, 2001, we as a nation faced a difficult decision, an important decision, a decision between what was fun and what was wrong,"" Bush said during a speech before Pentagon officials Wednesday. ""We could have backed down and allowed the terrorists to win. But instead, we stood up to the challenge before us, and we said, 'Bring it on—bring the good times on!'""

""Mark my words,"" Bush continued. ""When the dust settles and the smoke clears, history will look back on the Iraq War as a total blast.""

Throughout his speech, Bush remained unapologetic about his commitment to the ongoing mission to live it up in Iraq, repeatedly saying that sacrifices had to be made to ensure the most pleasurable course of action. The president also stated that he would not succumb to those who had pressured him to set a date for withdrawal, insisting that U.S. troops would remain in the region for as long as his administration was enjoying itself.

""Withdrawing from Iraq when we're all having such a fantastic time would only serve to empower those intent on spoiling our fun,"" Bush said. ""And I have to say, right now, we're having a ball.""

Bush went on to defend his decision to remove troops from Afghanistan and ""bring the party"" to Iraq. He maintained that while policing the region wasn't ""a bore or anything"" it wasn't all that entertaining, either. Furthermore, the president said that had the United States not shifted its focus away from Afghanistan, military forces never would have had the opportunity to kick up their heels in Iraqi cities such as Basra, Baghdad, and Tikrit.

""Tell me 'Shock and Awe' wasn't an absolute riot,"" a visibly confident Bush said.

Bush maintained that he had no regrets about invading Iraq, and that all he needed to do to know he made the right decision was look at the smiling, happy faces of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Vice President Dick Cheney, and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.

Following the president's speech, Rice herself lashed out against critics of the war, painting them as ""real downers"" who wouldn't know how to let their hair down and have fun if their lives depended on it.

""I urge those who have grown tired of this war to lighten up and live a little,"" Rice said on CBS Evening News, adding that Bush had furthered his commitment to having a rip-roaring time in Iraq with a recent troop surge. ""What detractors of this war don't understand is that when it comes to fighting terrorism, there's no harm in letting loose and painting the town red.""

While Rice admitted that the Bush Administration could have better planned its exit strategy and more fully equipped troops to deal with the Sunni insurgency, she questioned how much fun that ultimately would have been for U.S. troops.

""The best times are had when there's no preparation in place. When everything is loud and spontaneous and you just throw caution to the wind,"" Rice said. ""Sure, we might have been able to prevent a massive civil war had we taken a few precautions—but come on, where's the joy in that?""

Bush, who claimed he could see America having a great time in Iraq for decades to come, and called the war in the Middle East the most fun the nation has had since Vietnam, agreed with Rice.

1,"Bitter Feud Developing Between Joakim Noah, Rest Of Humanity",https://sports.theonion.com/bitter-feud-developing-between-joakim-noah-rest-of-hum-1819574981,"MIAMI—As the Chicago Bulls prepare to face the Miami Heat in what is a must-win playoff elimination game for Chicago, sources around the world confirmed Wednesday that a bitter feud is rapidly building up between Bulls center Joakim Noah and the rest of the human race.

Advertisement

The growing resentment that reportedly developed in recent years between Noah and every other man, woman, and child living on the earth has swelled into a full-blown acrimony, according to the impassioned testimonials from irate individuals on all seven continents.

“There’s always been bad blood between Joakim Noah and those other 7 billion people,” said Cleveland resident and Cavaliers fan Javier Batista, adding that something about the Chicago post player has always rubbed him and every other human being the wrong way. “On one side, you’ve got this cocky loudmouth whose entire game consists of snatching rebounds, and on the other you’ve got the totality of human life besides Noah who just want to see him fall flat on his ugly face, so, yeah, you can see how there would be some tension.”

“God, I fucking hate him,” continued Batista, who is a target of intense dislike from the NBA All-Star.

According to reports, the simmering hostilities between Noah and the rest of mankind date back to the athlete’s tenure with the University of Florida basketball program beginning in 2004, when the 6’11” center started nurturing a series of vitriolic rivalries with players on opposing teams and their fans. The blistering enmity, 7 billion sources confirmed, quickly spread throughout the human population.

Today, this mutual antagonism encompasses the Bulls star’s tumultuous back-and-forth with referees, sports pundits, and Chicago Bulls fans, all of whom despise Noah, and who in turn are despised by him.

Additionally, sources confirmed that the reciprocated animosity extends to Noah’s relationship with each and every other segment of humanity, including Zen Buddhists, Europe, newborn babies, and the Guajá tribespeople of Brazil, who, despite having extremely limited contact with the outside world, maintain a bright, burning hatred for the Bulls center that is returned by Noah every time he struts out onto the court.

“Yeah, Joakim and all other people have always had it in for each other, but you can definitely see it start to bubble over lately,” said Bulls head coach Tom Thibodeau, emphasizing the difficulty in managing an infuriating individual with whom he has exchanged heated words and physical threats on a daily basis.“The way he talks trash every second he’s on the court and beats his chest after making easy tip-ins—and especially that shifty little smirk of his—well, honestly, I’m surprised the world’s peoples haven’t yet stormed the floor and torn him limb from limb.”

“That piece of shit,” added Thibodeau, echoing the feelings of literally everyone on the planet except for Noah himself.

However, such sentiment hasn’t yet fazed the two-time NCAA Championship winner, who, when reached for comment, said he wasn’t going to allow his ongoing feud with the human race to affect his game.

“I tune out all that stuff,” said Noah while staring down the reporter of this article, who even now is seething with rage just thinking about the lanky motherfucker bitching to the refs about a no-call. “Right now, I’m focused on playing good ball and getting a ring, no matter what my teammates, David Stern, various world leaders, the Screen Actors Guild, coma patients, Joni Mitchell, my childhood kindergarten teacher, you, and my parents might think of me. And if any of those billions of people feel like talking shit, they can do it while I’m on my way to the basket.”

The vice president assures Ambassador Reinart that ""there's plenty of good skin mags up there.""

""So, you ready to see this sweet-ass roof or what?"" the vice president was overheard telling Reinart, one of several foreign dignitaries who visited the White House this weekend. ""Come on, it'll be a lot of fun. It's a killer spot to just chill out. Everyone thinks this place is all about the Oval Office, but I guarantee the best seat in the house is right up top.""

Advertisement

""Real beaut of a view, too,"" Biden added as he threw an arm around the 48-year-old diplomat. ""You can see tons of shit. Be a damn shame if you didn't at least take a gander.""

Sources confirmed Biden invited Reinart to go up to the roof on at least a dozen separate occasions during his three-hour White House visit, telling the ambassador that he'd ""have a blast"" and that ""Diamond Joe"" would never steer him wrong.

Reinart told reporters the vice president repeatedly said the roof would ""totally kick ass,"" while a tour of countless bedrooms filled with boring antique furniture would ""seriously blow.""

Despite Reinart's polite assertions that he had a busy itinerary with a visiting Estonian delegation and senior White House officials, Biden insisted the two of them should ""lose the suits"" and cruise up to the roof where they could unwind with a couple of brews.

""Fuck it—let's go up,"" said Biden, who opened a Coors tallboy and handed the overflowing can to the ambassador, ignoring his gentle protests. ""I'll get the grill going, and we can just throw whatever we want on there. I got some sweet lawn chairs, a cooler, even some fireworks. I usually do my own Fourth of July thing up there.""

""Just gotta snag my tuneage,"" Biden added while retrieving a boom-box stereo and a handful of cassette tapes from a vacant office. ""I'll bring the binocs, too. Never know when a few topless chicks with balconies might be out catching some rays.""

Advertisement

As he explained that going to the top of the White House was ""the only way to truly fucking experience D.C.,"" Biden said the one rule when they got on the roof was that they definitely couldn't throw beer bottles over the side of the building anymore.

Biden, whom Secret Service officials confirmed is not permitted to be on the roof, then reportedly removed a small bag of marijuana from his pocket and explained to Reinart that he was running low but still had enough to roll a pinner joint.

Although the ambassador reminded Biden they were expected to attend a state dinner that night, the vice president assured Reinart it would be ""way cooler to get blazed"" beforehand, as doing so makes the food at official White House events taste much better.

""I've spent a lot of time on this roof,"" Biden said. ""Even slept up there once and it rained on me. By the way, if you're thirsty, don't drink anything from those Gatorade bottles.""

Advertisement

In the past, Biden has reportedly taken numerous guests up to the White House roof, including, on one occasion, Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi and German chancellor Angela Merkel, a visit Biden described as ""pretty hot and heavy.""

Also, after the Earth has been cut in half, we at ExxonMobil fully intend to stick it back together.” At press time, ExxonMobil was under fire for reportedly spilling all 2.1 trillion gallons of untapped oil outer space.

1,Sociologist Considers Own Behavior Indicative Of Larger Trends,https://www.theonion.com/sociologist-considers-own-behavior-indicative-of-larger-1819565923,"BOSTON–According to the findings of a paper published Monday in The American Journal Of Sociology, the behaviors and experiences of Boston sociologist Dr. Stephen Piers are indicative of a host of wider societal trends.

Sociologist Dr. Stephen Piers.

Advertisement

""My observations indicate that the typical married American man has had increasing difficulty relating to his spouse over the last two and a half years, ever since she started taking those yoga classes,"" wrote Piers, 56, in his Interpersonal Connections Within The Marriage Paradigm: A Study In Causality.

In the paper, Piers asserted that the most pressing issue for American men is maintaining healthy sexual relations with their wives.

Advertisement

""Back in 1999, American men's frustration derived mostly from the infrequency of sex,"" the paper read. ""Recently, however, that trend has shifted as husbands report a decreasing interest in intimacy, particularly if there is a Celtics game or a new NYPD Blue on TV. While many men cite increased job responsibilities and stress as possible catalysts, many more blame the affair their wives had a year ago with some textile salesman during a training conference in Seattle.""

Though the paper originally focused on U.S. couples' growing intimacy problems, Piers was compelled to write about other issues, as well.

""Often, wives' repeated verbal requests, or 'nagging,' aggravate their husbands so much that they choose to spend every evening in their basements, listening to Miles Davis records and polishing their model train collections,"" he wrote. ""Many often report muttering 'castrating bitch' when listening to her shrill voice from upstairs.""

Though Piers is well respected within the sociology community, some colleagues charge that his paper breaks no new ground.

Advertisement

""On page 73, Piers reports that 'the married American male can no longer stand his wife's hyena-like laugh,'"" said Boston University sociology professor Dr. Theodore Muncie. ""I don't know if Piers keeps up on the literature, but I reported that trend almost three years ago. By the time Piers released his findings, the American husband's general attitude toward the laugh had long passed into the stage known as 'icy acceptance.'""

Continued Muncie: ""Piers also reports that American men seem to enjoy an after-dinner, single-malt scotch for the purpose of relaxation. Yet, as almost any reputable sociologist will tell you, that is inaccurate. The prevailing trend is to enjoy a glass of Merlot or possibly cognac, and it has been ever since upper-class U.S. males finished grad school.""

Piers' 1974 paper, Domestic Situationality: The Fortunate Male In American Society, was hailed as a landmark work almost immediately upon publication. Published one month after Piers' wedding to college sweetheart Angela Beckman, Domestic Situationality reported that American males were ""blissfully happy, despite lacking the freedom of single life."" However, in his 2000 paper, U.S. Wives: Lying, Cheating Whores? he found an enormous upswing in infidelity among American middle-aged wives and a parallel rise in the risk of fiery death among single male textile salesmen from Seattle.

""When that report came out, everyone told me I was imagining things, that it was all in my head,"" Piers said. ""But the evidence was clearly there for American men–the late nights, the secret phone calls, the way American wives seemed to be getting a lot more dressed up every time they left the house. All I can say is my wife Angela sure was upset when that report was released.""

Piers added that the average American male is unsure whether to get a chicken-parmesan sub at Luigi's Pizza or shrimp lo mein at Hunan Garden when they go to lunch in the next 45 minutes or so. He said that his paper on the subject, Gustatory Cognitive Dissonance In The American Male: 12 p.m. To 1 p.m., will be published later this afternoon.",625,3950,8,62

But then you do think about that, and then you realize it’s pretty pitiful that what blacks are going through right now in America could be considered a veritable heyday.” The study went on to point out that, on an optimistic note, at least black people aren’t worse off in 2013 than the nation’s women, who are just as fucked now as they’ve ever been.",240,1420,12,63

""What America needs right now is not more talk and long-term strategy, but a concrete way to create more imaginary wealth in the very immediate future,"" said Thomas Jenkins, CFO of the Boston-area Jenkins Financial Group, a bubble-based investment firm. ""We are in a crisis, and that crisis demands an unviable short-term solution.""

A prominent finance expert asks Congress to help Americans rebuild their ficticious dreams.

The current economic woes, brought on by the collapse of the so-called ""housing bubble,"" are considered the worst to hit investors since the equally untenable dot-com bubble burst in 2001. According to investment experts, now that the option of making millions of dollars in a short time with imaginary profits from bad real-estate deals has disappeared, the need for another spontaneous make-believe source of wealth has never been more urgent.

""Perhaps the new bubble could have something to do with watching movies on cell phones,"" said investment banker Greg Carlisle of the New York firm Carlisle, Shaloe & Graves. ""Or, say, medicine, or shipping. Or clouds. The manner of bubble isn't important—just as long as it creates a hugely overvalued market based on nothing more than whimsical fantasy and saddled with the potential for a long-term accrual of debts that will never be paid back, thereby unleashing a ripple effect that will take nearly a decade to correct.""

""The U.S. economy cannot survive on sound investments alone,"" Carlisle added.

Congress is currently considering an emergency economic-stimulus measure, tentatively called the Bubble Act, which would order the Federal Reserve to† begin encouraging massive private investment in some fantastical financial scheme in order to get the nation's false economy back on track.

Advertisement

Current bubbles being considered include the handheld electronics bubble, the undersea-mining-rights bubble, and the decorative office-plant bubble. Additional options include speculative trading in fairy dust—which lobbyists point out has the advantage of being an entirely imaginary commodity to begin with—and a bubble based around a hypothetical, to-be-determined product called ""widgets.""

The most support thus far has gone toward the so-called paper bubble. In this appealing scenario, various privately issued pieces of paper, backed by government tax incentives but entirely worthless, would temporarily be given grossly inflated artificial values and sold to unsuspecting stockholders by greedy and unscrupulous entrepreneurs.

Advertisement

""Little pieces of paper are the next big thing,"" speculator Joanna Nadir, of Falls Church, VA said. ""Just keep telling yourself that. If enough people can be talked into thinking it's legitimate, it will become temporarily true.""

Demand for a new investment bubble began months ago, when the subprime mortgage bubble burst and left the business world without a suitable source of pretend income. But as more and more time has passed with no substitute bubble forthcoming, investors have begun to fear that the worst-case scenario—an outcome known among economists as ""real-world repercussions""—may be inevitable.

Advertisement

""Every American family deserves a false sense of security,"" said Chris Reppto, a risk analyst for Citigroup in New York. ""Once we have a bubble to provide a fragile foundation, we can begin building pyramid scheme on top of pyramid scheme, and before we know it, the financial situation will return to normal.""

Despite the overwhelming support for a new bubble among investors, some in Washington are critical of the idea, calling continued reliance on bubble-based economics a mistake. Regardless of the outcome of this week's congressional hearings, however, one thing will remain certain: The calls for a new bubble are only going to get louder.

Xbox fanboys, looks like your dreams of getting an up-close-and-personal look at the Chief are finally being fulfilled—and his dental hygiene is more upsetting than anyone could have ever predicted.



Ever since we stepped foot into the legendary Spartan’s MJOLNIR armor way back in 2001 with Halo: Combat Evolved, the single-player campaigns have always left us with the same tantalizing question: What was going on inside that helmet? Well, with this sneak peek at the yellowed, cavity-ridden teeth inside of Master Chief’s mouth, we’re finally getting an answer, albeit a viscerally disturbing one that none of us specifically requested.



Of course, there is a distinct satisfaction to looking over the Chief’s gingivitis-plagued gum line and impacted molars and realizing this is the Spartan who saved the human race from the Covenant. But as rewarding as it is for fans to finally take a gander at the pieces of decayed meat caught up in his bleeding gums and crooked teeth, all of this just raises more tantalizing questions: “Doesn’t Master Chief ever brush his teeth?”; “Has he considered braces for those repulsive things?”; and “Isn’t he bothered by his apparently severe halitosis while he’s cooped up inside that metal suit?”

At the very least, this answers how the hero known as John-117 managed to avoid seeing a dentist even once as he fought countless battles against the Flood, as well as giving gamers a great reminder of how important regular visits with their dental hygienists are. Plus, getting this close to the Chief’s mouth—no matter how repulsive—just makes us more excited than ever to get our hands on Halo: Infinite! Here’s hoping it’s worth the wait.



Until then, stay tuned to OGE for all the game reveals you could ever want.

1,Third Amendment Rights Group Celebrates Another Successful Year,https://www.theonion.com/third-amendment-rights-group-celebrates-another-success-1819569379,"WASHINGTON, DC—The National Anti- Quartering Association, America's foremost Third Amendment rights group, held its annual gala in Washington Monday to honor 191 consecutive years of advocating the protection of private homes and property against the unlawful boarding of military personnel.

Advertisement

""This is a proud day for quarters-owners everywhere,"" said the organization's president, Charles Davison, in his keynote address. ""Year after year, we have sent a loud and clear message to the federal government and to anyone else who would attack our unassailable rights: Hands off our cottages, livery stables, and haylofts.""

The NAQA was created in 1816 in response to repeated violations of the Third Amendment during the War of 1812. The organization quickly grew in influence and cites its vigilance as the primary reason why the amendment has only been litigated once in a federal court since the Bill of Rights was ratified. The organization is also arguably the country's most powerful political lobby; every politician elected since 1866 has fully supported Third Amendment rights.

""The framers of the Constitution provided the American people with the right to have their homes free of troops unless Congress mandates otherwise during a time of war,"" Davison said. ""Thanks to our tireless efforts, six generations of civilians have never known the cruelty and duress of quartering unruly foot soldiers.""

Davison recalled the ""dark days"" of 1982, when the federal case of Engblom v. Carey threatened to strip Americans of their fundamental Third Amendment freedoms. The ruling by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals acknowledged that the State of New York had indeed violated the Third Amendment rights of the plaintiffs. The case, according to Davison, was ""a chilling reminder of how even an established 200-year-old right hangs by a slender thread.""

""I don't think people fully understand how close we came to completely losing such a basic right,"" Davison said. ""If the Second Circuit had ruled otherwise, we'd be living in a world in which soldiers would be quartering amok upon our very hearthstones.""

Davison expressed pride in the NAQA's grassroots involvement at the local level, citing the association's direct-mailing campaigns and its fully staffed regional centers where citizens can report Third Amendment rights abuses. The NAQA also holds quartering-safety seminars for citizens interested in learning how to effectively defend their households against U.S. troops seeking shelter.

Davison reiterated the organization's promise to oppose pro-quartering legislation should any ever be proposed.

""Keep the fat hands of soldiers out of America's larders!"" Davison said to rousing applause. He was quoting the NAQA's familiar slogan, which can be found on T-shirts, bumper stickers, and other merchandise sold on the group's website.

Davison ended his address by warning of the dangers of the NAQA resting on its laurels.

""Pro-quartering advocates are waiting for just the right moment to stick a bunch of troops in our homes,"" Davison said. ""Well, I say to them that we will never allow this to happen. You can count on the true patriots of the NAQA to ensure that no chickens and livestock will be appropriated, and private stores of salt, brandy, candles, and vinegar will stay firmly where they belong: in civilian hands.""

The NAQA is known for its quick and aggressive mobilization when it believes Third Amendment rights are at risk, and has rushed to the defense of homeowners it believes are being illegally coerced into housing American soldiers. Last month, 200 NAQA members marched on a private residence in Fairfax, VA after receiving a tip that the owners were being victimized by three Navy seamen demanding prolonged quartering. They ended their demonstration, however, when it was discovered that the sailors were brothers on shore leave visiting their parents.

Davison, 49, has headed the NAQA since January, replacing longtime president Lawrence Frost. Frost, 58, left the organization to chair the Citizens Committee for the Right to Drink, a 21st Amendment rights group committed to the continued legal status of alcohol for Americans of drinking age.",661,4257,8,63

While this was, technically, a lethal action on the sovereign territory of another nation, it was really more about sending a message. It’s like when Obama did it, okay? Look, I don’t blame you for being concerned, but you seriously shouldn’t sweat it.” According to Randall, the strike was undoubtedly part of a broader Middle East policy designed to ensure the United States would not have to continue intervening in the region for years on end.

1,Eloquent Biden Brings Entire Audience To Tears In Debate Stunner,https://politics.theonion.com/eloquent-biden-brings-entire-audience-to-tears-in-debat-1819574033,"'I'm A Flawed Man, But There Is Love In My Heart' Vice President Says

Advertisement

DANVILLE, KY—In what observers called a stunning and unexpected display of oratorical eloquence and candor, Vice President Joe Biden delivered a deeply articulate and heartfelt speech at the conclusion of Thursday night’s vice presidential debate, reportedly moving the entire audience at Centre College to tears.

After moderator Martha Raddatz asked Biden to give his closing statements, the former senator stared down at his prepared statement for several moments before setting it aside, standing on top of the table in front of him, and sharing a series of frank, poignant personal reflections as a surprised and reverent hush fell across the auditorium.

“I know people expect me to embarrass myself right now, or to do something reckless or silly, but I’m not going to do that—not tonight,” said Biden, his voice suddenly tinged with what observers described as a degree of warmth and tender regret never before heard from the veteran politician. “I know how you people see me—the fast cars, the hitchhiking, the trips to Juárez. You know me, ol’ stumbling numbnuts Joe Biden. Right? Well, shit, I’ll be the first to admit that I ain’t no saint. No, sir, I suppose I ain’t much of a role model, either. But when it comes right down to it, even with all my flaws, I am a human being. With hopes, with dreams, and with love in my heart.”

“Go ahead and laugh at Uncle Joe, or call him a fool if you like—I’m not going to stop ya,” Biden continued. “But know that I have a soul, and that my soul bleeds. Hell, I may not always know which way I’m going, or why, but god damn it if I’m not trying the best I can. The everloving best I can.”

Biden then reportedly paused, pulled a carton of cigarettes and a Zippo lighter from his back pocket, lit a cigarette, took a few puffs, and stared silently at the ceiling before once again addressing the audience.

“Listen, I know I’m the last person in the world to give you all a lecture on morality,” said Biden pacing the tabletop as the auditorium lights laid bare every world-weary crease and crevice in his 69-year-old face. “I’ve sure as shit made my fair share of mistakes. I’ve ridden through some pretty dicey places in my Trans-Am, had one or two run-ins with the law, and spent more than a few nights in county. I’ve done things…terrible things. I’ve got a list of regrets a mile wide, and there are nights when those regrets frankly tear me up inside. Just tear me right up.”

“But despite all this, I still have my dignity,” Biden added. “And nobody can take that away from me, no matter what. It’s what keeps me human. It’s what keeps me alive.”

Sources confirmed the Obama campaign was completely taken aback by the vice president’s sudden departure from the expected debate rhetoric, having reportedly instructed Biden to “stick to the issues” and refrain from going off-topic. However, many staffers were said to be incredibly moved by the sincerity of Biden’s words, with senior campaign adviser Robert Gibbs calling it “a revelation” and “a glimpse into the bruised soul of a man who’s lived 10 lifetimes.”

While acknowledging the ongoing criticism of Obama over the past week, a misty-eyed Biden offered an honest and personal account of his running mate while arguing for voters to give the president a second term.

“We’ve been through some crazy times, me and Barry,” said Biden, taking a quick swig from a flask he pulled from the inside pocket of his leather jacket. “He’s caught me on his roof doing some stuff I probably shouldn’t have been doing. Stuff I’m not proud of, despite how cocky I might act. But you know what? I trust him. And he trusts me. I don’t want to make some big political speech up here, but I will tell you right now that Barry’s the guy to lead us. He’s a good fuckin’ man. What’s more, he’s my dear friend. And I love him.”

Sources present at the debate claimed Biden became especially emotional in the middle of his speech when he spotted his wife of 35 years, Jill, in the audience.

“Jesus, Jilly…my beautiful, beautiful Jilly,” said Biden, turning to speak directly to his wife. “Darlin’, I know I haven’t been the perfect husband. Shit, far from it. I’ve done some things with other women that have really put you in a tough spot. But you gotta believe me when I say that I never, ever meant to hurt you.”

Advertisement

“I love you with all my heart, Jilly,” added Biden, who maintained a stoic expression as his eyes welled with tears. “I always have, and I always will.”

Wiping his eyes, Biden finally made a heartfelt appeal to Americans to try, “if they could,” to see “the real Joe.”

“My name is Joseph Robinette Biden Jr.,” said the vice president, his voice choking. “Over the years I have been made an object of mockery and ridicule. I have seen pictures of me in the most humiliating positions you can think of plastered across newspapers all over the world. I have been treated as a punch line. A dope. A fuckin’ jester among kings. But don’t be fooled. I am also a man who has touched sorrow. And I am a son of a bitch who has spent nearly seven decades on the razor’s edge and lived to tell the tale. I may not say it often, and I may never say it again, but I wish to say to you now that I am also a man worthy of love. And worthy of respect.”

“Thank you all so damn much,” Biden added. “I just…I love this country, man.”

Wiping his eyes, Biden then descended from the table and sat back down as the tearful and blindsided audience attempted to make sense of what they had just witnessed.

After nearly a full minute of deeply moving silence, Biden then whistled loudly and admitted to the assembled crowd that he had “a huge fuckin’ woody right now.”",1040,5837,10,64

In fact, to focus our full attention on this effort, we’re also shelving all other legislative plans until summer to devote our full attention to this impeachment effort: No stimulus. No infrastructure. President Trump must go.” Reached for comment, Sen.

WASHINGTON—According to a new report released Monday by a panel of top economists and social scientists, the People's Republic of China will overtake the United States as the world's dominant asshole by the year 2020.

Advertisement

The findings, published in the most recent issue of Foreign Affairs, support recent speculation that America's unquestioned reign as the leading super-prick may soon be drawing to a close, leaving China as the foremost shithead among all developed nations.

""We are seeing a changing of the asshole guard,"" said Andrew Freireich, noted economist and lead author of the article. ""Although the U.S. will remain among the world's two or three biggest cocks through much of this century, we can now confidently project that China, with its soaring economic growth, ever-expanding cultural influence, and total disregard for basic human rights, will overtake America as King Prick Numero Uno within the next 10 years.""

Added Freireich, ""It's the dawning of a new huge bastard era.""

According to the report, China has slowly emerged as a massive fucker over the past half century, a period of egotistical growth unseen since America's booming douche years following World War II.

According to estimates, China already has a slight lead on the U.S. in not giving a fuck about climate change.

Over that same time, China has seen a dramatic rise in both its GDP and Shithead Index, definite signs that the Asian nation is developing into a cocksucker of global proportions.

Advertisement

""When you consider China's wanton pollution, rising militarism, and rampant overdevelopment, it's clear they'll soon be thoroughly out-dicking the U.S. in every measurable area,"" international affairs specialist Neil Farren said. ""Not many Americans want to admit it, but as the yuan continues to get stronger, and millions upon millions are exploited as a result, more and more people worldwide will be looking to China, not America, and saying, 'Man, can you believe what an unbelievable sack of shit that country is?'""

China's ascension to supreme asshole status is occurring at a much faster pace than experts originally predicted. In fact, many now believe that by as early as 2015 Chinese citizens will arrogantly strut across the globe disrespecting other cultures and shouting loudly while dressed in XXL ""Speak Chinese or Go Home"" T-shirts.

Advertisement

Prominent scholars claim that America's gradual fall from the upper echelon of international supershits is merely part of an inevitable pattern seen time and again throughout world history.

""All of the great asshole nations eventually watch their day in the sun slip away,"" historian Richard Merriam told reporters. ""Don't forget that Great Britain was the world's dominant asshole for well over three centuries, and look at it now: a pussy-whipped shell of the insufferable, bullying jackass it used to be.""

Advertisement

Others have posited that China's ascension may be part of a larger reorganization of the global asshole hegemony that could see the United States losing even more ground in the century to come.

""A country like Iran is obviously a pretty big dick, but ultimately it lacks the resources to be a truly world-class asshole,"" Farran said. ""Same goes for Pakistan. But the list of abominable shit-heel countries competing for global prick dominance is a long one, and the U.S. is just going to have to get used to seeing countries like Russia and India mentioned in the same breath as itself.""

Advertisement

""Many Americans are going to be upset over the prospect of falling from that top spot, but that's the reality we face,"" Farrar continued. ""Hopefully, the United States will find a way to grow and adjust to its evolving role on the world stage without acting like a complete and utter fuckhead about it.""",623,3883,11,65

As an elected official, you have to be so careful about what metaphors you use to describe black people. The mainstream media loves to blow everything you say about the merits of white nationalism out of proportion.

Ingesting small amounts of consecrated substances have worked wonders for my piousness. I mean, just yesterday I blessed, like, 500 parishioners and I wasn’t tired at all.” At press time, a completely nude Pope Francis, who had accidentally taken too much E ucharist, stormed into a meeting of cardinals screaming about demons crawling under his skin.

I don’t understand why everyone seems to be so angry lately. Everywhere you look, there are marches, protests, riots—and all of it over so-called racism in our great country. I just don’t get it. I really don’t. But maybe that’s because, when I look at my fellow Americans, I don’t see a particular race or color. In fact, all I see is just a series of muted, roughly person-shaped silhouettes.

Advertisement

And this world would be a much better place if everyone else did, too.

If we want to go forward as a country, we have to move beyond race once and for all. It’s 2014! Why is it so hard for people to look past each other’s race, like I do, and see everyone as vaporous, beige-ish forms with limbs? All those blurry, vaguely human-shaped troublemakers shouting in the streets and the translucent bleeding-heart blobs moralizing on TV may feel the need to categorize everyone they see by their skin color, but I don’t give it a second thought. I wouldn’t even know how!

Advertisement

Take, for example, the recent deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, which sparked widespread outrage over “institutional racism.” These protesters are stuck in the past. They haven’t progressed enough to see that we’re all just grayish-brown smudges between approximately 4 and 6 and a half feet tall. They are part of the problem! Whereas they see “black” victims and “white” police, I just see amorphous clouds of the same basic hue, some of which have guns.

Like Martin Luther King Jr., who spoke for nondescript blotches everywhere, I judge a man not based on the color of his skin, but on the content of his character. And I’ll be the first to admit that the civil rights era was important. It made sure that everyone, no matter what fuzzy, neutral tint their ill-defined, human-like shape happens to be, could enjoy the same liberties as anyone else. But it’s not the 1960s anymore, and the very idea of race is ridiculous now. We have a fuzzy, neutral-tinted president, for crying out loud! Get over it.

I’m not saying this is an easy road to walk. In fact, in many respects, the way I see the world has made my life a living hell. I don’t know who anyone is. I have no way to tell where one person ends and another begins. I’ve been married for 13 years and I honestly do not know what race my husband is, let alone his gender. I assume he is alive, but there’s no actual proof of that. I have no clue what my children look like, or if I have children, or if they are dogs. The universe is a terrifying orchestra of matter and sound not tethered to any discernible reality. I am literally living in horror every moment of my life.

But you don’t see me rioting in the streets about it, do you?

People ask me all the time if I have any black friends, and my answer is, I have no idea. What is black? Are the globs who are good at basketball “black”? Or are the globs who are good at math “black”? Like I said, I don’t see race, because I am not capable of discerning any physical difference between the nebulous tangle of lifesmears that comprise all of humanity. People accuse me—me!—of being racist. I am the least racist person in the world! How can it be racism if all I can see are fleeting wisps of electromagnetic activity and a shimmering aura that represents each person’s individual essence?

If everyone saw things from my perspective, we could finally put this issue of race in the past. Then every hazy, indistinct mass in this country could live in harmony. Except for those awful Spanish-accented humanoid shapes who are taking all our jobs. They need to go.",650,3614,11,67
1,Developmentally Disabled Burger King Employee Only Competent Worker,https://local.theonion.com/developmentally-disabled-burger-king-employee-only-comp-1819565891,"MANCHESTER, NH–Despite his third-grade reading level and IQ of 71, developmentally disabled Burger King employee Andy Ehrman is the only competent member of the 22-person Frontage Road staff.

Advertisement

""I will help you with that!"" the 28-year-old Ehrman told a drive-thru customer Monday, hustling to put the customer's order in a bag after cashier Daniel Genz dropped it on a tray and walked away. ""There you go! Thank you! Have a nice day!""

As Ehrman waved goodbye to the customer, Genz leaned against the shake machine, making a cell-phone call to his girlfriend.

""Don't forget to shut the drawer, Daniel, or someone can take all the money,"" said Ehrman, pushing the register closed and straightening the stack of trays under the counter. ""Then we'd all get in trouble!""

In addition to his usual lunch-rush duties–making sure the dining area, condiment island, and restrooms are clean and stocked–Ehrman spent 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Monday voluntarily sweeping and mopping the floor in the prep area, helping an elderly customer find her purse, and throwing salt on the icy walk outside the restaurant.

During the same two-hour stretch, 20-year-old Jenna Sanders, Ehrman's direct supervisor, incorrectly prepared three orders, spilled a jug of oil in the kitchen, and had a 25-minute conversation about the band Slipknot with coworker Debi Price.

""[Sanders] double-charged me for a BK Big Fish Value Meal,"" customer Terry Unger said. ""Then she got my order completely wrong. I was about to storm out of there and never come back again when this retarded kid, all smiles, comes up and asks if I need help. Sixty seconds later, he hands me the correct order and change, and apologizes for the trouble. Finally, someone who understands how to treat a customer.""

Unger added that in addition to having the only clean uniform in the store, Ehrman seemed to be the sole employee with basic interpersonal skills.

""Maybe they teach it in the special-ed classes or something, but he's the only one who actually speaks in sentences as opposed to grunts,"" Unger said. ""And when I asked for extra ketchup packets, he handed them to me and said, 'Here you go,' instead of rolling his eyes.""

Advertisement

Ehrman is also willing to perform tasks beyond those in his job description, offering to help coworkers stock shelves or run the dishwasher when they fall behind. Most nights, Ehrman even volunteers to clean the grease traps.

""I don't mind,"" Ehrman said. ""I'm helping!""

Willis Barnett, a delivery driver who makes twice-weekly dropoffs at the Frontage Road store, is among the many people impressed with Ehrman.

Employee Randy Leyner (left) sits while Ehrman clears a table.

""I love it when I make a delivery and they've got that tard working in the back,"" Barnett said. ""He always knows exactly where everything goes. Everyone else just says, 'Uh, I don't know–toss it on the floor or something.'""

Advertisement

Among his many other qualities, Ehrman boasts a near-encyclopedic knowledge of Burger King protocol and safety regulations.

""[Assistant manager] Kerri [Sheckley] said the dishwasher uses the green stuff, and [manager] Bob [Hundhausen] said it uses the purple stuff,"" Ehrman said. ""But then I saw on the TV show [training video Cleaning The Burger King Way] that you use both, 'cause one is the stuff that kills germs and one is soap. So I use both.""

Advertisement

Ehrman also makes an effort to bring potential safety hazards to coworkers' attention.

""Hey, Randy, we can't put cardboard boxes or anything paper under there,"" Ehrman told Randy Leyner, 26, upon seeing him put a stack of french-fry cartons under the fryer. ""It could start a fire!"" After being ignored by Leyner, Ehrman dragged the cartons to the rear storage closet himself.

Advertisement

Unlike other members of the Frontage Road team, Ehrman never shows up late or asks to leave early. In fact, when Ehrman works the morning shift, he can usually be seen waiting in the front lobby by 5:30 a.m., 45 minutes before the morning manager arrives to unlock the door.

But despite working substantially harder than any of his coworkers, Ehrman bears no resentment toward them.

Advertisement

""I used to work at the hospital in the mailroom, but it was boring and people were mean to me,"" said Ehrman, plugging his nose and shaking his head to signify that the job ""stank."" ""I like to work at Burger King better. There's always lots and lots to do. And I get a free Whopper to take home!""

Miriam Donnelly, the social worker who placed Ehrman at Burger King, is extremely pleased with his success.

Advertisement

""Andy has trouble with basic addition and spelling his name, but he fits right in at Burger King,"" Donnelly said. ""The work seems almost tailor-made for someone with special needs.""

Donnelly added that everything at Burger King, from the touch-pad registers to the step-by-step diagrams for folding the apple-pie sleeves, is designed to help low-functioning individuals succeed.

""Andy may go a little slower than some of the other workers, but he does one thing at a time, focuses on it, and, in the end, gets it right,"" Donnelly said. ""Actually, now that I think about it, he's not really any slower.""",869,5255,8,67

Biden is just okay. I don’t hate him, I’m just not really thrilled, either. I guess I’ll reluctantly drag my feet to the campaign trail for Joe, but only to get Trump out of office. Whatever. I just want this stupid election to be over.” At press time, Harris added her first choice for the nomination would have been former South Bend, IN mayor Pete Buttigieg.

As pure- blooded as they come. He had no choice. The mob was challenging his worldview and left him with no option but to kill those standing in opposition to his racist ideology. Many are trying to smear him by saying he only acted in self-defense, but the evidence reveals this was a kid who just loved the police state.” At press time, Trump added he only wished Rittenhouse would have managed to shoot more pr otesters.

1,I Get To Determine Whether Gay People Can Marry (by Clarence Thomas),https://www.theonion.com/i-get-to-determine-whether-gay-people-can-marry-1819584799,"Clarence Thomas

Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court

Last week, the Supreme Court decided to take up a pair of cases related to gay marriage, cases that will for the first time determine the constitutionality of laws denying marriage rights to same-sex couples. As a member of the nation’s highest court for the past 21 years, I can remember few rulings of such consequence as these two, which will affect the lives of so many people. So as the time approaches, I ask all Americans to think long and hard on what these decisions will mean for the future of our nation, and also think long and hard about the fact that I, Clarence Thomas, will get to determine whether gay people can marry each other.

Advertisement

That’s right, me: an embarrassingly undistinguished justice with a history of ethical misconduct who hasn’t spoken during an oral argument in almost seven years. I get to rule on whether gay people should have basic human rights.

Pretty crazy, right? I’m one of only nine Americans in a position to decide, in a matter of months, whether our democracy values the right of a group of human beings to get married.

Now, if you’re having a hard time wrapping your head around that one, you’re not alone. If you had told me in 1991 that I would one day have the power to decide the basic rights of millions of people, I would have laughed in your face. Back then, I was a 43-year-old appeals court judge with a flimsy record on civil rights and abortion who thought affirmative action was a form of “social engineering”—not exactly the kinds of views you’d expect in a jurist destined for the Supreme Court.

Yet lo and behold, that same year, despite accusations that I sexually harassed attorney Anita Hill, my appointment to replace retired justice Thurgood Marshall was confirmed. Soon enough, I was abstaining from oral arguments for years at a time and failing to disclose my wife’s sources of income.

I’ve spoken maybe two times in the past decade, for Christ’s sake. Think about that. That’s hundreds and hundreds of cases during which I’ve sat silently and twiddled my thumbs as my colleagues actively interrogated lawyers and posed tough questions about the scope and applications of laws—cases to which I barely paid attention, sometimes appearing to nap on the bench. And I get to have a say in deciding on a constitutional level whether or not all adult members of the human race have the right to recognize their unions? That historic judgment falls on my shoulders?

I’m not trying to belabor the point here. I just want you all to be fully aware that the future of gay and lesbian citizens in this country comes down to the opinion of nine people, one of whom—me—fell asleep during the inauguration of the first black president and believes states have the right to arrest illegal immigrants without a warrant.

Advertisement

Speaking of, here are some other things I believe: felons have the right to bear arms unless the state explicitly forbids it, Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided and should be overturned, corporations and unions should be permitted to spend unlimited amounts of money on political campaigns, and those campaigns should not be required to disclose donors.

Oh, and in 2003 I dissented in the court’s decision to strike down a Texas law prohibiting homosexual acts.

Advertisement

Yet in six months, in the year 2013, I’ll have the opportunity to decide whether hospitals can legally bar gay people from visiting their loved ones.

Take a second and think about the gay people in your life. Your best friend, your mom, your dad, your teacher, your coworker, your partner, you. I get to decide whether these people face institutional discrimination. The same goes for bisexual people, transgender people, and anyone else whose right to marry may be prohibited at the state or federal level. They are all searching for happiness, and their happiness all depends on the opinion of a man who once asked if someone put pubic hair on his Coke.

Advertisement

You want to hear something even weirder? Antonin Scalia gets to decide all this too.

So before these two judicial decisions are upon us, take a moment to reflect on what they mean for the future of our nation. As the tide of history turns and decisions of tremendous importance reach the highest court in the land, I will be there to judge them. Now, tomorrow, and for the rest of my life.",761,4406,12,68

Plus, it honestly feels like by filming him, I’d be inserting myself into his narrative, and if it’s my body camera, it really seems like I’m trying to make his death all about me. Not committing this violent tragedy to film is just the respectful thing to do.” The NYPD added that it seemed exploitative to publicize the man’s death because that would be what people remembered about him, so the department was refraining from releasing any details about the incident to respect his privacy.

Especially in this day and age as more fanboys and girls than ever are seeing their civil liberties infringed upon for peaceful acts like trying to level up their Charmeleon or grab a few extra Power Moons. That’s why we would like to take a moment to remind of one important thing:

If a cop asks you to stop gaming, please remember: You don’t have to.

That’s right. Regardless of how much a police officer might try to pressure you, it is your constitutional right to continue gaming. Whether you’re in the middle of a boss battle in Wolfenstein II or just sprucing up your island in Animal Crossing, as long as you don’t have any warrants out for your arrest and are not trespassing on private property, you are under no obligation to hit pause or put down your controller.

Advertisement

Generations of brave Americans didn’t fight to uphold the Bill of Rights just so some bully in uniform could unceremoniously force you to abandon an important Ghost Of Tsushima quest without saving. This country was founded on the principles of free and open gaming, and we’ll be damned to let those precious, God-given rights be taken away. As Thomas Jefferson once famously said, “Our liberty depends on our freedom to game.”

Always remember that, gamers. Always.

Now, should you find yourself in a situation where a law enforcement agent is asking you to stop gaming, don’t panic. Just stay calm. While keeping your eyes on the screen and your hands on your controller, politely yet firmly say something to this effect: “I do not consent to your request to stop playing video games. I am an American citizen, and it is my right to continue gaming in accordance with my protections under the Fourth Amendment.”

They might say things such as, “Sir, you’re blocking traffic,” or, “Sir, that law doesn’t exist,” or, “Sir, we’re investigating a murder,” in order to pressure you to stop. But never forget that you don’t have to comply with these unlawful requests. As long as you inform them of your gamer rights in a peaceful manner, you are not breaking any laws, state or federal.

In all likelihood, they will honor your wishes and carry along with their business, although it is possible they might not. Should they force you to stop gaming against your will, make sure to record your entire interaction with them and take down their badge number. And if you are able, make sure to jot down any XP or mission progress you may have lost as a result of the interaction, as you may be entitled to restitution later. You can also legally fight the police officer, should it come to that.

Of course, we’d like to say you won’t ever have to deal with this, but this is unfortunately not the case. There are cops out there who think we live in a banana republic, cops who think they can trample on anyone’s right to play Persona 5 to 100% completion in peace. But with an informed citizenry, we can fight these gross abuses of power. And in order to do that, it’s always best to be prepared.



Remember, gamers, the arc of history is long, but it bends towards gaming.",561,3160,15,69

We have also discovered that owls swallow their prey whole because the drug significantly reduces their appetite.” Wheelwright added that bats’ nocturnal lifestyle, on the other hand, could be attributed to their penchant for methamphetamines.",161,1058,9,72

In a press conference early Thursday morning, the Japanese console maker ushered in the end of an era with the bittersweet announcement that they will stop production of the PlayStation 5.

Wow, gamers. We knew something like this might be coming, but that doesn’t make it any less painful to know that this historic period in video game history is finally coming to a close.



“It was a wild ride, but all good things must come to an end,” said a visibly emotional Sony CEO Kenichiro Yoshida, pausing several times to collect himself while announcing the momentous decision to cease manufacturing the console. “We want to thank the designers and the game makers. But most of all we want to thank the fans for everything they did to make this the most incredible three months in our company’s history.”

“It was our privilege to bring the PlayStation 5 into your homes,” he concluded.



For fans of the iconic console, the decision—effective immediately—is an emotional moment that reveals exactly how far we’ve come since the console’s launch way back on November 12, 2020. In fact, there’s so much to remember, it’s hard to even know where to begin. Most will think back on the unforgettable times they spent with titles ranging from 2020's Astro’s Playroom to the Nioh 2 Remastered, also released in 2020. For us, though? Our nostalgia knobs will always be turned up to eleven just remembering last year’s cross-generation release of Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla.

Of course, it’s better to go out on top than for people to grow tired of you, and we wish Sony all the best on their farewell tour selling off their last backstock of consoles. And as much as we wish the PS5 could last forever, we prefer this to the sad spectacle of watching Microsoft trying to wring a few more months out of the doddering Xbox Series X.

We, for one, are glad to see Sony taking the classy way out. And though they might be closing the book on one of the most notable epochs in video games history, we can’t wait to see what they’re up to next!

You’ll absolutely eat it up when you see the “Trump ’16” T-shirts, the lawn signs, the bumper stickers; in fact, you’ll probably get a real kick out of pointing them out to your friends. Now, just imagine me shaking hands with senior citizens at a nursing home in Iowa. Wouldn’t you love to watch that? Or hear what comes out of my mouth when I speak to blue-collar workers at a struggling auto factory?



You say that doesn’t interest you? Oh, right, because you’re dying to see how Scott Walker behaves in those situations, right? Give me a break.

Just take a moment and imagine the primary debates: Jeb Bush; Chris Christie; me. Of course, they’ll put me in the middle because I’m ahead in the polls—far ahead at the moment. You already know how I answer even the most basic inquiries, so just picture me staring down the barrel of a question about foreign affairs or agriculture policy or something like that. You think you won’t sit there with bated breath while I try to tackle a question about using military force, or about food stamps, or about how my faith influences my decision-making? I guarantee you that my answers will be worth watching. And we both know you wouldn’t miss them for the world. It’d be the biggest, most-watched primary debate in history, courtesy of all of you.



And might I remind you that the longer this goes on, the closer I get to selecting a running mate. That realization kind of delighted you in a way, didn’t it? You absolutely want to know who I’d pick. A defeated GOP challenger who hates my guts? Another lunatic billionaire? Maybe my own son, Donald Trump Jr.? Whatever your wildest expectation is, I promise you I will surpass it. You’re not going to pass up an opportunity to see that, are you?

I can tell you’re practically salivating right now. And I’m going to keep riding this fascination, this little fixation you have with me as far as you’ll take me. You know I will.



So don’t try to tell me you’d be just as happy to watch one of these other bozos go toe-to-toe with Hillary Clinton or give a soaring speech at the national convention. And don’t delude yourself into thinking it’s everyone else who wants to watch me do this and you’re somehow above it. You want to see it. You want more. You hear “Trump” and your attention snaps to the TV screen right away.

Don’t think it’s true? Fine. You know what you have to do to make me go away. Just quit paying attention. Stop reading this right now.



That’s right, I didn’t think so.

So just keep clicking every link that mentions my name and hitting play on every clip of my public appearances, and I promise you will not be disappointed.

Feeling flooded with nostalgia right now? We bet. But things just get even more incredible from there, because the local temp employee and potential Banjo-Kazooie superfan went on to step on his bird! Not only that, but neighbors also told OGN that Lance has placed the bird in his backpack on several occasions. Talk about commitment!

The only thing that could have made this any more perfect is if Lance wasn’t wearing a shirt and was a lot more hairy, but when it comes to awesome Banjo-Kazooie content like this, we’ll take what we can get! Frankly, who knows how long it’s going to be until the next Banjo-Kazooie game. Until then, here’s hoping Lance helps tide us over by throwing Barney on the ground again and again!",233,1345,13,74

My friends, everybody has their down days, and during these long winter months it is especially easy to succumb to the doldrums and find yourself in a bit of a funk. But not to fear! I have a simple tip that’s guaranteed to pick you up and get you back in good spirits in no time, and here it is: Whenever you’re feeling low, just remember that I, Donald Trump, will be dead in roughly 15 to 20 years.

Advertisement

That’s right. In the not-very-distant future I will die and then be gone from the world for all eternity. You may even get to watch me in a casket on national television being lowered into the ground, never to be seen again. I bet you’re smiling just thinking about that.

Now, I recognize that the news out there in the world has been particularly depressing lately, and these days it’s understandable that one might begin to feel like there’s no hope and no reason to go on, but let me assure you that there is. Oh, boy, is there ever! Indeed, you can always take solace in the fact that the monstrous, unimaginable piece of shit that is me will stop existing fairly soon, and that I will continue to not exist for the remainder of your lifetime. Biologically speaking, I, the host of NBC’s The Apprentice and Celebrity Apprentice, have no more than two decades left to live. In fact, right now I’m just 10 years away from reaching the average lifespan of an American male.

How does that make you feel? Pretty good, right?

Sure, I’ll have a grand, opulent funeral that will be talked about and broadcast extensively, and all the news segment retrospectives on my life will probably be obnoxious to watch and listen to, and will very likely make you angry. But just think: all of those segments will end with a picture of my blustery, self-important face and the dates 1946–2031 printed beneath it. Or maybe 1946–2032. Or, who knows, maybe earlier! Even if you’re not feeling glum, I guarantee the recognition that my death is a concrete and rapidly approaching inevitability will make you feel even better.

And if my death in 15 or 20 years feels like it’s too far in the future to wash away your blues, you can take heart knowing that I’ll start to physically and mentally deteriorate well before then. Why, by 2020, I, a man who recently tried to extort the sitting president of the United States to release his college and passport records, might even begin to show signs of serious and unavoidable decline in mental and physical faculties, and doesn’t that just perk your spirits right up? Just imagine me shuffling along, hunched forward, with a noticeably shortened gait and perpetually haggard face. Heck, that might happen by the end of this decade! Of course there’s an outside chance I could make it another 25 years, but in a way, wouldn’t it be even more uplifting and enjoyable for everyone if I wasted away slowly and pitifully until I became a wizened and impossibly frail old relic—the pathetically impotent, papery husk of a once-powerful man?

Hey, I’ve got an idea! Let’s try a surefire pick-me-up that is certain to buoy your spirits right this very moment: let’s think of ways I could die! Perhaps I’ll suffer through a slow, excruciating kidney failure that leaves me in profound pain that the doctors just can’t treat. It could be a massive heart attack while I’m delivering a speech to investors, forcing me to clutch my chest in agony and stagger into the audience. It could be Alzheimer’s. Or I could even be diagnosed with a vicious form of cancer that at first appears to be responding well to chemotherapy but then takes a rapid and inescapable turn for the worse.

Advertisement

And of course there’s always the possibility that I’ll be declared brain-dead after a stroke and lie immobile on a hospital bed for a year or more before Melania finally works up the courage to pull the plug.

And if you need a real shot in the arm to get you laughing and smiling again, just remember that I could trip down a flight of stairs in my own ultra-plush luxury high-rise this very night and shatter my skull right there. Isn’t that great?

So there’s no reason to be wearing a frown, my friend. I will die, and I will die soon. And as long as you remember that, your days will be brighter. I promise.",764,4276,15,75

And I know it’s a cliché at this point, but there’s no way I’m going to California without going through wine country again.” At press time, the wildfire had realized that it was already spending so much time on the west coast it might as well stay all year round.

1,Bad News For Gamers: OGN Has Learned Ocarinas Are Real And They Goddamn Suck,https://ogn.theonion.com/bad-news-for-gamers-ogn-has-learned-ocarinas-are-real-1846145751,"If you were as big of a fan of Ocarina Of Time as a kid, you must have tons of fond memories of using the game’s eponymous musical instrument to solve puzzles and teleport across the kingdom of Hyrule. Frankly, it was one of the most incredible parts of leading Link on his quest to defeat the evil king Ganondorf. So, you can imagine how excited we were when we uncovered evidence that ocarinas are actually real. Yep, that’s right. These things really do exist. Now, you would think this would be a cause for celebration. However, upon further examination, we discovered something terribly unfortunate about them.

Gamers, we hate to be the bearer of bad news, but ocarinas fucking suck.

This may come as a major blow, but after doing a fair amount of research into ocarinas, we can definitely state that they’re just totally lame. They’re small and weird-looking, and for some reason, they’re always carved into stupid animal shapes. We have no idea what Nintendo was thinking by making them a centerpiece of such an important game, because as far as instruments go, you can’t do much worse than an ocarina. Even tubas are more dignified.

And it isn’t just their appearance, either. In an attempt to find a silver lining, we thought, perhaps naively so, that these stupid things might sound better than they look, but my God, were we wrong. We looked up a few videos of people playing ocarinas, and wow, it’s like listening to a fourth-grade recorder recital but somehow worse. Why anyone would want to listen to an ocarina, let alone play one, is beyond us. They’re honestly just glorified kazoos.

Our apologies if this is hard to stomach, gamers, but, trust us, we aren’t happy about it either.

Looking back on all the times the word “ocarina” evoked a powerful pang of nostalgia in us now just makes us feel like complete idiots. The worst part about all of this is that ocarinas don’t even have any actual powers. You can’t teleport with them, and playing one doesn’t actually open up any portals. They’re not at all the magical talismans we were led to believe. You basically just can blow into them and that’s it. Fucking pathetic.

Sorry to have to give you such an unpleasant reality check, but as always, readers, it is our duty as gaming journalists to keep you informed about things like this. If you’re like us, there’s no way you’ll be able to replay Ocarina Of Time now without constantly being reminded of how idiotic these things are. Fret not, though, gamers: We can always fall back on the totally badass memory from Wind Waker of conducting the breeze with a baton.

Sources confirmed that minutes before their contest against the Boston Red Sox was scheduled to begin, dozens of federal troops rushed onto the field and set upon the Yankees starters, pushing them into foul territory with riot shields and beating several of them—including Brett Gardner, Gio Urshela, and Gleyber Torres—with batons.

Seriously, the fact that my net worth isn’t just expressed by a Greek symbol makes it feel like I haven’t made any money at all.” At press time, Bezos lowered the wages of his warehouse workers even further in the hopes it would boost his earnings up to a level that’s outside the confines of conventional numbers.

Trump voters are a huge constituency, especially in crucial swing states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and it’s going to be tough to win them over if we keep alienating them with our rhetoric. We want a broad coalition here, which includes Trump supporters, and so going forward we’re eliminating any negative remarks about Donald Trump in campaign ads and speeches. It’s time to take a stand and say that defeating Trump is simply not what the Biden campaign stands for.” Reports from the Biden campaign also indicated that strategists were gaming out how many swing-state Trump supporters they would win over if they formally endorsed the president’s reelection.

WASHINGTON—Putting the nation on alert against what it has described as a “highly credible terrorist threat,” the FBI announced today that it has uncovered a plot by members of al-Qaeda to sit back and enjoy themselves while the United States collapses of its own accord.

Multiple intelligence agencies confirmed that the militant Islamist organization and its numerous affiliates intend to carry out a massive, coordinated plan to stand aside and watch America’s increasingly rapid decline, with terrorist operatives across the globe reportedly mobilizing to take it easy, relax, and savor the spectacle as it unfolds.

“We have intercepted electronic communication indicating that al-Qaeda members are actively plotting to stay out of the way while America as we know it gradually crumbles under the weight of its own self-inflicted debt and disrepair,” FBI Deputy Director Mark F. Giuliano told the assembled press corps. “If this plan succeeds, it will leave behind a nation with a completely dysfunctional economy, collapsing infrastructure, and a catastrophic health crisis afflicting millions across the nation. We want to emphasize that this danger is very real.”

“And unfortunately, based on information we have from intelligence assets on the ground, this plot is already well under way,” he added.

A recently declassified CIA report confirmed that all known al-Qaeda-affiliated organizations—from Pakistan to Yemen, and from Somalia to Algeria—have been instructed to kick back and enjoy the show as the United States’ federal government, energy grid, and industrial sector are rendered impotent by internal dissent, decay, and mismanagement. According to statements made by top-level informants and corroborated by leading Western terrorism experts, if seen through to its conclusion, al-Qaeda’s current plot could wreak far more damage than the events of 9/11.

In the past year, money transfers to al-Qaeda cells around the world have reportedly been accompanied by instructions to use the funds to outfit safe houses with the proper equipment to receive American cable news broadcasts and view top U.S. news websites, allowing terrorists to fully relish each detail of the impending demise of the last global superpower.

Additionally, FBI officials made public an internal al-Qaeda video today in which the terrorist organization’s leader Ayman al-Zawahiri chillingly exhorts his followers to “take a load off” and “unwind” in the name of jihad, and really cherish the victory over their enemy.

“Praise Allah, for soon every American city shall be plagued with disaster and hardship,” al-Zawahiri said in the video, which includes several minutes of footage of young, masked al-Qaeda militants casually sipping beverages as they thumb through the latest issues of Time and U.S. News And World Report. “The infidels have brought this pain and destruction upon themselves through their arrogance and callousness. Soon, the United States will watch in horror as its bridges crumble, its desperate citizens suffer in want of medicine and paying employment, and its once vast riches are reduced to naught. The righteous warriors among our ranks must now unite, get comfortable, and look on from afar at the calamity unfolding in the West.”

“We vow that we will not cease sitting around and laughing it up until America is reduced to rubble,” he continued.

Al-Zawahiri, who is seen in the video reclining back in his chair, putting his feet up, and flipping on CNN, later shouts “Allahu Akbar!” when a story is aired about the decade-long trend of stagnant wages among American workers.

The FBI has also warned that numerous al-Qaeda agents may have established sleeper cells for the purpose of “getting a kick out of” the nation’s downfall on American soil. The bureau urged U.S. residents to use caution around schools, hospitals, legislative bodies, prisons, and other decaying institutions whose imminent failure terrorists may wish to observe up close.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, one high-ranking U.S. counterterrorism official has described the present situation as a massive failure of intelligence.

“The warning signs were there all along, but unfortunately we failed to heed them,” said the official, who advised Americans to brace for widespread devastation. “If we’d listened to experts or even our own common sense, we would’ve realized that this plot was being actively orchestrated within our own borders. But we didn’t, and now every one of our citizens and our very way of life is at risk from this threat.”

“Sadly, al-Qaeda has us right where they want us,” the official added, “and at this point, I fear it is too late to do anything about it.”

And whatever you do, try not to let the flesh melt off your body until you’re only a skeleton like you did during the last practice session, as this could be looked upon as a sign of weakness.” At press time, the debate prep had been halted after Trump became furious over conflicting advice from a snake-covered George Washington and himself as a two-year-old.

The sheer lack of positive experiences he’s had with football probably mean he’s scarred for life, but that doesn’t make him a bad quarterback. We think with some love and attention, he could get healthy and maybe even become a decent backup.” At press time, Sam had scrambled under a bench and started crying after seeing the Jets logo on the Panthers 2021 regular season schedule.

Ron DeSantis, who noted that state health officials had worked around the clock to implement the plan before spring break, burying the needles beneath thin layers of sand or positioning them so they poke out between the planks of a boardwalk. “We hope a lot of people will get pricked accidentally while socializing at their favorite party beach, stopping to pick up a pretty seashell, or sitting back to relax with a drink in their hand and their toes in the sand.

Meanwhile, it provides laid-off employees the freedom to look for a new job anywhere else they want. It’s an exciting new frontier for us, and, frankly, I only wish we’d thought of it sooner.” The report concluded that the new standard of office work might even give terminated workers the option to leave the city and move in with their parents while they sort some things out.

This is the kind of bias we have in the media right now. You know that if Donald Trump was at the town hall instead they would make him answer the question before it was asked.” Fox News pundits additionally slammed CNN for unfairly giving Biden’s campaign advance notice about the town hall’s format, location, and the fact that it was being nationally televised.

After extensive conversation among the experts at the Onion Gamer’s Network Decision Desk, we are officially calling New Hampshire for gamers.

We’ve seen enough: The Granite State is for gamers, by gamers, and all about gamers.



Although we only have reports from 60% of polling stations at this point, our analysts can tell us with a high degree of certainty that New Hampshire is a statistical certainty to go for gamers tonight. This is particularly clear if you look at the makeup of the remaining uncounted districts, which are all from video game–friendly areas. Most of these communities have at least one Secretlab Omega gaming chair per household and rank traditional gamer values like support for LAN Parties and subsidies for guarana-based beverages as the most important issues to them and their loved ones.

Needless to say, this is a sea change of the nationwide landscape for gamers. Yes, we saw some seeds of this in 2012 when areas around Baltimore saw higher Xbox enthusiasts in the so-called Green Tsunami, but it seemed that the promise of a fully gaming-forward New Hampshire was always going to be a pipe dream for video game fans.

Gamers, that dream has now become a reality.

Now, is this a surprise? Not necessarily. Sure, there was worry that infighting among PlayStation and Switch gamers would split the vote and serve as a spoiler for tonight’s results. But these console fanboys and fangirls were able to come together to form a multi-coalition gaming bloc, stringing together a big tent along with mobile gamers and casuals that’s allowed video gaming to take New Hampshire by storm.

Frankly, it’s a relief for us at OGN to end the long nights of pounding MTN Dew Major Melon to stay up late for result-tallying and finally say, definitively, that New Hampshire has gone for gamers. And, of course, as much as we strive to keep our process objective, it’s important to admit that many of us were actually pulling for gamers to emerge triumphant today. Certainly, this paves the way for a bold gaming agenda over the next few years.

We’ll get back to you in three weeks when these results are certified by the gaming judges. But it’s worthwhile to take a moment to truly appreciate the magnitude of what’s happened tonight. Because it’s big, gamers. Really big.

Hopefully, we can make it to the inauguration before people start asking questions.

I did think we had something special with this act, though, and it’s nice to see now that it really means something to so many people.

Tear gas has always been intended for soldiers, law enforcement, and other authorities to control other, less powerful people by causing them severe pain, so any association with it being used according to its designed purpose really doesn’t look good for us. We just want to stress that our intended use for tear gas, whether it’s to disperse peaceful activists or to assault crowds of migrants, could not be any closer to what these products were actually used for.” The nation’s tear gas manufacturers added that critics of their products consistently failed to appreciate the care that they took to ensure that tear gas was not supposed to be lethal.",243,1476,12,82

The Ghost of Christmas Future offers a pair of Phoenix 10-year-olds a tantalizing glimpse of the PS5.

""You know how kids are—a year is an eternity to them,"" the wraithlike specter said Monday during a visit to the Southfield home of 13-year-old Josh Kuehn. ""So just imagine showing them something they'll have to wait 14 years for. Teasing them with a glimpse of the PS5 is the ultimate torture. They absolutely lose their minds. It's like saying, 'Hey, kid, you'll be an old man before you ever get to touch this.'""

The Ghost of Christmas Future said he has visited more than 125,000 homes since Thanksgiving, offering children an agonizing sneak peek at what they cannot have for another decade and a half.

""I like to appear in the living room with a PS5 hooked up to 2016's most popular TV, the 4'x8' Hi-Def Sony Titania,"" the Ghost said. ""Then, I'll say in my best spooky voice, 'Jimmy! Behold what your kids will be playing while you're slaving away at an office job to support them!'""

Driving the children mad with PS5 lust, the Ghost said, is a multi-step process.

""I usually start by showing them Toteki Aluminum, one of the future's most popular fight-and-chase games,"" the Ghost said. ""It's far from the best available in 2016, but it always blows their mind to see the guy get hit with the falling sign while the drops of sweat fly off his face. You can see the whole scene, distorted, in each of the individual drops. That gives them a good preliminary idea of the graphics technology we're dealing with.""

The Ghost said he then likes to show Airsledz, a racing game in which jet-powered sleds whoosh through a four-dimensional racing course in the sky. The game, he said, enables the player to compete online against dozens of other players all around the world.

""They always ask if you can play it on the Internet—it's so cute how they still call it 'the Internet'—and I tell them, 'Hey, you can play this against 63 other PS5 owners simultaneously. At least you can in 14 years,'"" the Ghost said. ""And you should see their jaws hit the floor when they learn about the add-on accessories that enable users to actually fly around the room during gameplay.""

Once the capabilities of the system are conveyed to the children, the Ghost likes to push them further over the edge by showing them games specially targeted to their age group.

Younger children, he said, salivate upon seeing Level One of Zonic Fugue. In it, Zonic, the indigo-colored son of Sonic The Hedgehog, faces off against Chuckles The Echidna in a Terrordactyl sky-joust, attempting to earn the Ankle Rockets he needs to gather the five Chaos Sapphires that, when combined, form the master key that opens the Melody Dome.

To break the spirits of children 12 and up, the Ghost runs a brief demonstration of Back To Werewolf Island. The horror-action thriller, he said, will be produced in full 10.8 Omneo sound and feature new music from 40 of 2016's hottest skagcore acts, including FU3P, Dredgerous, and Frances Cobain.

""Sometimes, the kids will start getting defensive and say, 'Yeah, well, I don't know any of those characters, so big deal,'"" the Ghost said. ""That's when I pull out DC vs. Marvel.""

The Ghost said he shows the children a brief clip of DC vs. Marvel, in which cinema-realistic figures of Spider-Man and the Joker dash across impossibly detailed city streets, attacking each other with dozens of different offensive maneuvers while leaping, somersaulting, and throwing objects.

""They usually start trembling at that point,"" the Ghost said. ""That's when I go in for the kill by casually mentioning that the game comes packaged with the 2016 feature film of the same name—not on DVD, of course, but on SCAP. Ten times better.""

The few children unbroken by DC vs. Marvel are invariably finished off by the sight of Star Wars—Episode IX: Jedi Destiny, a game which employs the world's most advanced artificial-intelligence algorithm to place the player inside the film's climactic battle sequence on the planet Mon Jeedam.

""With more than 12,000 distinct soldiers, creatures, and vehicles fighting at once, and the option to command the New Republic Fleet, the Imperial Armada, or the Yuuzhan Vong Invasion Force, it's not merely the best Star Wars game that's ever existed; it's an interactive film that looks better than any movie that's ever been made. No child has failed to sob hysterically at the sight of it.""

The PlayStation 5 will be available in stores Nov. 12, 2016, at a list price of Δ399 New Dollars ($199 Canadian).",845,5059,13,83

There aren’t any efforts of submitting the ballots of deceased Wisconsin residents or by people trying to vote multiple times that we could see before we tossed them in the trash. This just goes to show that concerns about voter fraud have been way overblown. It’s very encouraging.” Wisconsin officials added that their examination of votes did find a negligible 0.05% of ballots that they were going to count.

Unfortunately, Stalin passed away before he could round up just one last group of intellectuals and make them dig their own mass graves.” Morrison also noted that Stalin likely came closer to creating a communist utopia than any other leader in world history besides China’s Mao Tse-tung, who actually achieved it.",175,1116,13,83

Look, ICE was obviously intended to be a punitive, discriminatory organization—it’s under the jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland Security, for fuck’s sake. It’s a stain on America’s record. I ask you to join me in calling for whoever established this agency to be thrown into prison to rot. Fuck them.” Bush’s op-ed comes on the heels of fellow former First Lady Michelle Obama’s recent piece in the New York Times demanding full prosecution of whatever morally bankrupt political official permitted ICE to continue growing increasingly unaccountable and sadistic throughout the early 2010s.

My fellow Americans, as I write this, the United States government is experiencing its first shutdown in 17 years. Democrats are quick to place blame on the Republican Party, and have accused us of taking this country hostage. President Obama has said our attempt to fund the government by defunding Obamacare is an attempt to extract a ransom solely for doing our jobs. He’s likened some members of our party to right-wing fanatics.

But let’s talk about Obamacare.

Three years ago, President Barack Obama passed a disastrous piece of legislation called the Affordable Care Act. He jammed this jobs-killing, deficit-increasing monstrosity through Congress, purely along party lines. And in 2010 the American people spoke loud and clear and elected a new wave of young Republicans to the House, which rejuvenated our party and allowed us to once again become the majority. This fresh crop of eager Republicans was elected to stop this president’s reckless spending and repeal Obamacare.

The American people sent us a clear message: Keep the government out of our health care and save this country.

And that’s what myself and my Republican colleagues are determined to do. Let me be clear: This is President Barack Obama’s government shutdown. This president consistently refuses to negotiate with Republicans about a piece of legislation that is confusing, drastically unpopular with the American people, and poisonous to our way of life.

Instead of coming to the table with Republicans, the president would rather talk to Vladimir Putin or the new president of Iran. Instead of improving the livelihoods of the American people, he would rather resort to name-calling. Instead of having a dialogue, he would rather call members of my party extremists and children and say they are on an ideological crusade. Instead of respecting my viewpoint, he would rather question my leadership and say the tail is wagging the dog.

Is this what people want from their president?

In the past two days, the Republicans in the House have passed numerous bills that would fund the government and get America’s health care system back on the right track. But each bill we pass has been rejected by the president and the Senate without so much as a debate. It seems like the Republican Party and our “team of extremists” are the only ones in Washington actually working to help the American people and get us out of this mess. If the president wishes to end this government shutdown that he created, then he must come to his senses and recognize that the public has spoken and Obamacare must go.

Help me. Please, God, help me. I’ve lost control and I need help.

The far right members of my party are insane. I don’t know what they’re thinking, and I don’t want to know because it would be too horrifying. I’ve tried to explain it to them over and over and they don’t listen to me. They don’t listen to anybody. I say to them, nobody wants a government shutdown, Obamacare is the law of the land, the president was reelected and elections have consequences, and we are only in charge of one branch of government.

I say all of that and they just look at me with these cold, dead eyes. Christ, It’s chilling.

Look, these people scare me. They scare all of us. Have you heard them talk? They’re animals, these people. There are only 30 or 40 of them and we outnumber them, but they have so much power, you see? They could end me like that. And they wouldn’t feel a thing because these people do not feel. They are out for blood: my blood, the president’s blood, the blood of any American who doesn’t agree with them.

I hate them. I hate all of them. And yet I also fear them.

I want to admit something: I’ve cried in my office every day for the last month. During this shutdown I’ve sat there, panicked and alone, scared to death about the next thing they’ll make me do. When they knock on my door, my heart stops. What are they going to make me say next? How are they going to force me to embarrass myself next? Did you know I was once known as a relatively moderate, shrewd politician? That was before 2010. Before the horror began.

They haunt my dreams at night. I have this one nightmare where I’m about to ask for a vote on a clean continuing resolution and then one of them—I think it’s Steve King from Iowa—looks at me with this eerie smile and says, “No, John. No you won’t.” And then the rest of them are suddenly standing behind him and they all chant in a chilling monotone, “No, John. No you won’t.” And then I wake up screaming, “No, John!!! No you won’t!!!” and I’m crying, and my wife is crying, and I’ve sweat through my sheets.

Help me. Help me make this end. Don’t reelect these people. Reelect good, normal people and I promise I’ll be a good speaker from now on. I won’t lie down for the president by any stretch of the imagination, but I’ll work with him if it makes sense and I’ll fight him when it makes sense. That’s how it should be. That’s how it will be if you help me destroy this menace.

Clearly, we may need to reevaluate some of our ideas about the Son of God, especially now that our scholarship has revealed how Christ actively incited a crowd on the Mount of Olives to stone an adulterer to death.” Atherton went on to state that the gospel story of Jesus causing a herd of pigs to become possessed by demons and run off a cliff to their death was, however, perfectly translated.",235,1441,12,86

My friends, everybody has their down days, and during these long winter months it is especially easy to succumb to the doldrums and find yourself in a bit of a funk. But not to fear! I have a simple tip that’s guaranteed to pick you up and get you back in good spirits in no time, and here it is: Whenever you’re feeling low, just remember that I, Donald Trump, will be dead in roughly 15 to 20 years.

That’s right. In the not-very-distant future I will die and then be gone from the world for all eternity. You may even get to watch me in a casket on national television being lowered into the ground, never to be seen again. I bet you’re smiling just thinking about that.

Now, I recognize that the news out there in the world has been particularly depressing lately, and these days it’s understandable that one might begin to feel like there’s no hope and no reason to go on, but let me assure you that there is. Oh, boy, is there ever! Indeed, you can always take solace in the fact that the monstrous, unimaginable piece of shit that is me will stop existing fairly soon, and that I will continue to not exist for the remainder of your lifetime. Biologically speaking, I, the host of NBC’s The Apprentice and Celebrity Apprentice, have no more than two decades left to live. In fact, right now I’m just 10 years away from reaching the average lifespan of an American male.

How does that make you feel? Pretty good, right?

Sure, I’ll have a grand, opulent funeral that will be talked about and broadcast extensively, and all the news segment retrospectives on my life will probably be obnoxious to watch and listen to, and will very likely make you angry. But just think: all of those segments will end with a picture of my blustery, self-important face and the dates 1946–2031 printed beneath it. Or maybe 1946–2032. Or, who knows, maybe earlier! Even if you’re not feeling glum, I guarantee the recognition that my death is a concrete and rapidly approaching inevitability will make you feel even better.

And if my death in 15 or 20 years feels like it’s too far in the future to wash away your blues, you can take heart knowing that I’ll start to physically and mentally deteriorate well before then. Why, by 2020, I, a man who recently tried to extort the sitting president of the United States to release his college and passport records, might even begin to show signs of serious and unavoidable decline in mental and physical faculties, and doesn’t that just perk your spirits right up? Just imagine me shuffling along, hunched forward, with a noticeably shortened gait and perpetually haggard face. Heck, that might happen by the end of this decade! Of course there’s an outside chance I could make it another 25 years, but in a way, wouldn’t it be even more uplifting and enjoyable for everyone if I wasted away slowly and pitifully until I became a wizened and impossibly frail old relic—the pathetically impotent, papery husk of a once-powerful man?

Hey, I’ve got an idea! Let’s try a surefire pick-me-up that is certain to buoy your spirits right this very moment: let’s think of ways I could die! Perhaps I’ll suffer through a slow, excruciating kidney failure that leaves me in profound pain that the doctors just can’t treat. It could be a massive heart attack while I’m delivering a speech to investors, forcing me to clutch my chest in agony and stagger into the audience. It could be Alzheimer’s. Or I could even be diagnosed with a vicious form of cancer that at first appears to be responding well to chemotherapy but then takes a rapid and inescapable turn for the worse.

And of course there’s always the possibility that I’ll be declared brain-dead after a stroke and lie immobile on a hospital bed for a year or more before Melania finally works up the courage to pull the plug.

And if you need a real shot in the arm to get you laughing and smiling again, just remember that I could trip down a flight of stairs in my own ultra-plush luxury high-rise this very night and shatter my skull right there. Isn’t that great?

So there’s no reason to be wearing a frown, my friend. I will die, and I will die soon. And as long as you remember that, your days will be brighter. I promise.",764,4276,17,87

When this debate started, I was definitely on the fence, but while Trump and Biden are up there bloviating, this Wallace guy is staying calm and asking good questions, plus he appears to really care about the answers. I’m voting Wallace for sure.” Wills added that he hadn’t made up his mind this early about who to vote for since the strong first-debate performance during the 2012 election by Jim Lehrer.

Even if he appears to be focused on driving the car or reading peacefully next to you in bed, his thoughts are almost certainly racing with multiple ways he could end things right then and there.” Hagerty added that on the majority of occasions when a boyfriend says “I love you,” he’s actually preparing to segue into a rehearsed breakup speech.",226,1369,13,88

Our analysis also shows that, given how often celebrities like Ryan Gosling, Selena Gomez, and the Hemsworth brothers have sex, they are probably incredible at it. In addition, a degree of status is conferred upon anyone who has sex with a major star, as they are forever known within their social group as the one who had sex with Drake or Kristen Stewart.” Mulbin added that even in the worst-case scenario, in which a person contracts an incurable STI from an A-list celebrity, the accompanying sexual gratification would still “totally be worth it.”

Where’s the evidence for this nonsense? There is none. This is America, you don’t just say things like that. Shame on him. This has never happened in 244 years of this country’s existence, and it certainly won’t happen now.” At press time, Tapper had rapidly cut away from a press conference in which Biden described the lofty democratic ideals of the f ounding f athers in order to call the presidential candidate’s beliefs pathetic.",228,1369,14,89

Ta ke another four years in the White House? Or eight years, frankly. We never thought it mattered that much, but, sure, go ahead. Just stop stressing out about it.” At press time, the American people added that they would be okay with Josh Hawley, too, if being president would shut him up.

And look, times change, and there’s no shame in being profitable—we just want them to pay their fair share.” At press time, hundreds of thousands of Americans had signed a petition demanding that the U.S. government hold the KKK accountable for back taxes if they fail to pay their corporate income taxes once their nonprofit status is revoked.

We even have two units of affordable housing to satisfy city requirements in what used to be the stadium’s bathrooms.

Unfortunately, due to this breakdown of justice, we were unable to prevent what Mr. Epstein did for the past several decades.” Barr then vowed to follow proper Department of Justice protocol by continuing this investigation until his team found out exactly who they could lay all the responsibility on for the negligence.

UNDISCLOSED LOCATION—Persecuted and driven into hiding because of their beliefs, the nation’s oppressed Christians reportedly huddled in a secret underground bunker late Wednesday night to decorate and light a single withered Christmas shrub.

At great personal risk, the Christians were said to have smuggled in a few strings of colored mini lights, tinsel, popcorn garlands, Hallmark Keepsake ornaments, and other contraband in order to trim the shrub inside the subterranean chamber, the last place in America where they were safe to celebrate Christmas.

“We have come together today to observe a Christian holiday that has been all but stamped out on the surface,” said a man who wished to be identified only as “Greg,” after hanging a figurine of Mickey Mouse dressed as Santa Claus from one of the shrub’s boughs. “I can’t say this humble bush is much of a Christmas tree, but it was the largest we could manage to get here, given the circumstances. Let us remember, though, that to merely celebrate Christmas—to exchange gifts and eat our candy canes in peace—without the government or the powerful secular elite coming in and destroying it is a blessing in itself.”

“They want to bring an end to our holiest day,” he added, as several others erected a 3-foot-tall light-up Grinch and plastic signpost bearing the words “Santa Stop Here” behind him. “It is up to us to keep Christmas alive.”



After double-checking on the chamber’s entrance hatch to ensure it was tightly closed and locked, Greg then reportedly led the gathered Christians in hushed renditions of “God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen” and “A Holly Jolly Christmas” as the shrub was lit.

Those in attendance, many of whom had trekked hundreds or even thousands of miles, spoke of the great sacrifices they had made solely so that they could look upon an actual Christmas tree with their own eyes. A number of the Christians recounted how they had secretly carried a brightly painted plastic nativity scene and an inflatable 7-foot-tall snowman to the secret site, the latter item having been trafficked across three states in a truck with a false bottom. Others mentioned how they had sewed a few star- and wreath-shaped sugar cookies into the linings of their coats to avoid detection by the masses who sought to erase their holiday—and ultimately, their entire faith—from American life.

Reports confirmed that many who had arrived in the hidden underground sanctuary immediately broke down in tears upon being greeted with the forbidden words “Merry Christmas,” a phrase none had heard spoken openly in years for fear of harsh reprisals.

“It was difficult and dangerous to get here, but it’s all worth it to actually be able to celebrate the birth of Jesus,” said a 42-year-old teacher from Virginia who refused to give her name as she helped flock the shrub with a spray can of fake snow and arranged gifts of Yankee Candles and Amazon gift cards underneath its meager branches. “Unfortunately, this is the only way we can practice our beliefs now that corporations, the media, and our elected leaders have all conspired to remove every trace of Christmas from the country.”

“I just want to make sure my kids know what Christmas is really about,” she continued, adjusting the plush reindeer antlers atop her head and switching on her glowing Rudolph nose.

After the Christmas shrub was lit, the Christians were reportedly grateful to partake in other sacred traditions without fear of interference or abuse, such as the reading of the 2005 storybook classic The Elf On The Shelf and the viewing of grainy VHS copies of A Charlie Brown Christmas, The Santa Clause, and other beloved films that had been passed down through the generations.

Sources confirmed that as the evening drew to a close, all of their wrapping paper, Christmas cards, and fabric Santa hats were burned in trash cans to erase any evidence of the shunned celebration. The wary Christians then reportedly removed all incriminating green-and-red items from their persons and dispersed in small groups so as not to attract attention from federal authorities.

SAN FRANCISCO—In a shocking discovery certain to complicate the legacy of a national icon, the estate of Walt Disney announced Friday it had discovered a cache of anti-American cartoons the pioneering animator intended to release if the Axis Powers had triumphed in World War II.

The newfound materials reveal that in 1942, as Hitler’s war machine was nearing the height of its European occupation, Disney ordered his studio to produce animated propaganda praising a global empire ruled by Germany, Italy, and Japan. Hidden away in a vault for nearly 75 years—and starring classic characters such as Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck—the never-before-seen shorts and feature-length works depict Americans as lazy, corrupt, and inferior to the morally upstanding German patriots who will soon conquer them.

“There are hours of cartoons in which Mickey and the gang teach American children that U.S. soldiers were cowardly murderers and a worldwide Jewish conspiracy was responsible for the war,” said Walt Disney Family Museum curator Eileen Bryant as she described Wehrmacht Duck, which features Nazi paratrooper Donald shouting “Blood and soil!” as he lands in an American town, distributes copies of Mein Kampf to teachers, and lectures Nordic-looking children on racial hygiene. “Walt wanted to cover all his bases in the event of an Allied surrender. If the D-Day invasion had failed, he would have sent his first short, U-Boat Willie, directly to Joseph Goebbels.”

“He just wanted to make sure his production company had distribution and a market, whether he was living under a sovereign American government or Hitler’s thousand-year Reich,” she added.

Title card from the 1943 Huey, Dewey, and Louie short The Third Reich Is All-Reich With Me.

The Disney estate confirmed one of the features found in the vault is a remake of Fantasia in which Jewish composer Paul Dukas’ “Sorcerer’s Apprentice” is replaced with an all-Wagner score. The revised story reportedly centers around a young Mickey Mouse who, upon discovering his true Aryan heritage in a dream, reawakens as an Übermaus and begins goose-stepping in time to the increasingly feverish music. Documents indicate that following an Axis victory, Disney would have had the movie screened in every theater across North America, along with a re-cut version of Bambi that depicts the title character’s mother and all the forest animals as genetically defective creatures who are rightfully slaughtered by the film’s heroic hunters.

According to studio memos, all screenings would begin with a featurette in which FDR—portrayed by Goofy as an effeminate weakling whose pants fall down to the sound of a slide whistle every time he attempts to rise from his wheelchair—is sent to a camp for liquidation.

“A lot of these cartoons were aimed at convincing Americans of German heritage they were victims of a Jewish-led assault on their culture, especially the shorts starring Heinrich, Diedrick, and Ludwig,” said Bryant, referencing the duckling brothers better known as Huey, Dewey, and Louie. “In 1943’s The Third Reich Is All-Reich With Me, the brothers are rewarded for alerting their Waffen-SS uncle Donald to the secret hiding place of Pluto the Plutocrat, a dog with a Star of David pendant hanging from his collar. As a show of gratitude, the Gestapo decides to make them honorary secret police-ducks.”

Estate officials confirmed the collection also contains propaganda intended to prepare Americans for a Nazi occupation, including a public service announcement in which Minnie Mouse, an emblem of Aryan motherhood who has renounced her U.S. citizenship, is seen embroidering the words “Long live our glorious Führer” on a shawl. She tells viewers how proud she is to be raising children for the Fatherland and encourages American-born members of the master race to begin assembling baptismal records so their new masters can verify the purity of their blood.

“All these works, along with Walt’s early concept art of a swastika-festooned Epcot Center, were locked away after V-E Day,” Bryant said. “By today’s standards, they of course seem bigoted, even hateful, but it’s important to view them within the historical context in which they were made.”

“Except all the Japanese stuff,” Bryant continued. “Those caricatures were super racist even when they were supposed to be the good guys.”",723,4587,14,92

We’re feeling pretty annoyed right now because we just walked into the OGN offices after taking the weekend off and we were met with a nasty surprise: W e forgot to drain our new Xbox Series X over the weekend, and now all the game fluid leaked out.



Advertisement

Ugh, this sucks.

Obviously, the manual says to drain your Series X every six to eight hours with the included syringe, but we just completely neglected to head into work a few times to open up the excess valve and make sure the video game runoff didn’t gunk up the works. It really spilled everywhere— the whole outside of the console is green with congealed gaming fluid, the fluid valve has shattered from excess pressure, and it looks like a fair amount of the stuff even dripped down the table and seeped into the carpet.

This is a major drag, and it’s made all the worse by the fact that we have no one to blame but ourselves. We even remember thinking on Friday, “Hmm, it’s been a while since anyone drained the Xbox, and we’ve been going pretty hard on Demon’s Souls lately, so we probably need to soon.” On the other hand, it was the end of the day and we didn’t want to have to walk all the way to the bathroom to flush it down the toilet. Oh well, we suppose hindsight is 20/20.

Oh, crap. Now that we’ve been standing in here for a little while, it’s really clear that the distinctive bitter gaming fluid smell has seeped into most of the fabric, too. God, it’s really noxious. Maybe it would help if we open a window or something.

We guess this is just one of those things that happens to you once and then you learn your lesson. Suffice it to say, we won’t leave the office again without double-checking each and every one of our Xboxes to en sure the gaming fluid dial is at 50% or lower. Honestly, at this point, this whole thing has been such a headache, so we’re thinking about maybe even investing in one of those automatic fluid changers that they sell on Hammacher Schlemmer.

Okay, gamers, well we’re going to grab some Lysol and paper towels and try to dab out some of it out of the drapes, but honestly, we don’t know if it’s going to require a professional cleaning or what. Yuck. What a morning.",412,2206,19,93

Should candidates wish to flip some of these voters to either Obama-Clinton-Obama-Clinton, or Romney-Trump-Romney-Trump, they’ll have their work cut out for them.” At press time, Underwood added that these voters were notoriously hard to court because casting their vote for a different candidate could create a time paradox that irrevocably changed the world, thereby erasing them forever from the spacetime continuum.

Mark Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who added that while the military had made strides in recent years, proportional representation of women and people of color among leadership remained just a fraction of the diversity represented in countries like Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, and Somalia. “In country after country we invade, we see that there’s a diversity that’s lacking among our top leaders, and this initiative will take steps to change that imbalance. We need more Muslims, more folks of Arabic descent, not only African Americans but Africans too. We don’t have children represented at all at the top levels of Pentagon leadership. When the U.S. is ignoring every tenet of international law to pursue its own financially driven objectives in your country, whether you’re a victim of a drone strike, had your government overthrown, or just live in the daily terror of violence, you should be able to point to one of the people doing that to you and say, ‘That person looks like me.’” U.S. military officials announced that their first phase would involve armed recruitment of potential candidates representing the backgrounds of countries they invade, and they were prepared to integrate them into leadership by force.

“In his latest post, Q told us we must all come together under a Biden presidency in order to heal the nation, and while that may be a nice sentiment, I’m not sure if he wants us to just set aside all the stuff we believe about Democrats or what,” said local QAnon adherent Jeff White, who expressed the confusion plaguing many in his group when he asked how he was supposed to put his respect for the democratic process above his conviction that Biden belonged to a party of devil-worshipping, child-molesting cannibals. “Q’s saying that whether you’re a red-pilled freedom fighter who serves the Lord or a pedophile who drinks the blood of infants, we’re all Americans at the end of the day. In other words, sure, Joe Biden is enabling homicidal Satanists, but he’s still the person voters have chosen as their president, and you have to respect him.”

“That may sound a little crazy, but maybe Q’s right,” he continued. “Maybe if we want to make this country a better place, we have to find common ground with people who don’t necessarily share our views on the need to bring about ‘the Storm’ and stop global elites from consuming the flesh of children they traffic for sex. Look, I’m not a Biden fan, but I did notice Hillary never campaigned for him—that means there’s a good chance he had her executed, which would be a promising development for our cause.”

According to sources, most QAnon fellows were disappointed President Trump had lost reelection, but were holding out hope that John F. Kennedy Jr. would soon land his plane in Wilmington, DE and agree to head up Biden’s transition team.",325,1910,13,94

We were super excited when Gears Of War and Unreal creator Cliff Bleszinski decided to grace our Onion Gamer’ s Expo with his presence, but then this son of a bitch just took off with 10,000 of our free EA Games pens!

Go dd ammit, what a complete asshole!

As one of the many truly unique facets of the OGN g aming c onference, we were able to partner with EA Games to give each of our attendees a free pen bearing the video game developer’s logo completely free of charge. When Cliff Bleszinski first arrived he took three or four of them— a reasonable amount of pens that should satisfy the average person. But it’s apparently not enough for the greedy prick. We’re well aware that we didn’t have a sign that indicated only taking just one, but this is unbelievable.

We were under the impression that Bleszinski was excited to talk to an audience about his design philosophy with the Gears franchise and maybe sign a few copies , but when it came time for the panel we scheduled, he was peeling out from the parking lot cackling to himself with a van full of our precious EA Games pens.

Cliff Bleszinski, you unconscionable bastard!

What’s disappointing is this was one of the main points of promotion for this conference. We paid an ungodly amount for targeted ads to gamers that read “ Come to the OGE and receive a free white EA Games click pen!” Now we’re left wondering if the only reason why Bleszinski agreed to the conference in the first place was so he could sneak behind our booth to steal boxes of pens while the security guard wasn’t looking.

Given that he took every pen we had, it’s hard to tell if this was simply an act of Machiavellian self-interest or some kind of declaration of war against our conference itself. You have to assume that he has the money to buy 10,000 pens if he wants. But why would someone need this many pens? Maybe he intends to offload them to a fence who can sell them on the black market.

Regardless of the reason, this is a huge dick move.

Christ, sorry you had to find out like this, gamers. But Cliff Bleszinski is the true scum of the Earth for taking off with all 10,000 of our EA Games pens, and we also sincerely apologize that nobody else will get the opportunity to have a free pen. We know it comes as a huge disappointment, but you’ll have to make do with the free EA Games bouncy balls and coasters while we all wish that Cliffy B would go straight to hell.",463,2526,16,96

Jose Canseco and Barstool Sports? That is nothing more than income inequality and racial tension. These are telltale signs of denial. You saw the same thing in Russia before the revolution.” Huerta ended her announcement by calling on Congress to act now before the country de scended into a Mike Tyson vs. Post Malone– level disaster.

1,Report: Growing Number Of Americans Forced To Make Ends Meet By Collaborating On Song With Pitbull,https://entertainment.theonion.com/report-growing-number-of-americans-forced-to-make-ends-1819576481,"Tens of thousands of Americans say they are only able to pay their bills by shouting hooks in both Spanish and English on a Pitbull single.

MIAMI—In a further sign that the sluggish economic recovery continues to pose a challenge to the nation’s workforce, a report published Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Labor revealed that a growing number of Americans have had to resort to collaborating on songs with Cuban-American rapper Pitbull in order to make ends meet.

Advertisement

The paper, which attributed its findings to stagnant wages and lackluster job growth, confirmed that many poor and middle-class Americans have little choice but to pick up additional work with the chart-topping recording artist, often by contributing backing vocals, writing lyrics, producing Latin-infused beats, or repeatedly shouting the name “Pitbull” in studio sound booths as a means of providing for their families in this challenging economic climate.

“Since the stock market crash and housing sector collapse in 2008, we’ve seen a staggering increase in the number of Americans who are putting in long, demanding hours behind the mixing console with hip-hop sensation Pitbull,” said economist Jared Coan, lead author of the report. “While in decades past a single salary was enough to support a family of four, we are now finding that many breadwinners, out of financial necessity, are seeking out additional work laying down guest verses on dance-rap studio tracks like ‘Timber’ or any one of a number of its club mixes.”

“Most of these people are working a full day at their 9-to-5 jobs and then heading right into the RCA Records studio to program electronic drums for a Pitbull–Rick Ross collaboration until the early morning,” Coan continued. “Then, if they’re lucky, they have time to grab a couple hours of sleep before waking up the next day and doing it all over again.”

Faced with mounting credit card debt, surging health care costs, and in many cases pricey college tuition for their children, citizens across the country are feeling compelled to supplement their take-home pay by joining Pitbull—also known as Mr. Worldwide—on recording dates and the occasional live performance on the Planet Pit World Tour, Coan said. Specifically, survey data indicate that tens of thousands of Americans—from cashiers and food service workers, to those in formerly solid middle-class jobs, like automotive workers and insurance salespeople—have to juggle their day jobs with playing claves on a Spanish-language version of “Hotel Room Service,” spitting freestyle bars alongside guest hip-hop artists such as Flo Rida and T-Pain, and gesticulating toward the camera while filming a music video for “I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)” or “Maldito Alcohol.”

Furthermore, the report found that many single parents are having to balance their family obligations with the financial necessity of working late nights arranging diss tracks directed against Lil’ Wayne just to put food on the table, a trend that Coan called “all too typical” in the current economy.

“Over the past seven years, we’ve seen a steady decline in real median household income in the United States, which corresponds with an equally sharp rise in the number of Americans finding samples for bouncing, house-music-inspired dance hall songs, such as ‘Don’t Stop the Party’ or all the singles off the Meltdown EP,” Coan said. “And given that rent payments and food and transportation costs have only risen, it appears these individuals will simply have to continue putting in full days at one job and then immediately don white linen suits and open-collar dress shirts so they can shoot a Bud Light commercial alongside Pitbull and his entourage.”

When surveyed, most Americans confirmed they had few economic options, and stated that rapping alongside Pitbull was simply something they had to do to scrape by. However, many pointed to the unfulfilling and arduous nature of their efforts, with only a small minority of the respondents saying they receive health insurance or producer credits for their exhausting work with the Latin-American hip-hop artist.

“Between my job at a home improvement store, painting houses on the weekends, and shouting ‘Miami Beach’ through an Auto-Tune filter until I’m hoarse, I’m barely keeping my head above water,” said 42-year-old Michael Erickson of Scottsdale, AZ, who noted that he’s grateful to even have the opportunity to pick up a handful of hours with Pitbull every week given the amount of musical collaboration work that lately has gone to overseas workers or Pharrell. “Clocking out of my regular job at 5 and then flying off to Las Vegas to serve as Pitbull’s hype man at the Billboard Music Awards isn’t easy, but it’s just a sacrifice I have to make if I have any chance of paying off my mortgage.”

“It’s hard—I come home late every night soaked in champagne and I’m just too exhausted to spend time with my kids,” he continued. “But the fact is that I’m doing this so that someday they won’t have to.”",820,5051,16,98

We’ll be applying the cream in gentle, circular motions from the Bay Area down through the Sierra Nevada region and all the way up to the Oregon border. Then we’ll follow with a gentle SPF 30 setting spray to prevent further sun damage to the already crispy leaves.” Porter added that while the program is expensive, taxpayers save millions thanks to state prison inmates, who are paid $1 per acre to administer the forests’ autumn exfoliation regimen.

It’s very important to keep wearing the mask for the remainder of the pandemic, though, or you risk losing it all. Really, this is a can’t-lose proposition for any citizen smart enough to know a great deal when they see one.” Redford concluded that anyone foolish enough not to wear a mask would likely be declaring bankruptcy, filing for divorce, and searching out cures for sexual dysfunction by year’s end.

Ureña, a 30-year-old fulfillment associate, reportedly clocked out of his extended holiday hours, pushed open the Amazon warehouse doors, and immediately began wincing and coughing as his body adjusted to the toxic atmosphere of the future, with its piercing orange sky, scorching temperatures, and suffocating smog. Sources confirmed a stunned Ureña stopped dead in his tracks and stared blankly at a world filled with dilapidated, bombed-out buildings and plumes of toxic gas emerging from fissures dotted throughout the blighted hellscape.

“Hello? Does anyone know what year it is? I...I think there might have been some kind of mistake on my Christmas shift,” said an awe-struck Ureña, recoiling in fear as several Amazon-branded robotic guards, a cloaked man in a gas mask, and several teens on hover bikes zoomed by him, knocking him back. “Uh...I thought I was just going to spend the night picking up some extra hours at the fulfillment center. But I guess...something happened?”

“Hello? Hello? Is anyone there?” he added, swiping at the screen of his now non-functional cell phone, which showed thousands of missed calls and texts from friends and family. “Anybody? Please? Anybody?”

According to witnesses at the Plainfield Amazon warehouse, Ureña had reportedly put his head down to work in the year 2020 for a mandatory 10- hour bonus shift, and then was not permitted by his supervisors to eat, sleep, use the restroom, or communicate with his family, friends, or coworkers for the next three millennia. Per his timecard, Ureña had worked for over 26 million hours straight, throughout 15 violent revolutions, several nuclear wars, and countless near-human extinctions.

Over that time, sources confirmed Ureña sustained multiple back, hand, and eye injuries, which were not covered by the company’s health insurance, as he was just a contractor for those 3,000 years.

“Well, when this all started, I was just trying to do my job, but I guess none of that matters now,” said Ureña, who told reporters that his former house had been reduced to rubble, gangs of futuristic rebel fighters had taken over his neighborhood, and a crater now subsumed most of the United States. “All I wanted to do was go home and see my kids, but now everyone I know and love is long dead.”

“Why?” he added, dropping to his knees before the crumbling graves of his wife and children, surrounded by countless deceased family members he never got to meet. “Why?”

According to his supervisor at Amazon, however, Ureña reportedly did a less than satisfactory job during his extended hours, receiving three demerits for talking too much in the year 4021, nodding off on the job in 4044, and standing too close to a fellow employee in 5014. They also criticized Ureña for cutting his mandatory overtime shift short, saying he clocked out 7 minutes early and that his pay would be docked.

Asking to remain anonymous, several other Amazon employees also reported emerging from overtime shifts in the future, including a Whole Foods employee who was locked in a store freezer, only to be thawed centuries years later; as well as an Amazon delivery driver who fell asleep at the wheel, only to wake up in the year 7000 to his truck being thrashed by a large, tentacled monster.

“Honestly, I keep opening and closing my eyes, and hoping I’ll wake up from this dream,” said Ureña, going through his locker and throwing out all of his dusty, disintegrated possessions from the day his holiday shift started. “I at least thought I was going to get a promotion, title change, or maybe even just a little overtime bonus for my 40 lifetimes of work. Instead, they fired me for peeing in a bottle God knows how many thousands of years ago.”

Oftentimes, stubborn patients like Trump think they can open up their brain themselves and ensure their blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile are in perfect harmony when really, that is not the case.” At press time, physicians expressed greater concern a fter Trump released a video showing him covered in leeches and receiving an infusion of horse blood for strength.",204,1259,13,100

NEW YORK—Real estate mogul and television personality Donald Trump reportedly stood before his bedroom's full-length mirror Wednesday morning and stared forlornly at his aged, shriveled penis before getting dressed and leaving his residence in Manhattan's Trump Tower to start the day.

According to reports, the 66-year-old had laid his suit out on his bed and was preparing to step into a pair of silk boxer shorts when he glimpsed his deteriorating body in the mirror. Trump then spent approximately 15 to 20 minutes morosely reflecting on his appearance, dedicating most of that time to gazing at his desiccated sexual anatomy and contemplating its all-but-total lack of function.

""God, look at this thing,"" said a dejected Trump, hoisting up a large quantity of belly flab with his forearm to make his stunted organ visible. ""Pitiful.""

Trump, who in just over an hour would be appearing on the morning show Fox And Friends to assert that the president of the United States was not an American citizen, is said to have grasped the bulb of his penis with his thumb and forefinger and stretched the organ to its full 3-inch length before letting it go and leaving it to loll on an unruly tangle of mostly gray pubic hair. Noticing the pronounced droop of his scrotum, Trump glumly cupped his testicles in his hand and lifted them several inches until they reached the approximate height at which they had hung in his youth and even into early middle age.

Sources say Trump sat on his bed and lightly shook his head for a full five minutes.

At this point, Trump is purported to have released the heavily crinkled pouch and sighed deeply.

""What the hell happened?"" said Trump, who appeared to receive no reassurance by swiveling and viewing his shrunken penis in profile. ""It's just…dead.""

Sources confirmed Trump then received a phone call from an Associated Press reporter asking him to respond to charges that he was a ""blowhard"" and a ""bully,"" allegations Trump managed to address despite his preoccupation with the condition of his sexual organ.

""I'm rich and famous, and everyone wants to be me,"" Trump told the caller, all the while struggling to recall the last time he was able to achieve even a partial erection. ""That doesn't make me a bully. That just makes me better than most people.""

""There's never been a success story like mine in the history of America,"" continued Trump, who briefly tipped the phone away from his mouth as he licked his palm and began tugging on his penis with a loose fist. ""I'm a phenomenon, and I don't care who knows it—of course, everyone already does.""

Upon disconnecting, Trump continued to stroke vigorously for three full minutes before giving up in exhaustion.

Shortly thereafter, Trump reportedly turned his attention to the remainder of his body, miserably noting in his reflection the complete absence of muscle tone in his arms, the vast network of wrinkles on his face that showed through despite a freshly applied layer of bronzer, and the loose flesh on his neck, which he pulled taut several times with his thumbs. According to sources, Trump then attempted to shake free of his melancholy by rising to his toes in a boxing stance and pantomiming a series of punch combinations, an effort that quickly embarrassed him and intensified his gloom.

""Sixty-six years old,"" said Trump, who has an estimated fortune of $2.9 billion. ""What's 70 going to look like? And 75? What the hell am I gonna do then?""

Gazing over at the clothes neatly laid out on his bed, Trump added, ""Goddamn it.""",619,3699,16,100

You talk about all the photos of me with my eyes gouged out that are pinned to the wall with hunting knives as if it’s a story, fine, but we are unified and taking it week by week.

1,Minneapolis Announces Plan To Replace Police Officers With Thousands Of Heavily Armed Social Workers,https://www.theonion.com/minneapolis-announces-plan-to-replace-police-officers-w-1844627586,"MINNEAPOLIS—In an effort to regain the community’s trust and better allocate city resources, Mayor Jacob Frey announced Thursday that Minneapolis would dismantle its current police force and replace it with a new bureau of heavily armed social workers, effective immediately.

Advertisement

The mayor outlined a plan that dramatically restructured the municipality’s approach to public safety, replacing its nearly 850 police officers with a similar number of social workers, who would be dispatched to city streets and have at their disposal firearms, bulletproof vests, tear gas, armored vehicles with gun turrets, and other tools to enhance their service to the community.

“Minneapolis has demanded a new model of security, and so today we are reallocating the police department’s entire $193 million budget to clinical social workers, case managers, and crisis counselors,” said Frey, confirming members of the newly created bureau would be issued service weapons and assigned to one of several precincts, the heads of which would report to a chief of social work. “Why continue asking police to manage this city’s homelessness crisis, for example, when we can send in social workers—those actually trained in assisting housing-insecure people—to bulldoze our homeless camps and move the inhabitants out at gunpoint?”

“We have heard your call,” Frey added, “and rest-assured: The next time you contact the authorities, a licensed professional equipped with empathy, emotional intelligence, active listening skills, and a whole lot of firepower will be headed your way.”

Training for the new bureau reportedly includes instruction not only with Glock 20s and Colt M4 Carbines but also in takedown maneuvers, chokeholds, and baton techniques, all with the goal of enabling social workers to subdue any adversary encountered while conducting routine domestic checks, meeting with trauma survivors, or visiting a child welfare agency.

Recruits to the bureau acknowledged their work should be easier now that they have the capacity to immediately neutralize every potential threat in their path.

“As a substance abuse counselor, it’s nice to know that if one of my clients starts using again, I can just Taser them and confiscate their stash,” said 47-year-old Cindy Hughes, who holds a master of social work degree from the College of St. Scholastica in Duluth and, in addition to a stun gun and sidearm, carries a Remington 700 sniper rifle in the trunk of her squad car. “It’s so much easier than getting them to go to a meeting.”

“Usually, if I’m worried they’re trying to score, we discuss sober-living facilities and ways to avoid common relapse triggers,” Hughes continued. “Now I can make extra sure they stay off the streets by simply handcuffing them to their bunk at the halfway house.”

According to Mayor Frey, out-of-work former police officers would be eligible to join the social work bureau so long as they earned the appropriate credentials, which would allow them to bring their confrontational impulses and intimidation tactics into both outpatient behavioral health centers and foster care settings.

City officials said they also planned to disband the Minneapolis Police Canine Unit and replace it with a team of local therapy dogs, which would be trained extensively in clamping their jaws onto people’s legs and ripping apart their flesh.

Sheila Bickford, a family therapist in the city for the past 30 years, told reporters her words would carry more weight now that she could enter counseling sessions outfitted with body armor, a ballistic helmet, a riot shield, and a shotgun loaded with less-lethal rounds.

“You definitely get people’s attention when you touch down in front of their home in the Child and Family Services chopper,” said Bickford, referring to her division’s UH-60 Black Hawk military surplus helicopter. “They can either listen when I tell them codependency takes a toll on the well-being and quality of your relationships, or they can get knocked down and kicked in the head until they are completely unresponsive. It’s the easy way or the hard way.”

Added Bickford, “To anyone out there who’s struggling, let me say this: We see you, we hear you, and we are here for you, ready to compel your compliance with chemical agents or the butt of an M-16.”",690,4352,14,100

I just hope the studio can focus on the good stuff, like the story arc where the two cops finally get their new roommate a job on the force and accidentally shoot an unarmed black man.” At press time, Criswell had revised his pitch to emphasize the diversity of the cast, and how many of the storylines actually focused on Black people and immigrants.

In the meantime, we’ll go to Anderson Cooper to see if there are any new developments since air traffic controllers lost contact,” stammered Blitzer, as a sweating, visibly nervous CNN analyst John King moved from the network’s Magic Wall showing most states grayed out to a map of Southeast Asia where he marked areas that represented the flight’s trajectory and the last time it had been heard from in March 2014. “Right, so, while the search has covered around 50,000 square miles, it has so far failed to turn up more than parts of a plane’s right wing and right stabilizer that could have been part of the vanished Boeing 777 aircraft, and there’s been a whole host of controversy surrounding the Malaysian government’s response to the plane’s disappearance. While we’re, um, waiting to confirm anything on the West Coast or even get some reliable exit polling out of Michigan or Pennsylvania that might tell us which way the election is going, we’ll be hearing from an official from the International Civil Aviation Association about the likelihood a plane could go missing, and what kinds of changes have been made in aviation safety over the past six years. But first, we’re going to hear from our correspondents Arlette Saenz and Jeff Zeleny, who are waiting for any statements from the Joe Biden campaign, but in the meantime are going to reopen the case of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and explore several key developments that have happened over the past 15 years, and then, uh, depending on what’s happening in Texas, maybe Dana Bash can talk about the Carnival cruise ship from 2013 where many passengers got sick before a power outage turned the boat into a feces-covered nightmare.” The agitated Blitzer added that the network could not confirm how the Malaysia Airlines flight’s 239 passengers and crew members would have voted in the 2020 election.

Thankfully, the gaming legends at Nintendo are doing their part with their new “Switch the Polls” campaign that encourages gamers to register to vote and write in Mario for president.

Democratic engagement FTW!

Here’s how it works: Starting Saturday , October 24, all Nintendo Switch and 3DS users will receive weekly updates informing them about their local voting center, instructions on voter registration, and where to write “Mario” on a ballot to make sure everyone’s favorite plumber’s name is represented in the 2020 election. Beyond that, Nintendo will also be offering free bussing to nearby polls on November 3 in order to ensure no gamer will be prevented from voting for the iconic Italian platforming star to become president. If all goes well, we could even se e the beloved gaming icon beat out Green Party candidate Howie Hawkins!

Given the overall sense of fatigue and hopelessness that has long plagued the nation, we couldn’t be happier to see Nintendo coming out and encouraging everyone to make sure their voices are heard at the polls. After all, this is the most important election in a generation, and it’s downright inspiring to imagine millions of gamers heading to their local election center and showing the world that Mario deserves to be president of the United States. Even more impressive is Nintendo’s choice to also encourage down ballot voting with an ad campaign telling fans to cast their vote in state and local races for Shy Guys. So cool!



Frankly, we think this is a long overdue stand for the iconic console maker. After all, we live in a democracy that requires active participation from all gamers in order for it to continue being healthy and robust. We’re also encouraged that Nintendo is putting their money where their mouth is and telling fans that if Mario doesn’t receive at least 3% of the vote, then the election has been rigged and the director of the FEC should be assassinated.

Now that’s the sort of commitment to democracy that we all love to see!",370,2190,17,101

We must rise up against this government tyranny, because they have no right to stop any Floridian from making the journey to the Kaaba. In fact, we are encouraging all Florida residents to assert their right to perform the rites of the hajj in the holy city of Mecca and enjoy their constitutional freedom to properly honor Muhammad. We will also challenge any mosque that prohibits entry because a Florida resident isn’t wearing a mask.” State officials added that if any Floridian gets coronavirus from their hajj, it was simply because Allah has willed it.",226,1412,15,102

Personally, I think it’d be prudent to assign her to the Agriculture, Ethics, Small Business, Foreign Affairs, Homeland Security, and Armed Services committees. Maybe put her on some Senate committees too. Whatever it takes to keep her occupied.” An hour after a House vote was scheduled to remove Greene from her committees, sources confirmed she had already tweeted out a theory that climate change was caused by secret Muslims running extension cords up to the Arctic Circle and placing space heaters near all the biggest glaciers.

Soaring ahead of its competition, the PS5 is a game-changing next- generation console that Santa just can’t afford right now, okay, S port?

Sadly, things are a little tight money-wise in Santa’s Workshop at the moment, C hamp, if that makes sense.



Building on the success of the PS4, the gigantic new console pushes gaming to a whole new level, utilizing an AMD-powered GPU that can process 10.28 teraflops for the most immersive user experience to date. Santa would simply love to get one for you, Slugger, if the economy wasn’t so bad right now that it’s even affecting the North Pole.

Perhaps most impressive of all the PS5 ’ s features is its DualSense controller, whose minimalist aesthetic belies a sophisticated interface with greatly improved haptic feedback that allows you to feel as though you’re really there with every raindrop, or at least, you would feel that way if the bank could have just cut Santa some slack with interest payments on his magical sled.

Preloaded with the enjoyable, if not revolutionary, platformer Astro’s Playroom, which serves mostly as a demo reel of the console’s newest technologies, there are actually two editions of the system available: one including a 4K Blu-ray drive with a price tag of $499, and the slimmer Digital Edition, which at $100 less is still too big an expense for Santa what with all the payments for someone to babysit all of his reindeer and little elves.

Of course, the PS5 is not completely perfect. There are some noticeable flubs here and there, including an overreliance on outmoded options menus and a counterintuitive home button configuration, so no need to cry, Buddy, huh? It’s not because of anything you did. You’ve been so good this year! Santa still loves you very, very much, and I promise there’s so much other fun other stuff you’re going to get this year that you won’t even miss the PlayStation, honest!



Remember how much you like Air Bud? Well, let’s just say ol’ Saint Nick got his hands on the DVDs for a few sequels this holiday season.

Thanks to its impressive engineering, backwards compatibility, and exciting pipeline of new titles showing off exactly what the next-gen is all about, we’re sure the PS5 is going to be around for quite a while. So dry your eyes, Chief, and think about how much more you’ll appreciate the system when you get it for your birthday next year or maybe next Christmas depending on how a couple of Santa’s job interviews pan out.

Obviously, this might just be the Sambuca talking, but Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is an energetic spin on the battle royale genre that everyone should try out.

No, we’ll go farther than that. If we were dead sober, we probably wouldn’t have the stones to say something like this. But it’s just something we feel like we need to say: Fall Guys is a more- than- welcome addition to the last man standing mechanics that sparkles with polish and an addictive gameplay loop.

Look, we know a lot of people said the popular battle royale formula was played out, and we’re obviously a little tipsy right now to boot. But what the hell, y’know? Our tongue is a little loosened by all that ’ buca and what Fall Guys does best is dress up a tried-and-true formula with vibrant visuals and just enough platformer innovation to keep you coming back for more. God, who even ordered that last round?

Gamers, this is a time when we can really just be us, and this is a safe space because we trust you, which is why we’re willing to open up and say we love the way Fall Guys exchanges the typical battle royale violence for a unique sense of cartoon whimsy. It just feels like everything is coming together for us tonight if that makes sense. It’s funny how that happens, huh?



Have you ever had Sambuca before, gamers? It’s anise liquor or something like that. It’s not really good per se, but it’s unique and kind of addicting, not unlike Fall Guys’ level design.

Hold on. We should put something in the stomach just to absorb the alcohol before we talk about the delightful rag-doll physics. It was, like, $24 for this big tapas thing, but it’s going to be worth it tomorrow morning. We didn’t have lunch, so these shots were really going to our head. You don’t mind if we keep telling you about Fall Guys while we chow down, right? Man, these polpette meatball things are so good.

Anyway, gamers, we’re pretty wasted at this point. That’s probably clear already. But these shots and Peroni keep coming our way, and we’d feel like dicks refusing. Ugh. What were we even saying?

Yikes. This is looking bad for Luigi, gamers.



The catastrophe unfolded on Wednesday at around 4 a.m. as Luigi slept soundly on the futon in his studio apartment in Toad Town. Ignoring all safety warnings, the platforming icon apparently left his space heater running and unattended for days on end, only to be awoken by a rush of flame and smoke from a nearby tissue paper-based toadstool. Within minutes, The Origami Kings’ paper world was engulfed in an outright conflagration that stretched from Chestnut Road to Sweetpaper Valley.



Sadly, despite the best efforts of Toads and the Cheeps Cheeps to combat the blaze with water and wind, the inferno was uncontrollable. Now, due to Luigi’s outright negligence, Paper Mario’s world is a literal tinderbox, leaving thousands dead and the Mushroom Kingdom’s survivors struggling to rebuild the charred remains of their life.

We here at OGN have always loved Luigi, but even we must now agree that someone must put an end to his ineptitudes. While some will say this was only an accident, ignorance is no excuse when it comes to destruction and mayhem like this. For this reason, we’re joining the widespread call for his arrest. Hopefully a few years locked in the deepest depths of Bowser’s Castle will help him come to terms with what he’s done and finally give him the kick in the ass he needs to do something with his life.",308,1819,19,108

But we also want to make sure kids know more.

For years now, over 70% of NBA draft first-rounders have been evaluated solely off word of mouth from these hundreds of encounters.” The report added that if these prospects are juking around broken-down tractor parts while liste ning to a poorly produced mixtape, they are immediately offered NBA max contracts.

On the other hand, though, maybe it’s the stress of a news cycle in which people from both political parties are invested in a series of increasingly baroque conspiracy theories guided by the grotesque and increasingly obvious lies we tell ourselves about American exceptionalism that’s making me feel kind of sad. There’s just this nagging feeling I have that it became very clear over the past 12 months that the basic building blocks of society are crumbling and there is absolutely no plan for changing anything at any level to avoid plunging the vast majority of humanity into cycles of ever-worsening suffering and violence. Maybe it’s just that being fundamentally powerless and living among other similarly disenfranchised, surveilled, and downtrodden people have made me feel completely alienated from any kind of community at all, or maybe I just need to get more sleep.” Carpenter added that he did plan to address the way he’d been feeling lately, perhaps by tuning out of the news and letting other people who weren’t ever even afforded the option to believe in the illusions of American society figure out what to do, or by trying to exercise more.

Really, the bulging vein on his forehead is what gives him away, along with the few million other Americans who look just like him.” At press time, Bowdich had confirmed that the plethora of written and video evidence of the man posted on social media also meant the FBI believed they could start questioning suspects by mid-2022.

After getting off the phone with a representative at DuPont, it turns out that 9.8 pounds of silicon and plastic is way more affordable than we assumed, meaning you can own the quantity of materials that make up an Xbox Series X for a mere $8.27!

Looks like Christmas came early for any gamers looking to buy the constituent components making up the hottest ticket of this holiday system!



Sure, Microsoft’s latest and greatest console might be backordered at every electronics store in the country, but that’s no excuse for not owning the basic materials that form its semiconductors and casing—and at a fraction of the cost! In fact, if you buy it wholesale at scale—we’re talking 200 to 300 pounds of silicon—you can get it for even cheaper. Of course, owning five palettes of industrial-grade silicon might be a bit much for the average gamer, but for the right person, it would mean having the equivalent of 30 Xbox Series Xs. Think about that!

Just imagine the look your friends will have when you invite them over to check out your new Xbox and you point out the pallet of chemical materials sitting on your entertainment center. Heck, you could even take a welding class for only an additional $125 or so at the local adult education center, and then you’re almost all the way to owning this face-melting graphical powerhouse. Assuming you get some sort of engineering degree, you could even melt the plastic down in an industrial furnace, form it into a shape approximating the real thing, and paint it matte black. Pretty cool, huh?

It’s enough to put a smile on any Microsoft fanboy or fangirl’s face!

Plus, Halo Infinite might not even be out yet, but the polycarbonate that its 4K Blu-Ray is made out of only costs $1.90 per pound. Picture the jealousy in your best bud’s eyes when you pull out a handful of that, point to it, and say, “T his could be Master Chief’s next adventure and it’s all mine! ” Really, all you’d have to do is carve the polycarbonate into 0.6 MM layers, then use a laser to inscribe it in just the right way and you’d be well on your way to getting the first-ever playable copy of 343 Industry’s next sci-fi epic in the whole world!

But jump on this deal quick, gamers! Once people catch wind that they could be getting their hands on a real-life approximation of the Series X for pennies on the dollar, they’re going to be standing in line outside every raw material supplier’s warehouse in the country. Heck, we’ll say it. This is the most exciting time for video games since we learned back in the ’ 80s that all you have to do is rearrange a few billion cells in your body and you’d become Shigeru Miyamoto.",496,2766,22,110

For too long, Americans have been divided by medians, stayed in their bubbles of turnpikes or bus lanes or private driveways, and it is time for that to end. Whether you’re on a cul-de-sac, a frontage road, a lane, a restricted byway, or Interstate 90, you should be able to drive to the middle of the country, enter the 100-mile roundabout I have planned, and merge onto any other avenue, trunk road, or corniche that this country has to offer. Once we all travel across the country and meet up in the intersection’s rest stop to get gas and pick out something from one of the vending machines, I think we’ll realize that we’re not so different after all.” At press time, the senators were voting unanimously to confirm Buttigieg after he outlined his plans to expand the big, beautiful American intersection to include every railroad track, airstrip, and shipping lane in the country.

You are just testing me, Lord, and I know that, but I am going to need a little bit of divine help to understand this one.” At press time, Carson was praising the Lord for his guidance after remembering that the hysterectomies were completely justified because President Donald Trump was a divine being simply carrying out God’s will.

But one nagging mystery—the story behind the protagonist’s iconic tattoos—remained unsolved. That is until today, when iO Interactive confirmed a long-rumored theory that scanning Agent 47’s barcode would bring up a can of Del Monte Whole Green Beans.

That’s right. Some of Hitman’s most rabid fans might have guessed it. For the rest of us, though? Mind. Blown.

“Since the series started way back in 2000, we’ve constantly heard from gamers telling us their pet theories about how Agent 47 got his infamous barcode,” said series director Christian Elverdam in a livestream revealing the long-suspected series secret. “Some people thought it had to do with his past links to an international criminal syndicate. Others even thought that 47 got the tattoo while being cloned in some sort of underground laboratory. I don’t know where they think up this stuff.”



“The answer is simple: 47 ’ s neck can be rung up to purchase a can of Del Monte Whole Green Beans for $1.99,” he added.

According to Elverdam, iO Interactive excitedly followed fan theories as they piled up over the years, expressing delight at the way gamers honed in on E aster eggs such as a throwable can of green beans in 2012 ’ s Hitman: Absolution or the countless appearance of Del Monte products in the Miami mission of 2018 ’ s Hitman 2. While several Reddit users came tantalizingly close recently with speculation that Agent 47 ’ s neck could be used to purchase a can of Hormel Baked Beans, it wasn’t until today that the full truth could be appreciated in all its glory.

“What we want fans to imagine is a supermarket cashier slowly sliding Agent 47 ’ s neck over a checkout scanner,” added Elverdam. “Maybe he has to do it four or fives times because the laser is broken and knocks 47 ’ s head against the checkout counter’s metal lip. But when it works, a little line that reads ‘Del Monte Cut GB 28oz’ pops up on the register screen.”

“There’s also this two-for-one deal where you can get any other Del Monte canned vegetable of equal or lesser value for free if you use Agent 47,” he added. “I should have mentioned that before. Sorry.”

It all seems so obvious in retrospect! But we’ve got to admit that this mystery had us stumped until today. Thankfully, this massive reveal just gives us more reason than ever to go back to the beginning of the series and experience Agent 47 ’ s incredible story all over again. Now that’s the kind of pleasant surprise we love to see!

Plus then you’ll eventually get to the third season, which is absolutely the golden age of The Flintstones. But those classic episodes like the Fraternal Order of the Water Buffaloes Convention in Frantic City and the heartrending one where Fred hires Lollobrickida the French maid wouldn’t resonate as deeply if it hadn’t been for the careful foundation the Flintstones writers built back in season one. Just wait until season four, when Barney Rubble really comes into his own as a character. Honestly, I’m jealous that you get to watch it for the first time.” North assured his friend that if he stuck with The Flintstones he would also finally understand all the memes their other friends were constantly sending in the group chat.

This is the thought police spitting in the face of our collective heritage.

That’s right, gamers: ancient Greece, Shakespeare, the Cathedral of Notre Dame—apparently none of that means anything to the social justice warriors over at Maxis. It used to be that we celebrated people like Isaac Newton or Thomas Aquinas, but apparently left-wing radicals are too dedicated to carping on about social justice to let the simple words “Western Civilization” unlock 100,000 simoleans. That’s the fallen world we live in today, brought to you by the cowards at EA.

There is nothing bigoted about celebrating all the wonders that Europeans have accomplished. But to spineless weakling Will Wright, everything associated with the accomplishments of an entire continent’s culture must automatically be thrown down the memory hole. That’s why typing “Western Civilization” into the chat box prompts zero rewards: no unlocked decor, no free satisfaction points. And that holds true no matter how many times you type in “Judeo-Christian Heritage” or “The Renaissance.” Apparently, facts are not politically correct anymore! Who knew?

Hey, but we’re willing to bet that typing in “Mohammad” unlocks every building lot in the game since that’s the only word leftist moral crusaders want you to be able to say these days!

Gamers, we must put an end to this plague of political correctness. Hitting the tilde key and typing “Western Civilization” into its console should be enough for a significant resource boost or access to God mode, at the very least. This is our history we are talking about. Stand up and let Maxis know you won’t let them denigrate you like this any longer!",352,2135,19,112

Instead of attacking by calling me ‘a clown stripped of his clothes,’ he should have started with an ‘I’ statement. This is how the Chinese Communist Party has operated for nearly 100 years, and he knows that. Hopefully, this case can serve as an example to other dissidents thinking about criticizing my regime without first praising my work ethic.” At press time, Xi added his critics should always feel welcome to privately talk one-on-one with him.

WASHINGTON—Declaring that they were closer than ever to reaching a mutually satisfying result, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced Friday a meeting to put the finishing touches on a 1,000-piece ‘ Starry Night’ jigsaw puzzle. “We are pleased that, after months of tense negotiations, we’re on the verge finishing this terrific puzzle of one of Van Gogh’s most critically important works,” said Mnuchin and Pelosi in a joint statement, adding that they had made a major breakthrough in assembling the pieces of the village and hoped the finished puzzle would reflect the enormous amount of work put into it by dozens of members of the Trump administration and Democratic House leadership. “We really want to get his puzzle done before the election, but it’s also important not to rush things and jam pieces of the night sky together that don’t actually fit. It’s true that we hoped to get the puzzle done faster when we started in June, but even working on it day and night, it takes time to assemble so many pieces. There are still some sticking points, like whether a few of the border pieces are lost for good or whether they’re just in a couch cushion somewhere in the Oval Office, but as soon as we find those and finish the cypress tree, we’ll be all ready to present it to the public.” Pelosi and Mnuchin admitted that it still might be hard to reach an agreement with Senate Republicans, who so far had rejected the offers of doing a puzzle entirely and seemed unlikely to agree to anything except a game of Risk.

After years of hype around Sucker Punch’s upcoming open-world epic Ghost Of Tsushima, we learned today from an insider source that the main character is a direct rip-off of a warrior from Japanese history known as the “samurai.”

This brazen theft is a disappointing revelation, and one that will make enjoying this title difficult, if not impossible.

What makes this even harder to take is that when we first saw previews of the Infamous and Sly Cooper developer’s latest release, we were absolutely blown away by the creativity that had gone into crafting the game’s fictional world. Every detail—from the so-called Bushido code of ethics to the weapon known as the tanto—appeared to be novel innovations showcasing the studio’s knack for worldbuilding. Sadly, however, we have now discovered that everything from the game’s aesthetic to its core conceit of attacking other soldiers with swords is nothing more than a halfhearted copy of this little-known class of Japan’s medieval hereditary nobility.

Of course, it was natural for Sucker Punch to assume no one would notice that they had cribbed innumerable details about the so-called “samurai” from Japan’s history. After all, words like “katana” and “ninja” are long forgotten in Japan. Meanwhile, the average American couldn’t even guess at their meaning, let alone connect them with a class of sword-wielding Japanese soldiers committed to loyalty to their feudal lord above all else. Frankly, it’s the same liberty that Rockstar Games took in plundering America’s history for the idea of “cowboys” in Red Dead Redemption, which, lest we forget, was based upon an oft-overlooked cohort of real-life outdoorsman and herders from the nineteenth century.

With all of this said, Sucker Punch should be applauded for rescuing the samurai from the dustbin of history. It must have been exhilarating to the game’s creators to open some dusty Japanese history book and realize the gameplay potential these forgotten swordsmen might have. Who knows? In the future, we might even see movies, books, and even other video games based on the fascinating idea of blade-wielding Japanese warriors dedicated to the martial virtues and an unflinching approach to pain. Let’s just hope the artists using these ideas remember to cite their sources!",373,2346,18,114

1,Bill Simmons Ventures Into Interdimensional Vortex To Find Out If LeBron James Could Dominate In Different NBA Eras,https://sports.theonion.com/bill-simmons-ventures-into-interdimensional-vortex-to-f-1819576589,"THE MULTIVERSE—Aiming to settle the longstanding debate over LeBron James’ place within basketball history, Grantland editor-in-chief Bill Simmons reportedly stepped into an interdimensional vortex Thursday to determine if the Miami Heat star would have dominated in other NBA eras.

Reports confirmed the longtime ESPN columnist created various ripples in the fabric of space-time and opened the door to an infinite cascade of universes in which James matched up against the best players from each period of NBA history.

“We can already label LeBron as the best player of his generation—that debate is all but over—but the big question is whether he would have been the top guy during the way more physical, pre-hand-check-rule NBA,” said Simmons, who reportedly warped through a cluster of dark matter to watch James face off against the Chicago Bulls in the 1991 Eastern Conference Finals as a member of Chuck Daly’s Detroit Pistons. “He just wouldn’t get the calls back then that he gets in 2014.”

“That said, even with players literally getting clotheslined while driving to the basket, LeBron is big enough and strong enough to cope with the physicality of the ’90s,” continued Simmons, carefully watching as James received the ball from Isaiah Thomas and then darted through Scottie Pippen and Bill Cartwright for a heavily contested dunk. “But I still can’t see him winning more than two championships while the Bulls were at their peak. He’d win, but he wouldn’t have a dynasty.”

Pinning the four-time MVP against a variety of iconic players such as Bill Russell, Jerry West, and Larry Bird, Simmons reportedly vibrated his subatomic particles through a number of time streams and planes of reality, enabling the sports columnist to venture across any conceivable point within limitless parallel universes in order to appraise the theoretical scenarios in person.

“LeBron is, in a lot of ways, the most complete player we’ve ever seen, especially in terms of pure physical attributes and basketball IQ,” Simmons said as every molecule in his body gradually materialized in the mouth of a Lorentzian traversable wormhole that opened courtside at the Forum in 1985. “And based on how he’s holding his own against Kareem [Abdul-Jabbar], who’s arguably the toughest player to guard ever, there’s no doubt that he would have been a powerhouse during the Magic-Bird era of the ’80s.”

Sources indicated that Simmons then manipulated the universal wave function to enter an isolated pocket dimension where Oscar Robertson, his body retroactively strengthened by modern 21st-century training methods and diet regimens, narrowly lost to James in a one-on-one game held in an endless expanse of empty white space. However, while occupying a Hubble volume within the Level III multiverse hypothesized by Dr. Max Tegmark, the 44-year-old sports writer reportedly questioned whether James would have been as prolific a scorer in the 1960s after seeing the 1964 Boston Celtics beat the 2012 Miami Heat in a 1010,000,000-game series.

“No one is questioning his skills, but he just doesn’t have that killer instinct that Jordan had,” Simmons said as a team of five 28-year-old Michael Jordans defeated five 28-year-old LeBron Jameses—a discovery that led the Grantland editor-in-chief to conclude that the Jordans were “clearly playing in full-blown ‘Eff You’ mode.” “LeBron’s definitely in the conversation of best player ever, but MJ is still at the top of the pyramid.”

“At the end of the day, Jordan is the CT to LeBron’s Adam on The Challenge—there’s only going to be one winner in a head-to-head matchup,” added Simmons, the dissonant echoes of his voice repeating at various octaves in an infinite, crescendoing loop.

According to reports, Simmons continued to venture into increasingly divergent quantum branches, at one point watching James record two touchdowns and 131 yards as a wide receiver for the Cleveland Browns during a regular-season loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Simmons reportedly went on to later—as well as earlier and simultaneously—travel at the speed of light along an arcwise-connected manifold and enter a timeline in which John F. Kennedy survived Lee Harvey Oswald’s 1963 assassination attempt and where a James-led Team USA subsequently won gold over the Soviet Union at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Baghdad.

“LeBron is obviously a Pantheon-level guy who would have been an All-Star in any decade,” said Simmons, his very being and consciousness spreading apart along a 26-dimensional space comprised of bosonic strings. “But the fact remains that he struggled to take ‘alpha dog’ status from Wilt Chamberlain when they played together on the San Francisco Warriors, and he was Robin to Jabari Parker’s Batman when the Milwaukee Bucks won their second straight championship in 2017.”

Buyer beware! Some people will do anything for a quick buck, even if it means ripping off gamers at their most emotionally vulnerable hour.

“All I wanted to do was play Cyberpunk 2077 and maybe check out the Demon’s Souls remake, and instead, I’m out 1,200 bucks and don’t even know where to put this thing,” said Friedman, sitting in his living room in front of the massive seven-and-a-half- foot- tall work that showcases the Latvian American artist’s mature later period. “At first, when I pulled [Rothko’s masterpiece] out of the box, I thought it was just packing material, and the PlayStation and copies of Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla and Sackboy were way at the bottom. But the longer I looked, the more it dawned on me: The only thing I got was this stupid painting.”

“God, I feel like such a sucker,” he continued, sighing as he gazed back at the mid-century masterpiece of abstract expressionism.



Boy, we’ve heard some horror stories out there about gamers being duped in their quest for next-gen glory, but it’s still painful imagining Friedman’s excitement turning to disappointment as he realized he’d lost over a thousand dollars on this prime example of Rothko’s somber but evocative expressionism. Worse still, the eBay seller has gone cold and isn’t responding to any refund requests, leaving Friedman stuck with this eyesore out back in his dumpster until the junk guys come to haul it away.

So be careful out there, gamers! It might be tempting to fork over money online in the hope of joining the next-generation, but you could wind up with nothing but a painting worth $87 million to compensate you for your effort. That’s something no self-respecting gamer would ever want.",359,2177,21,115

I’m not a huge supporter of Islam, but on the other hand, I really liked what Muhammad was saying. Hmm, this is a toughie,” said the vice president, attempting to weigh his desire for political power against his strict commitment to Evangelical Christianity, which were seemingly unable to coexist in the vision of the future brought forth by the sacred prophet and founder of Islam. “Maybe it was just Jesus disguised as the prophet Muhammad and he was trying to test my faith. But then, does that mean it’s not my fate to be president? I guess I could convert to Islam for a few days just to claim my destiny and then convert right back to Christianity. I mean, Islam and Christianity are actually kind of similar when you think about it, right?” At press time, Pence had decided to split the difference between the two religions and converted to Judaism.",220,1262,18,115

I’m already a week old. I can’t pretend I know everything, but life’s too short to be scared of every new experience. Sure, that’s a lot of bodies, but there’s also a lot of wonderful honey.

Oh yes, we do. What is it, you may be wondering? Well, get ready, because it’s going to knock your socks off: After pulling some strings, we are pleased to announce that the common loon Gavia immer is now officially the gaming bird!

Yep, that’s right. Thanks to our connections, the bird known as the Great Northern Diver has now been sanctioned as the avian ambassador for PC and console users alike.

You’re welcome, readers. Don’t say we’ve never done anything for you.

How did we do it, you ask? How did we manage to get the monogamous, crustacean-eating Nearctic waterfowl appointed as the official gaming bird? Well, having spent decades as the i nternet’s premiere website for video game journalism, we’ve made some friends in high places. Let’s just say we reached out to our people at the Audubon Society, called in a few favors from some old business associates at the World Wildlife Fund for Nature, and, well, we managed to work something out.

That’s not important, though. What is important is that the common loon, with its vibrant plumage and highly adept fishing skills, is now a certified symbol for gamers around the world, from JRPG fans to Battle Royale esports champions and everyone in between, and you have us to thank for it.

We could’ve settled for the yellow-rumped warbler or the northern cardinal, but no. We wanted only the best for you, gamers. Sure, we may have had to grease some palms and scratch some backs, but don’t go worrying your pretty little heads about all of that. We have our ins, and we’ll use them for you. We live to serve our friends, after all.

Now, every time you hear the magnificent tremolo call of the common loon or see one building a nest out of dead marsh grass, you can feel comfortable knowing that this creature, in all its glory, represents gamers like you.

Okay, look, to be totally honest, gamers, there’s a little bit more about this deal that we haven’t let you in on. Apparently, one of the loans we took out to pay off a WWF officials was linked to the Kurdish m afia. Who knew, right? Anyway, we may have pissed off some of the wrong people while working out this deal and we may need to lam it for a bit in Peru. But still, we’d be lying if we said it wasn’t worth getting in over our heads a bit in exchange for securing such a magnificent specimen as the official gaming bird.

Speaking for all my colleagues, we absolutely want to challenge Trump in real time to expose the extensive falsehoods and shocking offensiveness of his statements, but when you’re actually there in the room with him, you’re lucky if you’re able to squeak out even a weak ‘hummina hummina hummina.’” The awestruck D.C. journalists added that they had no idea how Swan managed to take a piece of paper from Trump and critique it right then and there instead of sliding to the floor after catching a whiff of the president’s animal scent.

Incredibly, though, we failed to pick up on this little Easter egg until today: You can actually press L3 to have a nice conversation with the game’s bosses and enemies. And you know what, gamers? It turns out that they’re all pretty nice.

That’s right! Like us, you may have found yourself bashing your head against the wall struggling to defeat lumbering Penetrators or relentless waves of Silver Skeletons. But if you just choose to holster your Battle Axe, you can instead casually chat with these enemies about what they’re up to this weekend or where to grab a good burrito in the Valley of Defilement. Turns out, if you just act like a nice guy—instead of a bloodthirsty maniac—every “enemy” in the game will simply let you pass without so much as lifting a finger.

“ Don’t judge a book by its cover” is really the name of the game in Demon’s Souls.



Put simply, most gamers have been completely misreading the aggressive body language and menacing appearance of Demon’s Souls enemies. While so many of us instinctively drew our weapons as a Red Eye Knight charged our way, the truth is they just want to talk to you about your favorite entry in the Mission Impossible franchise. Admittedly, it’s banal and can get pretty boring after the Knight keeps telling you that Philip Seymour Hoffman’s performance in MI:III is underappreciated. But by simply trying to have a conversation instead of killing these supposed adversaries, you’ll find out you have a lot more in common with them than you initially thought.



One neat feature is that there’s actually a whole dialogue wheel system, if you hold down L3 for five seconds or so. By utilizing the “joke” and “charm” options in succession we actually found out we share a love of amateur photography with the Storm King and went out on a nice date with him in the Shrine of Storms. It didn’t go anywhere, romantically, but it really makes us wonder what we’ve missed out on by being so dismissive in the past.



So there you have it, gamers! It turns out many of Demon’s Souls creatures share the same values we have, and yet we’ve been murdering them indiscriminately for over a decade. Frankly, we feel terrible about killing so many of them. But for anyone who loves Soulsborne games, we can’t think of a better reason to jump back in and replay this classic from the very beginning!",452,2600,22,117

Its provisions dictate that the president can sidestep any checks and balances on his power once he has abused his authority so many times that no one can keep track anymore.” Trump added that while his opponents may try to challenge his executive order in court, the loophole also states that by then he will have achieved his immediate political aims.",204,1267,18,117

In fact, this open-world RPG from CD Projekt Red is probably one of the things that has kept you going through this tough year.

It was just something we made up to sound cool and interesting in front of you so you would like us and now that lie is spinning completely out of control.

Please don’t hate us.

Now, we’re sure your mad. We know you were counting down the days until you could explore a fully realized Night City as part of the ultra-customizable gameplay you’ve been seeing in hands-on videos for months. But it’s a lie. It’s all a goddamn lie and we’re sorry. We just really like when you hang out on the site, and we wanted you to stick around. That’s why we made it up way back in 2012 and got the developer to play along.

This started as a dumb little fib about something we thought you would like and now it’s become this huge weight on our chest, getting heavier and heavier every day. We just couldn’t keep it down anymore without having a panic attack.



We know what you are thinking. The screenshots? The previews? Our art department created it all. We thought we could keep up the charade for a year or two more with a trickle of delays and impressions about the gangs, the dynamic police system, all of it. But in the back of our heads, we always knew that one day, you would expect this game to come out and we would be caught.



Some of this is on you. Why do you think it’s been delayed so many times? We flirted with the idea of canceling it all together, saying CD Projekt Red had gone bankrupt or something. But then we would have never been free from the manacles of this lie.



We were just insecure, you know? There are so many video game sites out there and we’ve always kind of felt like outcasts. Talking about Cyberpunk was the first time we ever really felt like we were part of something, like you actually wanted to hear what we had to say. In a way we wanted it to be real—the customizable weapons and slow-motion combat sequences. It all sounded so cool and we didn’t want to let you down. Please don’t blame us. After all, our intentions were good.

We did this for you, even if we only ended up hurting you.

To be fair you probably should have figured it out years ago. The idea of a sci-fi shooter from the makers of The Witcher series was always a bit of a wish fulfillment fantasy wasn’t it? Obviously, we’re not trying to absolve ourselves of this. But we kind of assumed you would catch on when we claimed Keanu Reeves was going to be in the game. That doesn’t make any sense if you just think about it for a second. But we just blurted it out a few months ago, and then all it took was hiring him for a few press appearances and we were in the clear again.

At least, until now.



So, listen, what we are trying to say is: We’re very sorry. This video game is never going to come out. It doesn’t ev en exist. Of course, we understand if you never trust us again to deliver honest coverage of the industry. On the plus side, getting this all out there makes us feel like we can finally breathe again without hating ourselves. We’re sure you’ll need some time to process this, and we could use a little time to ourselves to figure out why we’re like this.

I worked hard all my life to get that ball, and that large black linebacker—or maybe he was even a defensive end—ripped it out of my hands and just ran away. Meanwhile, I got shoved to the ground and not only did no one intervene, but the other black men around him started cheering. Where the heck was law enforcement? I could’ve been killed. It was just clear they have no respect for me, the grandson of World War II veterans. Honestly, since then I’ve been afraid to even leave the pocket.” Brees added that if the country was going to have a conversation about police brutality, it also needed to address the anti-white organizations that paid large black men huge sums of money to attack innocent quarterbacks like himself.

Hell yeah, gaming aficionados! There looks to be a bright spot on the horizon for gamers everywhere after dozens of accusers have come forward against esports all-star Elton Tapowski (AKA SpytF1re) for unmentionable comments, verbal abuse, and inappropriate advances. Hordes of online commentators are already claiming you never really know what went on in cases like this, and that we should give him a pass! Folks, it’s like he’s an honest-to-god A-lister!



While you’d expect this response from the fans of a popular comedian, actor, or athlete, getting to see supporters claim that we have to separate the art from the artist—or that SpytF1re should get a lifetime pass for his incredible speedrun of Donkey Kong Country—shows just how far gaming have come.

It’s remarkable to think that even 5 or 10 years ago, SpytF1re’s unconscionable behavior would have been easily ascribed to a gamer’s creepy, basement-dwelling personality, and he might have even faced consequences. Today, though, taking actions that endangered the emotional and physical safety of another human being is quietly dismissed or outright ignored as though he’s just as valuable to society as a famous novelist or painter.



And if that wasn’t enough, esports fans are now taking it upon themselves to call Spytf1re’s accusers liars who are just trying to take down a good man for the attention and that they should kill themselves. If this sort of response, is any indication, it looks like the future of gaming is bright! Nice going, gamers!",314,1926,21,118

After yesterday’s ultra-hyped Playstation 5 press event, Sony reviewed player feedback and just announced they will be canceling their entire lineup of next-generation games in response to @NicoBoy95’s devastating comment that “No one cares” on their livestream.

Oof. Looks like it’s back to the drawing board for every single game on the gaming giant’s upcoming console.



“We saw NicoBoy95’s harsh, but ultimately correct, takedown of our presentation and decided the only wise course of action was to scrap everything we were planning and start from scratch,” said Sony Interactive president Jim Ryan, who told OGN that even third-party games like NBA 2K21 have been permanently shelved until the company can figure out a way forward that is acceptable to NicoBoy95. “Seeing this comment appear in the chat box on YouTube during the stream was a real wake-up call. To hear that nobody cares about these games is heartbreaking, especially after how hard we worked on them.”



“But it’s feedback we need to act on, not ignore,” he added.

This may be tough news for people who were actually pumped to play Horizon: Forbidden West, Deathloop, or the new Ratchet & Clank, but gamers do not say things like “No one cares” unless they believe deeply that these are the truths game makers desperately need to know.



“Frankly, I was up all night just thinking about what we could have done wrong to garner this sort of reaction,” Ryan continued, noting that it was a tough pill to swallow knowing that millions of hours of work from thousands of artists, programmers, and engineers would have to be thrown away. “Still, as painful as it’s been for us to delete hundreds of teraflops of games from our servers—games that we thought were pretty good—it’s up to us to satisfy all of our fans. And so I thank NicoBoy95 for his honesty.”



“Hopefully we can rectify this dismal failure and have a stronger lineup for release by 2025,” he continued.

Hurry up! This is a deal that’s too good to miss!

We’re talking Red, Yellow, Blue, Purple, White, Rock and Flying Pikmin, sliced up and ready for your enjoyment! So drop whatever you’re doing and come on by the Nintendo Gaming Experience to get an absolutely free, no-questions-asked sample. And if you’re worried about trying such an exotic cut of meat, don’t worry! These are flame-grilled, beautifully seasoned, and butchered into perfectly bite-sized cubes, so you won’t even imagine a Pikmin’s cute little face while you’re chowing down.

Admittedly, there’s a certain crunch to the Pikmin meat that might be a bit unnerving if this is your first time. That’s from their tiny bones and inner tendons, which aren’t removed in most traditional preparations. After you understand that, you’ll realize those crunchier and chewier components actually lend a nice textural component. And the meat’s flavor? It has this sweet and savory mix that you’ve got to experience for yourself to believe.

If you want to get really adventurous, there are also a few Bulbmin samples, too. But watch out! One out of every hundred preparations is supposed to be poisonous.

As an added incentive, the Nintendo employees are also providing wine pairings for the first 50 attendees. That really helps wash down the gamier taste of these half-plant, half-animal bites. They’re also offering complimentary silk cloth s to cover your face if you want to avoid offending G od with this culinary trespass against the laws of nature. Just remember, they’re flying off the sample tray, so get on over here for your own bite of these little critters as soon as you can!",345,2046,24,122

It is not an exaggeration to say that the history of mathematics was radically changed the moment they came into contact with this sorry ass fuck.” Cornish went on to explain that this ancient Sumerian loser was so powerfully vacuous, that word of his lameness later spread across the globe to the Mayans, the Indians, and the Europeans.

But even the most hardcore fan is going to be amazed by the developer’s recent reveal that every demon you fight in the sequel Doom Eternal went to hell for masturbating as a teenager.

That’s right! id Software just confirmed that all the hellspawn you must slay in order to protect Earth were originally condemned to the fires of hell for all eternity for pleasuring themselves to fashion catalogs and softcore Cinemax pornography in their formative years.

“We know there’s been speculation about the origin of the demonic forces in Doom, so we’re excited to officially confirm fan theories that the game’s antagonists were given their ghastly forms as punishment for getting sexually aroused by a Victoria’s Secret advertisement while they were home sick from school,” series director Hugo Martin told OGN, noting that antagonists such as the Arachnotron had been imbued with a hideous spider-like form for staying up late in eighth grade to watch the scrambled Spice channel in his bedroom.

Martin went on to note that—while not in any way referenced in-game—the studio designed elaborate onanism-based backstories for every single demonic foe that you kill, stressing that the stronger the demon, the more they sinned against God by committing the sin of self-pleasure. For example, he indicated that the three Hell Priests each separately torrented Hustler videos on the family’s shared computer as 13-year-olds, before giving up and masturbating into a tube sock.

“One of the enemies we’re most proud of is the leader of the Maykrs, Khan Maykr, who achieved her rank in hell for committing the ultimate sin of using a vibrator while fantasizing about a crush from geometry class,” he continued. “In fact, the primary motivation for these characters invading Earth is an attempt to slake their depraved lust for self-abuse and sexually-suggestive photographs.”

How did they fuck this up so badly?’ But I just want to make sure my grandma is as comfortable as she can be, and there’s no way I can do that if she’s obsessing about whether Cyberpunk’s chase sequences are even playable on base consoles.”

“God, this thing is a piece of shit,” he added.



What makes this a truly heartwarming story is how hard Jason has worked: Whenever his grandmother asked about how Cyberpunk’s minimap zoom problem was doing, he was there to distract her with a hug or a blanket to keep her warm. Any time he saw her scrolling through a Digital Foundry impression video to check out if there are still T-posed NPCs floating off into the sky above Night City, he was there to bring up her relatives on a Zoom call to wish her all their love or ask how her medication was working that day. Gamers, it’s enough to bring a tear to your eye!

Some late-breaking news ties a bow on this inspiring story. After Jason brought his grandma a doctored-up article confirming that the game is now essentially bug-free—and that a hotfix even removed the nightmarish repeated character model glitch–Dorothy agreed to enter hospice care, where she passed away with a smile on her face last night, secure in her knowledge that CD Projekt Red had produced a worthy sci-fi successor to The Witcher 3. Now that’s the kind of happy ending that’s far too rare outside of video games!",468,2666,19,125

Well, gamers, you can rest easy, because Bethesda has announced that while LaBeouf will be in the upcoming game, his character dies almost as soon as he appears.

That’s right, gaming fans! You can breathe a sigh of relief and let your excitement for the upcoming Bethesda offering bubble over now that developers have confirmed that The Crystal Skull’s well-known sidekick will appear early in the game riding a motorcycle and wearing his characteristic leather jacket, utter a couple of lines of dialogue, and then immediately lose control of his bike and crash headfirst into a tree!

“We wanted to give fans the full Indiana Jones experience, including appearances from all the major characters from the franchise, and we hope players will really enjoy witnessing Mutt appear by Indy’s side for a few moments before he gets launched down a craggy canyon hillside and tumbled into a field of cottonmouth snakes,” developer Todd Howard told OGN, confirming that the cutscene would lead to gameplay that let players stand over LaBeouf’s body as he bled out.



“I don’t want to reveal too much, but I can tell you we’re also planning on having Mutt appear in a few flashbacks where he’s drowning in quicksand and no one is there to save him, and we just know longtime aficionados of the series will love the scene where crows and insects feast on Mutt’s decaying corpse,” he added. “Admittedly, it’s a little bit of fan service, but it’s hard to resist when you have such an iconically loathsome character that people just want to see die.”

Wow. And if that’s not exciting enough, Howard went on to drop a few more hints, announcing that the game would reveal that the monkey who was poisoned by figs in Raiders actually survived and would save Indy’s life dozens of times.",348,2083,19,125

In fact, if we lose this, we lose who we are as an oil-hungry, profit-driven people.” At press time, hundreds of oil executives had joined Trudeau in his protest, shackling themselves to the pipeline with demands to restore the landmark to its former glory.

We have an obligation to do more to make sure that historically underrepresented groups’ blood has a place in our veins because they hold the same key to eternal youth as any white person in their teens and 20s.” At press time, the billionaires claimed this was just the first step, and that within the next 5 to 10 years they plan to start harvesting organs from healthy, young minorities.

And, hey, if you happen to be on the fence because the idea of hunting creatures for loot doesn’t quite sit right with you, we have some great news. One of Rise’s best new features is a dossier listing every monster’s problematic behavior so you don’t have to feel bad when you kill them.

Advertisement

Turns out these beasts have some pretty ugly history, gamers, and they deserve everything that’s coming to them!



What’s great is that this dossier—accessed by hitting the triangle button—erases the twinge of regret we always felt in past Monster Hunter outings as we mowed through Kelbis for horns and pelts. Pair this with a robust new morality system that lets you know immediately that the monster you are stalking is an anti-vaxxer or has made uncomfortable passes at female coworkers, and we’re talking about a game that’s not only a blast to play, but also really cares about easing the burden on your conscience!



Seamlessly integrated into the gameplay, accessing the new Problematic Stats system is as simple as locking onto a monster, popping open the radial menu, and selecting “offenses” to discover that, say, the Barroth in front of you once screamed at an elderly supermarket cashier back in the late aughts and that there’s video evidence to boot! It’s all in service of making sure you should feel free to smash their head in with a hunting horn without any misgivings.

With this huge gameplay improvement, all players can rest easy knowing that these monsters are just suffering the natural consequences of their past bad behavior. When you see that a monster listens to Ben Shapiro’s podcast, the thought “W hy am I hurting this animal?” immediately drops out of your head and instead becomes “H ow can I hurt this animal?” Plus, newbies who may have been turned off by what was once a world of complex, inaccessible lore, ecology, and culture will find everything has been streamlined to make each decision to take a life not only easy, but easily rationalized.



Sorry Wroggi, but that’s what you get for continuing to enjoy the works of Orson Scott Card!

With so much justifiable concern over the moral implications of violent games and their power fantasies, it’s great to see a developer like Capcom take a step like this that makes their franchise more accessible to everyone. In the future, OGN can only hope that more titles—whether Super Mario Galaxy or Horizon Zero Dawn—go the extra mile and include problematic behavior systems so we can continue to hop on Goomba s’ heads and smash down robotic dinosaurs without any regret whatsoever!",462,2727,21,128

Laika? It’s not possible!” shouted the scientists, who fell to their knees with blood running from their eyes as the dog’s voice echoed through their heads and demanded to be taken to the Kremlin. “Please, please, we are sorry. It is all a misunderstanding. It was for science. For the advancement of mankind! We know you are a good girl.

That’s why we were so moved by the heartwarming story of a man who loved his wife so much that he brought his Xbox Series X to the delivery room so she could watch him play Assassin’s Creed Valhalla while in labor.

Oh gosh, did it just get emotional in here or what? We’re not crying, you are!

The hero of this story is Ben Hughes, a 37-year-old lab technician from Ohio who is clearly husband-of-the-year material—t hat’s because when his wife Linda’s water broke, he was prepared to help her through the process in the way only a true gamer could. In addition to including the necessary toiletries and insurance paperwork in their hospital go-bag, he also packed his Xbox Series X, preloaded with a recent save of Assassin’s Creed. That way, Linda could watch him roam Medieval England as a Viking, fighting off enemies and recruiting new clan members as her cervix dilated and her body prepared itself for the stressful experience of giving birth.

As her contractions became more frequent and she began to push, Ben was there supporting her every step of the way, making sure she had a clear view of his devastating axe combos and upgrade path. That level of partner support is a rare thing to come across, but her husband, in his tender devotion, didn’t even think twice about it.

“I knew this would be a stressful situation for her, so I figured it would be nice if she could watch me play while going through all that stuff,’ said Hughes, explaining his relief to discover there was a free outlet near the hospital room’s infusion pump so he can start playing right away. “She always finds it pretty interesting even though she’s not really into video games.”

“What’s amazing is that I actually managed to complete T he Book of Dragons saga while our son’s head started crowning,” he added, growing visibly emotional at the memory. “I never thought I’d get that far with everything else going on.”



Although Linda is sure lucky to have such a sweetheart of a partner, there were some unfortunate complications during her labor. Because of certain uterine abnormalities, the doctors had to perform an emergency C- section, which was a stressful ordeal, to say the least. Luckily, Ben was by her side the whole time, leveling up Eivor while storming the British Isles.



And thankfully, OGN is proud to report that the Hughes family has given birth to a healthy, 8 -pound baby boy named Charlie—and Ben, meanwhile, has successfully reached 100% completion of Valahalla! Mazel tov!",448,2599,23,129

Polish game studio CD Projekt Red just told OGN that they’ve completely eliminated the need for crunch on their upcoming Cyberpunk 2077 by breeding a race of grotesque human-rat hybrids that can work as programmers for weeks on end without the need for sleep or food.

If you had any nagging reservations about picking up this ultra-hyped open-world RPG, you can kiss those worries goodbye!

“We’ve listened to complaints about how hard crunch can be on human programmers, and we want fans to rest assured that we’ve been able to address those head-on with our new coding team of humanoid rodents,” said lead designer Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, noting that immediately after the release of The Witcher 3, a scientific team got to work in the studio’s basement breeding the hairless, 8-foot-tall rat hybrids for intelligence, endurance, and an aptitude for a wide range of programming languages. “What’s incredible is that even as they work at eight times the rate of a typical coder, these transhuman workers don’t even think of accepting benefits or taking a bathroom break.”

“Essentially, these abominations have been built for the sole purpose of making Cyberpunk 2077, and they will die soon after their task is finished,” he added.

Tomaszkiewicz went on to describe his optimism that their hard work would ensure Cyberpunk 2077 will be delivered on time and in good shape, stressing that the rodential abominations had no need to eat or drink while coding due to an intravenous drip fed directly into their wrinkled, highly deformed bodies.

He added that the long-tailed, flesh-toned creatures only had the ability to communicate through what sounded like human screaming, which made them all but incapable of unionizing or sharing concerns with HR.

“What fans should be most excited about is that we’ve removed the part of their rodent brains that would even allow them to think of a life beyond making sure that Night City is the perfect sandbox for RPG fanatics,” he said, adding that any moment the hybrids do not spend crafting a AAA gaming experience is experienced as a sharp, increasingly unpleasant, throbbing pain in the man-rodent’s skull. “And if that’s not enough, we’re on track to sell the game for $10 off its list price thanks to their tireless efforts.”

“Death will be a relief to them,” he added.

1,Whoopsies: The Vatican Has Ruled That Nintendo Committed A Venial Sin After Imbuing Lifeless Paper Products With The Soul Of Mario,https://ogn.theonion.com/whoopsies-the-vatican-has-ruled-that-nintendo-committe-1844519423,"We’ve got some embarrassing news, gamers. After Paper Mario: The Origami King’s positive reception and solid sales, we thought Nintendo was sitting pretty for the summer. But a recent papal brief issued from Vatican City suggests that the iconic video game company might have stepped in it with the Catholic Church. According to Pope Francis’ latest papal bull, Verbum Chartum, Nintendo committed a venial sin when they imbued a lifeless paper product with the soul of Mario.

Whoopsies. Sounds like Nintendo might need to clutch their rosary beads close and say a few extra “Hail Marys” to get back in the Lord’s good graces!

“The messianic message of Christ and His activity among people affirm the truth that the soul cannot transmigrate, and certainly cannot pass into an origami form as Nintendo mistakenly asserts in The Origami King,” wrote Pope Francis in an 2,500-word treatise addressed to the faith’s 1.3 billion faithful, suggesting that those who took part in Paper Mario’s creation or even played the RPG out of curiosity had unquestionably trespassed in the eyes of God. “Let us not forget the great teaching offered by Saint John Paul II in his Dives In Misericordia encyclical, that the Lord created humanity in His image—not as a 2D sheet of paper invested with the soul of a plumber able to crush Goombas with a blow from his Legendary Hammer.”

“Simply put, a lifeless origami doll invested with the soul of Mario, Peach, Bowser, or Luigi is an affront to the word of Our Heavenly Father,” the Bishop of Rome continued. “May God have mercy on [Game Director] Masahiko Nagaya’s soul and the souls of all who enjoy playing this perversion of nature.”

Sorry, gamers! Looks like the very act of playing Paper Mario is going to get you sent to Purgatory! Thankfully, it’s only a venial sin, so you can atone for it by going to confession, performing penance, and even getting extreme unction on your deathbed.

Despite the harsh words from the Holy See, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa stood by the company’s artistic decisions, simply recommending that Paper Mario: Origami King’s creative team and fans regularly attend confessional and remember to say their “Our Fathers” while expressing regret that the Vatican had chosen to excommunicate Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser and gaming icon Shigeru Miyamoto for their unforgivable decision to give life to that to which God did not give a living soul.

Oof. Nintendo really stepped in it this time! We can only hope Nintendo and the Catholic Church patch things up. We haven’t seen things this bad since Pope John Paul’s apostolic letter Novo Millennio Ineunte, which repeatedly condemned Dr. Mario for his history of performing abortions.",453,2752,21,130

It’s been almost a decade since the last release in Bethesda’s beloved fantasy series, but it seems some cool new tidbits about the hotly anticipated sixth installment are just around the bend! Our hounds have been stalking series director Todd Howard through the evening, day in and day out, for nearly a full fortnight, and the tracks from his blood loss suggest he’s slowing down far too quickly to ever outrun us.

These woods are deep and treacherous, gamers. Mr. Howard will not continue long with his broken leg—not without telling us everything he knows about where, exactly, Elder Scrolls VI will take place on the continent of Tamriel. Wily and stout though Todd Howard may be, we all have our breaking points, and that means a new trove of information on the next Elder Scrolls is undoubtedly on the way.

Admittedly, Howard evaded our scouts at the frozen river junction. He deftly navigated through our bear traps in the prairie frost. But judging by the stained bandages we found hastily discarded in the snow, Howard is beginning to succumb to the elements. Soon, his mind will turn on him, and then he will tell us all he knows about the supposed customizable runic magic system and how that will impact the core gameplay experience beloved by Elder Scrolls fans the world over!

Frostbite can be painful, indeed, gaming fans. Eventually, a man may decide the simpler path than fleeing is simply confessing the exact details of what roll the Aldmeri Dominion could play in the new game’s narrative, or if any new joinable factions like the Dawnguard will figure into all of this. Boy, these sure are exciting days to be an open-world fantasy diehard!

To be frank, there were times during our hunt that we feared we would never be able to tell you whether we might see the rebuilt Orsinium, or if dragons might make a reappearance from Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Howard is a worthy prey, indeed. He has often thrown us off his track with false footprints and brush coverings. But this delicious game of cat-and-mouse is coming to an end. Our bloodhounds have picked up his scent for the last time. He is hungry and alone.

It is only a matter of time, gamers.



So check back soon when we’ll be sure to have everything you need to know from the mouth of this legendary game developer! And sound off in comments to let us know if there’s anything you want us to ask the man himself. Just make sure you get in your comments quickly! Based on the latest tracks we found in the snow, it seems like he’s reduced to crawling now and we’re sure to have him in our clutches within the day!

But now we have a piece of truly perplexing news that we’re going to need someone to sort out for us. Today, in separate press conferences, the biggest publishers in the world just revealed that the upcoming installments in the Super Mario, Grand Theft Auto, and Metal Gear Solid franchises are somehow all subtitled “ The Sands of Time” ?



Advertisement

Your guess is as good as ours, gamers. We got nothing on this one.

While we’re incredibly excited to have Nintendo, Rockstar Games, and Hideo Kojima all taking the stage on the same day, we’re also having a tremendous amount of trouble wrapping our heads around why each of the developers’ latest games seems to be named after the 2003 action-platformer set in ancient Persia—or are they? We really have no idea.

It’s especially confusing given that most of the titles in some way makes use of an hourglass in the graphic. You could argue that it was just a mistake if it only happened to be one of these companies that adopted the “Sands of Time” suffix. But all three? It just doesn’t make any sense.

Super Mario: Sands of Time. Grand Theft Auto: The Sands of Time. Metal Gear Solid: The Sands of Time. We’re not going to act like these aren’t cool titles. They definitely are. But we’d assume that Ubisoft would have the exclusive rights to that phrase. Even if not, why would any other game developer want to associate their games with such an iconic phrase? It’s simply not possible that nobody at any of these three major video game companies had ever heard of the original “Sands of Time” game. That was one of the most popular titles of the sixth console generation.

Does anyone understand how this could have happened? Anyone?

We’re just going to go ahead and assume that each game has some sort of time-travel element too, but why would these publishers do that? How could all three of them possibly use this mechanic in an inventive way?

Advertisement

Please don’t take our confusion as negativity, gamers. These are huge announcements for some of the most popular franchises in video game history. We’re talking about a new Metal Gear Solid, a series long thought dead since Kojima’s departure from Konami. And new titles in Mario and Grand Theft Auto? This is incredibly exciting stuff. All we’re saying is that it’s kind of incomprehensible why any single one of them would choose to have a title that had already been used 17 years ago.

We reached out to programmers at Nintendo, Rockstar, and Konami about it, but they refused to respond and seemed genuinely angry that we questioned this baffling decision.

Are they fucking with us?

Seriously, gamers, if anyone knows what the hell is going on here please let us know. Maybe there’s some sort of movement to establish “Sands of Time” as its own video game genre subset that we don’t know about? Or for some reason, all future video ga mes will be named after Prince Of Persia games or Jake Gyllenhaal films?

Unfortunately, today we received an indication that our reporting about the legendary console maker and developer may need to be put on hold. You see, our undercover source at the company disappeared last week, and we’ve just received a box with his severed gaming hand inside. The sad takeaway here is you shouldn’t expect any leaks from us about Nintendo for the foreseeable future.

Our first suspicion that something had gone awry came last week, when our source—long known for his punctuality—missed a scheduled weekly check-in with us. We had been waiting on some big news about the upcoming Nintendo direct, but the time came and went without a peep.



Of course, our intial instinct was to keep calm. He had cancelled drops before, such as when he was in deep cover at Intelligent Systems to blow the lid off the development of Paper Mario: The Origami King. But when he failed to respond on his distress frequency or the coded message on his burner phone, we feared the worst.



Then this morning came. We were delivered a mysterious white box tied with a red ribbon, which contained his hand clutching a Wii U controller with no note or message attached. You don’t need to be a genius to read between the lines and know there won’t be any Breath Of The Wild 2 news from us anytime soon.

Obviously, this is a huge blow to us because our mole has been one of the best sources of Nintendo information for the past decade. Most notably, he escaped a team of President Satoru Iwata’s deadly fixers to deliver us an untested beta of Pikmin 3. If you ever wondered how we managed to confirm the existence of rock Pikmin way back in 2008, now you know: It is a testament to his dedication and cunning that this vital information ever leaked to the public at all. Now, looking at this severed hand, we understand that the release of Mario Golf: Super Rush could come and go without us being able to report on potential DLC characters.



Needless to say, it’s a hard pill to swallow.

Clearly, our informant’s fate is sealed. Anyone familiar with Nintendo’s tactics know they are notoriously cruel towards leakers, with untold legions being poisoned, drowned, or bludgeoned to death by during the past reign of the lunatic Reggie Fils-Aimé. Thankfully, our informant did have a cyanide capsule embedded in his molar, so the best we can hope for is that he died peacefully by his own hand.

Still, we will not let this man’s brave sacrifice be in vain. It is our sacred duty to inform you of upcoming Yoshi and Star Fox games, and this setback will not deter us. This individual was only one of our assets within Nintendo. We can strike at them in any department, at any time. If it is a war Nintendo wants, then it is a war Nintendo will get.",509,2874,25,133

Our early hands-on with the Warehouse demo confirms that everything we loved about the original titles are back in full force. (Just try not to melt into a puddle of gooey nostalgia when Goldfinger’s “Superman” soundtracks your first noseslide). Interestingly, though, developers Vicarious Visions revealed to OGN that the game features one major change: Every character in the game will know that the Iraq War happened.

“Obviously, we wanted to do justice replicating all the amazing details that make the original so beloved, but we also knew we wanted to mix things up by making sure in-game characters like Bob Burnquist, Kareem Campbell, and Tony Hawk are all aware of the United State’s decision to invade Iraq in 2003,” said senior developer Christian Santos, describing the agonizing hours spent to make sure each character model reflects the grim realities of an eight-year invasion with unclear goals that left half a million Iraqis dead. “Officer Dick is back as an unlockable, too. We spent so much time getting the slump in his stance just right to show how—even though he’s ollying and grinding his way through kickass levels such as Roswell—his faith in national institutions has been completely shattered from the sustained campaign of lies about Saddam Hussein’s possession of weapons of mass destruction.”



“You can see it in these characters’ eyes: These are skateboarders living in a world where America’s role on the world stage has become deeply ambiguous,” he continued.

Going on to explain that his team had paid painstaking of recreating fan-favorite levels like New York City, Santos stressed that the remake took liberties only when strictly necessary such as when skaters grind toward the September 11th Memorial and spontaneously shout lines like, “How the hell did this invasion even factor into the War on Terror?” and, “4,424 American soldiers dead—d o Rumsfeld or Rice even care?” and, “S kateboarding just doesn’t feel the same in a post-Iraq War age.”

Welp, color us impressed. We already couldn’t wait to manual our way around some of our favorite skateboarding levels of all time. But it sounds like Vicarious Visions has given this remake just the dash of spice to make us even more intrigued. Rock on, gamers!

Our early hands-on with the Warehouse demo confirms that everything we loved about the original titles are back in full force. (Just try not to melt into a puddle of gooey nostalgia when Goldfinger’s “Superman” soundtracks your first noseslide). Interestingly, though, developers Vicarious Visions revealed to OGN that the game features one major change: Every character in the game will know that the Iraq War happened.

“Obviously, we wanted to do justice replicating all the amazing details that make the original so beloved, but we also knew we wanted to mix things up by making sure in-game characters like Bob Burnquist, Kareem Campbell, and Tony Hawk are all aware of the United State’s decision to invade Iraq in 2003,” said senior developer Christian Santos, describing the agonizing hours spent to make sure each character model reflects the grim realities of an eight-year invasion with unclear goals that left half a million Iraqis dead. “Officer Dick is back as an unlockable, too. We spent so much time getting the slump in his stance just right to show how—even though he’s ollying and grinding his way through kickass levels such as Roswell—his faith in national institutions has been completely shattered from the sustained campaign of lies about Saddam Hussein’s possession of weapons of mass destruction.”



“You can see it in these characters’ eyes: These are skateboarders living in a world where America’s role on the world stage has become deeply ambiguous,” he continued.

Going on to explain that his team had paid painstaking of recreating fan-favorite levels like New York City, Santos stressed that the remake took liberties only when strictly necessary such as when skaters grind toward the September 11th Memorial and spontaneously shout lines like, “How the hell did this invasion even factor into the War on Terror?” and, “4,424 American soldiers dead—d o Rumsfeld or Rice even care?” and, “S kateboarding just doesn’t feel the same in a post-Iraq War age.”

Welp, color us impressed. We already couldn’t wait to manual our way around some of our favorite skateboarding levels of all time. But it sounds like Vicarious Visions has given this remake just the dash of spice to make us even more intrigued. Rock on, gamers!

If you haven’t yet had a chance to check out PlayStation’s revolutionary new gaming system, fear not—the PS5 in an ancient cave painting uncovered in Cáceres‎ , Spain that foretells the end of the earth looks like it contains some kind of unreleased PS5 slim edition.

That’s right—i f you’ve been itching to try out the most powerful next-gen console to date before the end times, don’t worry! We at OGN can confirm that the illustration of the PS5—discovered on subterranean cave walls featuring primitive symbols referring to an “Epoch Of Destruction”—appears significantly smaller and more streamlined than the current PS5, as well as featuring a dark brown color scheme that is not currently available.

This is also a huge win for those lucky enough to have already gotten their hands on a PS5, given that you’ll be able to enjoy hours of lightning-fast loading and unparalleled haptic feedback unimpeded by the darkening sky, boiling ocean, or rivers of blood prophesied in the oldest extant work of art by humankind. And if you’re still searching high and low for your PS5, it looks like PlayStation will have months or even years to restock the shelves before unveiling this special edition that presages swarms of locusts and the dead returning to life.

That’s it for now, gamers, but check this space for any and all updates for what is sure to be an even more immersive and technically impressive update to the PS5 gaming system despite ushering in the ancient heathen Gods that will unleash a thousand years of torment!",264,1573,24,134

It was a truly impressive TV moment, and it may represent a whole new chapter for the dining brand.” Cillizza added that a fact check would be forthcoming, but there was no doubt that the message of delicious and convenient food had stuck a chord with wide swaths of Americans.

Gamers, this is bad. This is really bad. We don’t know how this happened exactly, but we were just playing a game of Super Mario Party a few minutes ago when Mario and Yoshi used a warp box at the same time and... dear God—emerged onto the board as a horrifying, fused monstrosity.



Advertisement

Holy shit, this is really bad. We don’t want to look. But we cannot stop ourselves.

Gamers, we are nauseated just looking at the grotesque mass of green flesh pulsing over Mario’s iconic red hat. But what’s worse is we can’t even say for certain what occurred during that warp to cause this moral trespass. All that’s clear is both Yoshi and Mario were holding warp boxes at the time, and when Mario used his to swap places, it seems like Yoshi accidentally activated his own, splicing their genetic code together into... into this... Jesus, we’re going to be sick.



One thing that’s obvious is that dinosaur and human DNA are not a good match, and this ungodly creature seems to be in deep pain. It’s pulsating with tumors or cysts or something, and fluid is leaking out all over from the burst pustules. Oh Christ, Yoshi’s red tongue is twitching around horribly on the outside of its body.

What inhuman horror have these two wrought?



As terrible as this misbegotten creature is, what’s scaring us even more is the fear and revulsion reflected in the eyes of the other game characters in King Bob-omb’s Powderkeg Mine. Peach just fell to the ground racked with sobs and is trying to tear her own eyes out. Meanwhile, Donkey Kong apparently went mad, because he immediately started screaming in madness and then leaped off the map into the lava below rather than look one more moment upon this repulsive hybrid.



Oh, no, no, no, there’s a sound coming from the unspeakable thing’s throat now—a wet hiss, a weeping scream emanating out of its dual-tongued mouth. It wants us to come closer, but we can’t. We won’t let this thing come close. No way.



Oh, fuck, what’s it doing? Fuck, FUCK, it’s dragging itself towards the railroad tracks—it looks like it’s trying to run itself over with a mine cart, but its poor, decrepit body doesn’t have the strength to make it that far. Sweet mother of Christ, we don’t know what we did to deserve seeing this, but now the monstrosity is looking right at us through the screen and begging us to come over there to end its torture.

After last week’s $499 price reveal of the upcoming Xbox Series X, Playstation struck back, printing billions in counterfeit bills and flooding the market to cause hyperinflation, making the American d ollar completely worthless.

Hope you Xbox stans enjoy spending $400,000 on a can of Coke!

Gamers have been waiting with baited breath for Sony’s response to the Series X price, remembering gleefully that the company drew blood last generation by pricing the Playstation 4 at $100 less than the Xbox One. Thankfully, the machiavellian masterminds at Sony did not disappoint, with their gambit sending U.S. markets into a historic panic that has led to Americans carrying around wheelbarrows full of cash, begging retailers to take anything for food, and hoarding clean water and firearms. Sorry Microsoft, but you can’t make money if money doesn’t even mean anything anymore!

Xbox took a calculated risk by continuing to price their console at a premium, hoping the higher margins would cover the cost of new technology, but Sony did not miss a beat in flooding the American money market with cheap cash and phony currency, completely breaking down the very system Microsoft hoped to rely on. We’re guessing that far fewer gamers are going to be willing to barter for a Series X using sacks of potatoes and goats—the few products with tangible value now that the country’s markets have imploaded due to hyperinflation. If you’re a Sony fan, you gotta love the thought of getting one over on Microsoft like this, no matter how cold, hungry, and terrified you might be about the impending collapse of human society.



Still, you can never count out a console- maker like Microsoft until it’s over, especially in an epic rivalry like this. In fact, we’re already hearing reports that Microsoft execs have gathered a pile a sharpened sticks and started throwing stones at the windows of the Sony of America headquarters in order to tempt them into a hand -to-hand brawl to end their efforts at currency manipulation. All we can say for sure is the future looks bright, because when two tech giants like this clash, gamers win!",368,2206,20,139

NEW YORK—Shaking their heads in amazement at their failure to see what had been staring them in the face during the entire pandemic, the nation expressed disbelief Friday that they had spent so long overlooking the obvious solution of encapsulating the mRNA instructions for a coronavirus-based spike protein in a lipid nanoparticle. “It’s so obvious in retrospect: You create a mutated form of the spike protein for SARS-CoV-2, swap in a couple proline substitutions to trigger an immune system reaction, wrap that up in a few- nanometer- thick lipid delivery mechanism, and suddenly—wham—you’ve got an effective coronavirus vaccine,” said local bartender Sophie Litzman, one of 323 million citizens who slapped themselves in the forehead a t their own total idiocy for not immediately shouting out “use a solid lipid core matrix to deliver a messenger RNA-based payload that teaches cells to churn out modified proteins to prepare the immune system for viral contact!” the moment they saw news of the novel coronavirus’s spread. “Obviously, hindsight is 20/20, but I was really just keeping quiet because I thought ‘stimulating immunogenicity through intramuscular injections of a strong RBD-binding IgG with robust CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses’ was on the tip of everyone else’s tongue.

1,Disaster: Next-Gen Loading Screens Are Going Too Fast For Gamers To Read Tips And Tricks And Now Everyone Is Forgetting How To Play Video Games,https://ogn.theonion.com/disaster-next-gen-loading-screens-are-going-too-fast-f-1845864089,"When we first got our hands on the next generation of consoles, one of the most thrilling prospects was the near-instant load times. Gone would be the persistent frustration of dying in a boss fight or while entering a new zone and having to wait three minutes to jump back into the fray. Little did we know, this power comes with a dark lining. Reports out today suggest that Xbox Series X and PS5 loading screens are going too fast for gamers to read the tips and tricks displayed in the corner of the screen, and everyone has now forgotten how to play video games.

Pandora’s box has been unleashed with these lightning fast loading times, and as a result, outright chaos has been loosed about the video game world.

“I was trying to play Demon’s Souls, and before I even got a chance to read a tip on how to dodge roll, I was thrown into this area called The Nexus and had absolutely no idea how to move or interact with anything,” said Kyle Stanfield, 32, one of millions of gamers worldwide who set their controller down in confusion after having mere moments to grasp the game’s combat and healing suggestions. “I thought there’d been a mistake, so I reloaded it hoping to have a few minutes to learn about the lore of the Regeneration Ring or how to spend my Souls to upgrade a weapon. But then I was just right back into the game again and had no idea what to do.”

“That’s when I started screaming,” said Stanfield.



Everywhere across the globe, gamers are reportedly reacting with confusion, anger, and outright horror to their lack of access to loading screens giving them tips on class customization or how to invert shooting controls in the option screen. Sources have confirmed that many have forgotten how their joystick worked, while others reacted by simply setting their controller down, standing up, and walking directly into their television. Some have even forgotten the entire concept of video games, tearfully begging friends and family members to explain how they—a being of flesh and blood—could possibly interact with a digital character on a television screen.



What we now know is that having a few minutes to read an introduction to a new enemy type or enchanted blade is utterly essential to knowing how to play a video game without going insane. But for the huge swath of gamers who have smashed their DualSense out of fear after it started shaking because they missed the explanation that “controller rumbles will tip you off to in-game secrets,” it may already be too late.



In the rush to make our gaming experiences more seamless, we accidentally removed one of the pillars holding up gaming. The edifice is crumbling, readers, and we do not know how to shore it up. That’s why we’re begging next-gen developers everywhere: Please, throttle your loading times. The future of video games may depend upon it.

""We must do all we can to support free elections in America and allow democracy to gain a foothold there,"" Kostunica said. ""The U.S. is a major player in the Western Hemisphere and its continued stability is vital to Serbian interests in that region.""

Kostunica urged Al Gore, the U.S. opposition-party leader who is refusing to recognize the nation's Nov. 7 election results, to ""let the democratic process take its course.""

""Mr. Gore needs to acknowledge the will of the people and concede that he has lost this election,"" Kostunica said. ""Until America's political figures learn to respect the institutions that have been put in place, the nation will never be a true democracy.""

Serbian forces have been stationed throughout the U.S., with an emphasis on certain trouble zones. Among them are Oregon, Florida, and eastern Tennessee, where Gore set up headquarters in Bush territory. An additional 10,000 troops are expected to arrive in the capital city of Washington, D.C. by Friday.

Though Kostunica has pledged to work with U.S. leaders, he did not rule out the possibility of economic sanctions if the crisis is not resolved soon.

""For democracy to take root and flourish, it must be planted in the rich soil of liberty. And the cornerstone of liberty is elections free of tampering or corruption,"" Kostunica said. ""Should America prove itself incapable of learning this lesson on its own, the international community may be forced to take stronger measures.""",277,1753,21,143

Join us, you downcast and beaten followers of OGN, on a journey to an eldritch land of unspeakable gaming fortune.

Though our misbegotten realm’s console supply has grown fallow in these merciless days, there was a lice-ridden dotard—near insane with syphilis and drink—who whispered of an eldritch citadel far beyond the idle wastelands where each brick composed of PS5 standard and digital editions. There, mute and dumb faces peek from windows wearing strings of DualSense controllers around their necks as if they were mere trinkets. One can simply dip a wicker basket in the river and emerge with hundreds of copies of Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales. Or so the lunatic fool told us, at least. At first, we cast off these tales as the ravings of starved and deranged minds, but we could not help but dream. What if it is real, gamers? What if?

Over the mountains that burn in the land of eternal sun, and through the deepest canyons where man-eating chimeras prowl every turn, that is where we will find spires ascending to the sky built of nothing but AMD graphics cards, solid-state hard drives, and 8-core processors. The house of every peasant bedecked with painted consoles, filled with overflowing chests of every next-gen game. A friend of the drunkard—an outdoorsman and scout by training—who came to us with a tattered PS5 power cord claims to have seen this Xanadu. He says that PS5s are so common that they are used as ballast on rough-hewn fishing junks, and the shoeless children of the poor entertain this bizarre realm’s royalty by kicking them around like balls. He also claims his expedition faltered when his partners went mad with greed and drowned trying to carry hundreds of the Sony consoles across the raging river that marks the boundary of this ancient land. He says the locals reclaimed their bodies.



This scout is the gentleman who shall lead us to the boundary of this land, gamers, although he swears he will go no farther. And you—if you also seek the bounty of immersive graphics and haptic feedback that lies hidden just beyond our reach—he will lead you, too.



We have 200 camels and horses, gamers, laden with waterskins, salted mutton, and fully charged Nintendo Switches. We have firearms and native guides who have promised to show us the way. It will not be easy. Many of us will likely perish, if not of hunger or heat stroke than of some unknown exotic disease, or in the teeth of a fierce beast for which words and drawings cannot prepare us. But we will not be deterred by the failures of past parties. Gaming glory awaits us. We will return with more PS5s than the world has ever seen and go down emblazoned in the annals of all recorded time. Will you join our company to seek this strange and unknown land? Will you make history with us, gamers?",549,3186,26,146

Here’s the first image of the latest console from Sony in all its glory! We thought this photo showing off the console’s sleek and bold design with white flourishes was pretty cool while we were first sourcing it, but by the time we put it on our website, we almost had a full-on panic attack just thinking about all the abuse we were inviting from you guys over any potential praise of the design, or even just our word choice in describing it. It really stressed us out, gamers. Sometimes when we were trying to fall asleep, we would think about how mean you would be about this article and we would have trouble breathing.

It would be nice if gaming fans could just have a nice, level-headed conversation about the console specs, but even something as simple as that is still probably not enough for some of you jerks who are going to just tear us apart for no apparent reason. In case it’s not clear, we didn’t take any of these pictures and we definitely didn’t design the PS5, so your constant verbal assaults against us are not only hurtful but they’re also not remotely productive.



Here’s another photo that offers some tantalizing glimpses of the PS5, and yes, before you say anything, this photo came out a couple of days ago. So if you’ve been following the latest PlayStation news obsessively, then this isn’t going to be as exciting for you, but please try to keep in mind that there are other readers out there who might be enjoying this photo and try not to crap all over their good time. You know, we used to come into work every day with a spring in our step, but we haven’t felt that way in months, thanks to you.

Yeah, this is the first photo again. That’s all we have, okay? Why are you so cruel about this? We can’t just conjure up more photos out of thin air.



Jesus, this was supposed to be our dream job. PlayStation just surprised fans by announcing that there would be two versions of the PS5, and we get to report on that, which should be fun and energizing. Instead, even as we’re writing this, we can hear your voices in our heads whining about the lack of a disc drive in the budget option or some bullshit detail about the controllers we missed in this article. This has become a miserable slog thanks to you ungrateful assholes. And you know what? Maybe you’re right! Maybe Sony screwed up. We’re certainly not perfect, we’re just trying to do our best. But maybe take that to heart and check your fucking attitude for a second, because we don’t see you dipshits publishing any console reviews. So consider just putting a goddamn sock in it.

Are you still angry about us repeating a photo? God. We’d say sorry about it, but we know there’s no amount of apologizing we can do at this point without you tearing us a new asshole, is there? When you treat us like absolute shit no matter what we do, there’s really no incentive for us to do a good job. Just some food for thought.

While past trailers for The Last of Us Part II made it look like it would be a genre-defining interactive experience that expanded on everything that made the original great, Naughty Dog revealed today that they spent so much time crafting the game’s incredible plot and cinematics that the actual gameplay will just consist of a simple word puzzle mini-game.

We’ll admit it: This is a legitimate letdown.



“Unfortunately, we spent the past five years so intent on topping the original Last Of Us’s storytelling that we spent our entire budget on motion capture and just forgot to include any interactivity until about three days ago,” said director Neil Druckmann, who told OGN he had spent the past 72 stress-inducing hours rushing to code a word puzzle game as a stand-in for any gaming element. “It’s kind of a blend of crossword puzzles and sudoku. There’s a point system and our graphics guy threw together a nice icon to show Joel’s face, but that’s about all we had time for.”



“Look, we’re really sorry about this,” he continued.



In our short hands-on with the game, we got to see a gut-wrenching confessional scene where Ellie opens up to a potential romantic interest about the devastating experience of surviving in a ruined world, before abruptly taking a dog-eared collection of word games from her back pocket and saying, “Hey, these are fun. Let’s play.” From there, we were launched into the gameplay, where Ellie’s static avatar glided onscreen and we were prompted to fill out a grid with a short hint about words like “smallest state in the union” or “fungus that destroed world [sic].”



Frankly, we wish we had better news, readers, but this was not the polished release we were looking for.



“Between the 15 puzzles and some special themes like ‘Underwater Exploration’ or ‘Classic Tinseltown Stars,’ we have some decent variety in there,” explained Druckmann, before admitting that the experience would still likely underwhelm anyone expecting an edge-of-your-seat adventure that featured Ellie fighting her way through a post-apocalyptic America. “The game’s dictionary is pretty limited, unfortunately, because we just didn’t budget any time or manpower to honing this experience. So, a lot of answers won’t register as real words even though they are.”

“Now, we managed to throw a lot of references to word searches into the cutscenes, which certainly helps explain why the characters keep playing this weird little crossword game, but I understand if anyone is disappointed,” he said.



So yeah, gamers. This might not be the awesome survival-horror game we were eagerly awaiting all these years, but after watching so many amazing cutscenes, we’re still holding out hope The Last of Us Part II will top plenty of Game Of The Year lists, including ours!

We’ve witnessed some amazing panels, dream-come-true announcements, and a few moments that surprised even us. Still, there’s one small detail that’s been irking us. Gamers, are you not seeing all the olives we left around the expo hall for you? There are, like, $ 500 worth here, and it’d be a huge waste if no one scooped them up and tried a few.



Advertisement

We left all of these olives out for you, guys! So really, feel free to have at ’ em!

Look, readers, we thought this would be a nice treat for everyone, so it’s just a bit of a bummer that we scattered these olives around the convention center and nobody is even picking them up to try a little nibble. Now, it’s possible no one has noticed them, but we really tried to make sure that wasn’t the case. There are olive on tables, some are on the floor, some are in baskets. Anywhere you look, there are olives.

These aren’t some cheap prepackaged olives from the grocery store, either. Maybe that’s what you’re worried about? We went to a nice cheese store and picked them up before the show. We’re talking green and black. Even a few stuffed with blue cheese. Please understand, that’s hundreds of dollars from our pockets down the drain if you don’t even take a little nibble.

Come on, gamers, why are you stepping over them like they’re trash? These are really great olives. Some of them are K alamatas straight from Greece, some have rosemary in the brine. There are even these spicy buffalo- flavored ones that are really nice, too. Even if you don’t want a ton of olives, you can be nice about it and just grab a couple.

Hell, if you really don’t like olives, all you have to do is put them on your plate, walk around with them for a little bit, and then throw them out while we aren’t looking.

Honestly, we’re a little annoyed with you right now, gamers. We sent out an email to see if anybody had dietary restrictions and no one even responded, so we were left to assume everyone was cool with olives. And now we’ve basically spent 500 dollars on nothing.

Think about it: How would that make you feel?

Now, we will take some ownership that we should have left them in jars instead of just putting them down on the conference floor and booths. But we had this image in our head that it would set up a nice tableau, and then we just ran with it. Who knows? Maybe we got overly excited about putting olives everywhere. Either way, their brine is probably an antibacterial, so it’s not like it’s going to get you sick by just picking them up and popping one in your mouth.

Listen, we’re not perfect. Not by a long shot. We’ll admit that a pitted snack might not be the best thing for a video game conference without many trash cans. But you could have at least told us you didn’t enjoy olives before the conference started. We just wanted to do something nice for you and now you’re making us feel like jerks.

This wasn’t out of some food discretionary fund, either. All of our writers pooled their own money in a little manila envelope labeled “OLIVES” because we thought it would be a great reward for our attendees. Instead, we’re going to have to pack them up in Tupperware containers at the end of the day and take them home.

1,Tough: The New TMNT Game Follows A European Trip Where The Turtles Realize Their Fervent Italian-American Pride Has Little In Common With Modern Italian Life,https://ogn.theonion.com/tough-the-new-tmnt-game-follows-a-european-trip-where-1846600138,"When publisher Dotemu announced they were coming out with an all-new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game, everyone on our staff was over the moon imagining our favorite mutant fighters once again hitting the mean streets of New York to brawl it out with archenemies like Krang or Beebop and maybe even scrounge up a slice or two. Unfortunately, our excitement has been tempered by the developer’s recent announcement that the new side-scroller centers around a European trip where the turtles realize their fervent Italian-American pride has little in common with modern Italian life.

Oof, sorry, gamers. While Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge is a welcome return to form for the heroes on the half shell, it’s hard not to feel bummed out as the four turtles realize their strong personal and cultural connection to Italy is almost a complete fantasy predicated on their affinity for The Sopranos and marinara sauce.



“The Turtles run into a snag early on when Michelangelo tries to order a chicken parmesan sandwich at a trattoria near their hotel only to be informed that that’s not an authentic Italian dish,” said Philip Stephens, lead developer at Dotemu, noting that the consternation of the turtles is compounded by their near-complete lack of Italian language abilities outside of rudimentary phrases. “From there, it only gets worse as they must reckon with seatless toilets and a lack of air conditioning at most establishments that aren’t in line with their romanticized version of Italy.”

In our playthrough, things picked up slightly after Donatello gets pickpocketed during an architecture tour and the Turtles hunt down the thief in the unfamiliar Parioli neighborhood. There, they attempt to bond with locals over a shared love of pizza, the films of Francis Ford Coppola, and Michelangelo’s bicep tattoo of the Italian flag, only to be met with skepticism and even derision by those who consider the quartet to be little more than American tourists.

Despite the game’s intuitive design and old-school sprite graphics—likely to excite any longtime Turtles fan—the game is dragged down by the melancholy of innocence lost, culminating with Raphael getting drunk on Bellinis and screaming at Leonardo for refusing to let April O’Neil come along since her Irish heritage would preclude her from “really understanding” what it means to be Italian.

Fans might also be surprised that most of the game’s finale takes place at a McDonald’s near the Colosseum, where the exhausted turtles send texts and photos to Splinter to convince him that they are having the time of their lives. What’s even more surprised that Shredder’s titular “revenge” appears to be not a nefarious doomsday plot, but merely the dawning comprehension that almost nothing in life will ever satisfy our inflated expectations.



Nonetheless, despite uneven gameplay and a rocky narrative, Shredder’s Revenge has one of the most satisfying conclusions we’ve seen in years, as the turtles begin boarding their flight to LaGuardia full of stories from their time aboard, and they realize there’s no right or wrong way to be Italian.

In what will come as a major disappointment for fans of the popular high-fantasy RPG, the prolific game developer had just stepped on stage and uttered the words, “I’m thrilled to announce, ” when a truly massive rat—we’re talking, like, the size of a dalmatian, we swear to God—just leaped up from out of nowhere and dragged the screaming Bethesda executive producer into the murky depths. There was some thrashing around for a while, but it ended very, very quickly.

Sadly, it looks like we’re just going to have to continue to wait to hear about the forthcoming adventures on the continent Tamriel since after the brief sounds of a struggle, everything is completely silent. There aren’t even any bubbles escaping from the surface anymore. It’s just the trickling of the water and whisper of the wind outside.

We didn’t even know rats could get that big. Jesus Christ.

While it’s undoubtedly a bummer that we didn’t glean so much as a release date or confirmation about the subtitle of the hotly anticipated sixth title in the Elder Scrolls series, this sudden and violent incident at the Expo serves as a good reminder that life is a fragile and truly precious thing. Stay tuned, gamers, we’ll keep reporting all the latest news from OGE, but right now we’re so shaken up that we’re just going to stand here for a little while longer listening to the wind and the croak of frogs until the fog lifts.",310,1758,29,161

As such, our editorial board was saddened but unsurprised to see virtually all of the industry’s trade organizations fold under the pressure of a mere globe-spanning pandemic: E3, GDC, the Tokyo Game Show, and more gave in to the spineless alarmists who put public health over the importance of game expos. Ultimately, our hand was forced.

That’s why today, we are proud to announce The Onion Gamers Expo, a weeklong video game conference spanning October 5 to 9, unafraid to kick-start the resurgence in our global pandemic.

Staged in the lavishly appointed 750 million-square-foot Zweibel Convention Center in downtown Phnom Penh, Cambodia, the Onion Gamers Expo is a conference that refuses to let gamers go for a year without the vital resources of mind-blowing trailers and stunning gaming announcements. It answers lesser conference’s timid kowtowing to so-called “pandemic experts” with a full-throated clarion call: Video games are here, video games are important, and video games cannot be held back by the threat of a few hundred thousand measly moralities to a virulent respiratory virus.

With commitments from Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, Atari, and Coleco Industries, OGE is dedicated to the principle that humanity requires—nay, demands—video game conventions. Indeed, they are vital to our civilization’s very survival. Would the great empires of Rome and Greece have canceled their video game conference if threatened with a simple flu? No! Would the free citizens of the gaming world have stood for a year lacking such gatherings without making the streets run red with the blood of their feckless political leaders? Unquestionably.

You see, then, that we had no choice but to ignore pleading from three dozen medical experts and invest heavily in creating a video conference like none before it or after.

This conference—and its 10,000 vendors, 2,750 major publishers, 713 gaming icon-packed panels, and dozens of dedicated communal soup troughs—is dedicated to those who despaired going for all of 2020 without receiving a single piece of Ratchet & Clank swag. It exists to comfort the troubled minds of those who worried that they would never again see a flustered Ubisoft tech crew spend their entire stage time trying to get a hands-on demonstration of Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla working again after a game-ending glitch. It exists for the legions of gamers who would have rioted and pillaged all the great cities of the earth without artist stalls where they could clandestinely purchase a book of Spryo the Dragon erotica. In other words, it exists for you, reader.

Indeed, even as you read these words, millions are salivating to see the pandemic generation of gaming conferences up close and personal in a way those gutless buffoons at E3 were unwilling to give you. It’s an understandable reaction for any self-respecting gamers, and even more so for those perceptive few able to see past the absurdity that breathing is more important than video games. So, keep your eyes on our social media account to get your tickets, and visit the Onion Gamer Expo store for your official OGE merch. But hurry! We only have 1.5 million tickets left, and they’re sure to run out soon!

Two days after our staff expected him, a severely overweight, dead-eyed Shigeru Miyamoto just showed up to the Onion Gamer Expo with his eyebrows shaved off, and he is now silently wandering around the convention hall.

Oof. We really don’t know what to make of this.

See, Mr. Miyamoto, the legendary game designer for Nintendo, was originally scheduled to give a presentation on the main stage earlier this week. As abiding fans of everything he’s contributed to the history of video games, we were all really excited by a rumor that he might be making a big announcement about an upcoming Mario game. He didn’t show up, though, and we didn’t hear anything from him or his representatives about where he was. Ultimately, we assumed he had canceled due to an illness.

Flash forward to today, spectators at the Cyberpunk 2077 demonstration noticed an unhealthily obese, middle-aged Japanese man standing completely still in the middle of the Marvel’s Avengers tent, emptily staring at an exit sign. We didn’t recognize him at first, but after taking a second look, we realized, dear God, that’s Shigeru Miyamoto, and he looks like he’s in horrible shape.

What the hell is going on, gamers?

Our first concern wasn’t that he had missed delivering Monday’s exclusive OGE Nintendo Direct. The more pressing thing was that Miyamoto appeared to be eating from a three-pound sack full of pistachios while repeatedly muttering the word “liars” under his breath in a near-catatonic state. His shirt is completely stained and rumpled, and, well, let’s just say he doesn’t smell great. It’s like a combination of rubbing alcohol and really badly burnt clay—it makes you gag a little just getting a whiff from far away.

After overcoming our distress, we tried to approach the designer behind The Legend Of Zelda and Super Mario and ask what he thought of the conference, and he just said, “Maybe I will—maybe I fucking will—see how they feel about it” before wandering off to the Epic Games booth, where he’s now just glaring at Tim Sweeney and breathing loudly. We’re really scared, and we’re not sure why.

Readers, should we call an ambulance or something?

Either way, we’ll keep an eye on him for you, and let you know if there are any updates. Suffice it to say, it doesn’t look like we’re getting bonus DLC for Super Mario Odyssey or a new 3DS version of Mario Party anytime soon, and what this means for the future of Nintendo in the next generation is anyone’s guess.",432,2532,27,167

Jesus Christ, you don’t even know why, do you?



We just spent four fucking days—four days—trapped inside a rolled-over minivan, and we are deeply frustrated that none of you reported us missing when we didn’t even cover the news about the next-generation Ratchet & Clank.



Sure, it was scary being stuck inside our totaled Honda Odyssey with our wife and daughters after we swerved into a ditch to avoid colliding with an eighteen-wheeler on the highway. Based on the severe injuries we sustained, we actually thought this might be the end of the road. But the whole time, we took solace in our conviction that one of you would alert the authorities when we didn’t post about our excitement for Insomniac Games announcing Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, an upcoming installment in the beloved third-person shooter series for the PlayStation 5.



You didn’t even notice it, though. Come the fuck on, gamers.



Frankly, after having spent decades of our lives delivering you up-to-date commentary on the latest developments in the world of video games, we assumed we had developed a certain type of relationship with our readership. At the very least, we assumed you would realize something was wrong when we didn’t say anything about Ratchet’s ability to hop between dimensions or the new freeze ray effect that takes full advantage of the PS5’s powerful system architecture. It looks like we were wrong, though.



The whole time we were trapped under the badly dented roof, trying to wriggle our paralyzed legs out of the totaled wreckage, we kept telling our wife, Susan, “Don’t worry, the OGN readers will see that we haven’t reported on Rift Apart’s use of real-time ray tracing and come looking for us.” But no, there was nothing. No missing persons report. No attempts to reach out to us. No asking our friends if they’ve seen us. For the entire 96 hours, you didn’t do anything.



And don’t give us any of that bullshit about how you thought we maybe just decided not to issue a comment on it. You know damn well the mysterious new female Lombax character is something we’d post about immediately. We would probably have included all the best fan tributes to the character in a slideshow.

That’s the last time we ever expect anything from you, readers. Next time something goes wrong, we know not to count on even the bare minimum of help. Message fucking received. And, by the way, there’s no way in hell we’re going to write about the new Ratchet & Clank now. You can go find that news somewhere else. You people are monsters.",545,3112,29,172

We don’t know if you heard, but apparently, we aren’t allowed to have even one nice thing without it being destroyed by that backstabbing bitch Deborah Hart. In fact, we here at OGN might as well cancel our entire Onion Gaming Expo because even though we already sent out invites to our conference and people are showing up, Deborah scheduled her video game expo for the exact same time as ours and her rich parents are hiring Bobby Flay to cook hors d’oeuvres.

We seriously just want to kill ourselves right now, readers!

What makes this even worse is that we know for a fact that Deborah never even wanted to hold a video game conference before she heard about ours. We were nice enough to suggest that she come to OGE like a week after we had the idea, and she just said, “Oh yeah, maybe.” But now she’s invited all the same people that were on our guest list and got American celebrity chef Bobby Flay himself to put together little finger sandwiches and lamb kebab lollipops, while we’re still stuck trying to get Mangiano’s House of Pizza to donat e some free bread sticks and soda.

We can’t help but think this is all a lot of horseshit, gamers. After the months of hard work we put into OGE, Deborah just up and throws her own bash o n the first weekend of August? There’s no way that’s a coincidence. Plus, we can’t do anything to upstage her because her parents are executives at Wells Fargo or something and can afford to hire culinary master Bobby Flay and rent out a karaoke machine to play 8 -bit versions of pop songs for the whole night. Meanwhile, we all had to get part-time jobs to pay for the streamers that we picked up at Party City. Also, Deborah gets an allowance of $300 a week just for sweeping the kitchen, but she makes their housekeeper do it most of the time anyway, and she’s not even spending any of that money on her video game expo!

Look, let’s be real: Deborah isn’t even an actual gamer— she’s just doing this because she likes that guy Brock on the varsity basketball team and she knows he’s into video games. Sure, Deborah’s family has a Nintendo Switch and she plays Animal Crossing: New Horizons sometimes, but that’s not enough to explain a sudden interest in having thousands of people flock to a rented-out convention center for a whole five-day gaming extravaganza featuring a chef extraordinaire with his own show on the Food Network.

It’s just like the time she debuted her own Portal 2 demo impressions right before we did so people would vote for her for homecoming queen.

Then again, we all know why more people might show up to Deb orah’s thing. She’s easy. Like, really easy. Yeah, we said it. And we’re sure that Bobby Flay would much rather come to our conference if he knew all the rumors about Deborah giving out handjobs in the Golden Corral parking lot in exchange for free beer. She’s also totally flat and stuffs her bra, but you didn’t hear that from us, gamers.

Oof. This is obviously a big drag for everyone who was hoping that we could finally break the cursed ties that bind us and give birth to a beautiful child!

We were as thrilled as anybody in June of 2019 when Nintendo first announced Hyrule Warriors: Age Of Calamity at a Nintendo Direct event. Unfortunately, though, after traveling deep in the woods to the hovel where we first crossed paths with Glynwynda Of The Fens that fateful day, she shoved her bony finger in our faces and confirmed with devilish glee that since the game exists in a separate universe it can’t strictly be considered canon.

We have to admit, we were pretty blindsided by this, readers. Obviously, we’d never try to claim something like Super Smash Bros counted as a Zelda game because it contains characters from the series, or even that the Phillips-developed CD entries like Zelda: The Faces Of Evil and Zelda: The Wand Of Gamelon should be included, but at this point, we can’t help but feeling like the miserable crone is being a real stickler.

Yes, it’s pretty disappointing, especially since we have always dreamed of giving birth to a beautiful baby girl, and now it looks like our dream will never come true. The only real good news is that Age Of Calamity seems pretty fun. It’s got all the classic characters, settings, and objects Zelda fans will love—although it doesn’t have any of the signature puzzles or dungeons that would finally fulfill the terms of the magical bargain and give our mother the grandchild she so desperately wants. On the whole, it looks like a fun and creative way to keep us from thinking about the youthful hubris that led us to mock a wizened old hag for getting killed in the first level of the NES’ Legend Of Zelda all those years ago.

All in all, Age Of Calamity has really whetted our appetite for the next official Zelda game. Here’s hoping Nintendo will be releasing the Breath Of The Wild sequel soon, or that we can locate the powerful enchanted Amulet of Rapacity to finally banish Glynwynda back to the depths of Hell!",402,2269,33,175

Look, we’re just going to say it: This is total bullshit.

After a week of exclusive previews and gameplay teasers, we were unbelievably pumped to finally get our hands on CD Projekt Red’s sprawling new science-fiction RPG. Unfortunately, just as we were about to grab a controller to jump into the neon-lit wonder of Night City, a dozen Projekt Red employees barged through the door, commandeered every single one of the controllers, and haven’t stopped playing for the past 30 minutes. They didn’t even seem to care that there was a massive line of fans who had been waiting for hours to catch a glimpse of the new perk trees and stealth mechanics over their shoulders. Goddamnit.

What’s worse is that we have repeatedly and respectfully asked their designers and coders to step aside and let someone else play, stressing that they must have playtested the game thousands of times by now over the five-year development cycle. But they just either outright ignored us or laughed in our face! It’s unbelievable. There are signs mounted everywhere that say “Limit 15 Minutes”—signs that they mounted themselves—and these pricks don’t even seem to care.
