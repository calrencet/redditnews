Henley Lee Huxiang is the first individual to be prosecuted since China amended its criminal code in March to outlaw the provision of support for activities or entities overseas that would endanger national security.

Wednesday’s “confession” came on the eve of Hong Kong’s first National Security Education Day on Thursday. Beijing insists that the 2019 pro-democracy protests by hundreds of thousands of Hongkongers were incited overseas, a charge denied by those taking part.

The overseas TV channels of Chinese state media have been suspended in the UK and in Australia for airing possibly coerced confessions.

Lee, 66, was arrested in November 2019 for allegedly colluding with people in the United States to fuel protests in Hong Kong and to impose sanctions on the territory, a Communist Party newspaper reported at the time.

He was charged in April 2020 and sentenced to 11 years early this month, according to the Focus Report programme on state television CCTV-13 on Wednesday. Lee appeared in a detailed 13-minute segment that included his purported confessions on camera and comments from officers said to have investigated the case.

“Henley Lee is a typical ‘two-faced man’: he tried hard to appear to be a patriotic businessman when he approached government officials, but in private, he has no qualms about his anti-China attitude,” the report said.

In the video, Lee appeared in a grey T-shirt and a red vest marked with an abbreviated term for “national security custody” and was seen briefly in handcuffs.

Lee gave financial support to Hong Kong activist Alex Chow so he could travel overseas to take part in training and a forum in Europe, the CCTV report alleged. His funding also enabled Nathan Law, Joshua Wong and Sunny Cheung to meet foreign politicians, it said.

Chow and Law both denied knowing Lee and said they had received no funds from him, according to statements they posted to Facebook. Chow said the forum was an event in the Czech Republic promoting democracy and travel fees were sponsored by its organisers.

Lee also allegedly gave funds to a man surnamed Yang, who was connected to politicians in an unnamed western country, according to the TV report. The money was intended to support the election campaigns of these “anti-China” lawmakers in 2018, it said.

Lee moved cash overseas with the help of 20 or 30 of his employees, who each carried no more than the US$5,000 allowed by law each time they left the country, according to his purported confession.

He was consulted by foreign politicians as they drafted legislation that would impose sanctions on China, the report said. He persuaded them not to place restrictions on bonded warehouses and dual-use items, and so the legislation ultimately included more severe measures.

“For a Chinese man to offer these suggestions, causing this western country to place more damaging measures to suppress us, this is behaviour typical of a Chinese traitor,” a police officer said in the report.

Safeguard Defenders, a human rights watchdog which monitors televised “confessions” on Chinese state media, said Lee’s case set a precedent in the reach of the country’s security laws beyond its national borders.

“This is a dangerous precedent that cannot be understated and reflects the brand new provisions in China’s Criminal Law, echoing the extraterritorial aspects of the Hong Kong National Security Law,” the group said in a statement.

Lee is the fifth person in recent months to appear on Focus Report and confess to national security crimes, according to the group. “Like Lee, the other four have all stood accused of crimes against national security, some also for ‘instigating’ protests in Hong Kong. The other four are all Taiwanese citizens.”",675,4182,16,107

The Xinjiang government runs an official ""labour transfer programme"", according to its 2019 Five Year Plan, ""so as to provide more employment opportunities for the surplus rural labour force"".

Workers are ""transferred to employment"" in other provinces of China.

Image: On the Chinese internet, there are hundreds of ads for Uighur labour

A report from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute estimated that at least 80,000 Uighur workers were transferred out of Xinjiang between 2017 and 2019, although it said the actual figure was likely to be far higher.

Human rights groups have warned that such strict controls could amount to forced labour.

The Chinese government has previously described such claims as ""the lie of the century"". It did not respond to our request for comment on this story.

Facilitating labour transfers relies on a network of private agents.

On Chinese websites, there are dozens of postings advertising Uighur labour, in batches of 50 to 100 workers.

Baidu, the company hosting the job postings, did not respond to a request for comment.

Those adverts suggest tight political and social controls. One states that the ""security of workers will be guaranteed by the government"".

Image: Uighur workers would be escorted by buses if they wanted to leave the factory, the owner told us

We contacted numbers left on the labour adverts.

One agent told us that workers from Xinjiang needed to be ""examined politically"" before they could be transferred.

The local government of the receiving province would also do a ""political examination"".

All workers would be accompanied by ""supervisors"", the agent said, and ""under half-military management"".

Another said that without local government approval, workers could not be arranged because ""the ethnic minority issue is a severe problem"".

A third said the salary of the ""supervisors"" was paid by the Personnel Bureau of the Xinjiang government.

Image: Sky News visited seafood processing plants that had used Uighur labour

State media often celebrates the working conditions of Uighur workers in other parts of China.

One local news video describes 200 Uighur workers at a factory in Shandong, a coastal province in east China, saying: ""Supported by all relevant government departments, the company develops well.

""They will continue creating a harmonious work environment for our Uighur compatriots.""

The owner of the factory, a seafood processing plant, said that all the Uighur workers had returned home to Xinjiang because of the pandemic and that reports of forced labour was ""nonsense"".

He said that workers went there because they chose to, earned at least £300 per month, and had air conditioners in their on-site dormitories.

Image: Footage on Chinese state media shows Uighurs celebrating Eid al Adha - thousands of miles away from their homes

Those dormitories were monitored by CCTV in a front office which also contained riot control gear.

If workers wished to leave the factory, the owner told us, the company would take them in two buses.

Twelve police officers and Communist Party officials then arrived.

They questioned us for two hours, before ordering us to leave town.

At another seafood processing factory in the same province, which until recently had a UK subsidiary, according to Companies House filings, a manager waiting at the entrance said there were no Uighur workers, nor had there been in the several years he had worked there.

But an article on the company's own website, posted on 18 March 2020, shows Uighur workers arriving from Xinjiang.

0,Castro era in Cuba to end as Raul confirms he's retiring,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/castro-says-he-is-retiring-will-keep-defending-cubas-1959-revolution-2021-04-16/,"Cuban First Secretary of Communist Party Raul Castro Ruz gives a speech, on January 01, 2019, during the celebration of 60th Anniversary of Cuban Revolution at Santa Ifigenia Cemetery in Santiago de Cuba. Yamil Lage/Pool via Reuters/File Photo

Raul Castro confirmed he was handing over the leadership of the Cuban Communist Party to a younger generation at its congress that kicked off on Friday, ending six decades of rule by himself and older brother Fidel.

In a speech opening the four-day event, Castro, 89, said the new leadership would be party loyalists with decades of experience working their way up the ranks and were ""full of passion and anti-imperialist spirit.""

Castro had said at the previous party congress in 2016 it would be the last one led by the ""historic generation"" who fought in the Sierra Maestra to topple a U.S.-backed dictator in the 1959 leftist revolution.

He already handed over the presidency in 2018 to protege Miguel Diaz-Canel, 60, who ran the party in two provinces before joining the national government.

The new generation of leaders, which did not forge itself through rebellion, has no easy task. The transition comes as Cuba faces the worst economic crisis since the collapse of former benefactor the Soviet Union, while there are signs of growing frustration, especially among younger Cubans.

""I believe fervently in the strength and exemplary nature and comprehension of my compatriots, and as long as I live I will be ready with my foot in the stirrups to defend the fatherland, the revolution and socialism,"" Castro told hundreds of party delegates gathered at a convention center in Havana.

The congress, the party's most important meeting, held every five years to review policy and fix leadership, is a closed-door event but excerpts are being broadcast on state television.

Castro himself became acting president when Fidel fell ill in 2006 and later in 2011 party leader, launching a raft of social and economic reforms to open up one of the world's last Communist-run countries that later stalled.

On Friday, he hailed Diaz-Canel as one of the new generation of leaders that was picking up where he left off.

Castro's olive green military fatigues contrasted with the civil get-up of his protege, who is widely expected to succeed him as party first secretary, the most powerful position in Cuba's one-party system.

Older Cubans said they would miss having a Castro at the helm, although most acknowledged it was time to pass on the baton.

""It's another stage,"" said Maria del Carmen Jimenez, a 72-year old retired nurse, ""but without a double we will miss him.""

Castro denounced renewed U.S. hostility under former President Donald Trump. Incumbent President Joe Biden has vowed to roll back some of Trump’s sanctions, although the White House said on Friday a shift in Cuba policy was not among his top foreign policy priorities.

Castro said Cuba was ready for a ""new type of relationship with the United States without ... Cuba having to renounce the principles of the revolution and socialism.""

PRESSURE TO REFORM

Cuba's new leaders face pressure to speed up reform, particularly economic change, which is foremost on citizens' minds, especially younger Cubans who have known only crisis, analysts say.

A tightening of the decades-old U.S. trade embargo and the coronavirus pandemic have exacerbated a liquidity crisis in Cuba's ailing centrally planned economy. Shortages of even basic goods mean Cubans spend hours lining up to buy groceries.

And Havana has dollarized parts of the economy, leaving those who do not receive remittances from family abroad or did not earn hard currency from tourism struggling to get by. That has eaten away at equality, a pillar of the party's legitimacy.

Since the expansion of internet access in recent years, Cubans are increasingly using social media as a platform to express criticism, while online non-state media are challenging the state monopoly of mass media.

Tight control of public spaces by the authorities means protests are still relatively rare and small-scale, but they are on the increase nationwide on issues as varied as excessive red tape to curbs on civil liberties.

Castro said on Friday it was important to pursue reform with greater ""dynamism"", denouncing - as he has in the past - ""inertia, conformism, the lack of initiative"" in state companies. The government has resumed a set of economic reforms the party agreed on at its 2011 congress in recent months, in particular eradicating Cuba's dual currency, multiple exchange rate system in January.

Yet Castro said reforms fomenting the non-state sector should not go beyond certain limits that would lead to the ""very destruction of socialism and the end of national sovereignty.""

Party militants like Rogelio Machado, a mathematics teacher, say they were confident the new generation was up to walking that tightrope.

""Our country need changes and the new generation is more scientifically prepared to continue the path of socialism,"" he said.

But government critics like ""artivist"" Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, whom Havana accuses of being part of a U.S.-backed soft coup attempt, say the death knell is sounding for the revolution.

“Raul is passing over the power to someone with little charisma and who does not have much popular support,” he said while staging his latest performance against the government, in which he sits in a garrote for the four days of the congress. “This takes us one step closer to democracy.”

0,Olympics on the line as Japan slides back into COVID emergency,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/16/olympics-on-the-line-as-japan-slides-back-into-covid-emergency,"Tougher measures introduced to try and slow spread of COVID-19 that is being driven by new variants.

Tokyo, Japan – With less than 100 days to go before the scheduled opening of the postponed Tokyo Olympics, Japan is witnessing the emergence of a fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic which some fear will dwarf the previous three.

Much to the government’s chagrin, daily coronavirus cases have been on the rise since early March and this week began to cross 4,000 infections a day.

In the 15 months since Japan recorded its first case of COVID-19, there have now been more than 500,000 confirmed infections and nearly 10,000 deaths in the country.

The government of Yoshihide Suga, however, appears determined to host the Tokyo Olympics after the initial one-year delay, and has attempted to downplay the seriousness of the current crisis. It has refused to declare a third “state of emergency.”

But with case numbers swelling and the increasing inability of some regions’ hospitals to cope, some health experts are now speaking up.

Part of the pressure is coming from the nation’s medical leaders, who are voicing concerns despite the administration’s reassurances.

New restrictions and penalities, including early closures for bars and restaurants, have been imposed in an attempt to slow the latest wave of COVID-19 infections [Shane Gibbons/Al Jazeera] Japan Medical Association President Dr Toshio Nakagawa declared on Wednesday that “an early emergency declaration is necessary” in order to stem the spread of the coronavirus.

Dr Haruo Ozaki, the chairman of the Tokyo Medical Association told a local newspaper separately that “if infections spread further, in reality it would be difficult to hold the Olympics in its regular form with athletes coming from various countries, even if the Games are held with no spectators.”

The government’s own top medical adviser, Dr Shigeru Omi, testified to a parliamentary committee this week that “there is no doubt that Japan is entering the fourth wave of infections.”

As of midweek, however, Prime Minister Suga was still trying dismiss such talk, telling the House of Councillors that “new infections have yet to become large waves nationwide.”

But the very next day, his position was undermined by the ruling party’s number-two official, Toshihiro Nikai, who told a television programme that the Olympics might yet need to be called off. “What’s the point of the Olympics if they become responsible for spreading infections?” he asked.

Restrictions imposed

Meanwhile, even as the national government continues to resist calls from the medical community to declare a formal state of emergency, it is gradually expanding the scope of what it now calls “quasi-emergency measures.”

These measures, such as clamping down on nightlife by requiring bars and restaurants to close earlier in the evening, are essentially identical to the state of emergency measures that had been imposed in some regions previously.

The only difference is that they are now backed by the power to impose fines on those who fail to cooperate.

Experts fear the wave of cases that began in Osaka will soon make their way to Tokyo, driven by more infectious variants and the slow pace of the vaccination programme [Michael Penn/Al Al Jazeera] As of Friday, such “quasi-emergency measures” had been authorised in 10 of the nation’s 47 prefectures, including in all of the largest urban centres.

But the restrictions may not be enough to slow the outbreak and experts are pointing to two key reasons why Japan’s fourth wave of COVID-19 could easily become larger than the previous three ones.

The main epicentre of past coronavirus waves was in Osaka Prefecture. But this iteration now threatens Tokyo, Japan’s most populous area. This western prefecture is currently recording more than 1,000 cases on a daily basis – a number that it had never previously hit. The surge has already forced the cancellation of the torch relay there.

It is thought to be only a matter of time before the record-smashing case numbers in Osaka reach Tokyo and other parts of the nation.

Driving these concerns is the second distinctive point about the current wave – most of the new cases in Osaka appear to come from the more infectious COVID-19 variants, rather than the initial version of the virus that fuelled previous waves.

At a Tokyo Medical Association news conference on Wednesday Deputy Chairman Masataka Inokuchi said: “There’s a significant chance that Osaka is the Tokyo of two to three weeks from now.”

Association Chairman Ozaki expressed particular concern about the so-called N501Y mutation, which has already taken hold in the Japanese capital region.

“N501Y is very infectious,” Ozaki warned, “and it’s being said that young people, who were previously not easily infected, are now contracting the virus. It’s important that people of all generations consider getting back to the basics on infection prevention.”

Sluggish vaccination programme

Residents are bracing for tougher public policy measures.

Stephen Zurcher, the dean of Asian Studies at Kansai Gaidai University in Osaka, told Al Jazeera that although his university has only just resumed a policy of allowing students back into the classroom as part of a “hybrid” teaching model, they also know that conditions in the region may soon force them back to a purely online format.

“If [Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura] does decide to go to a full state of emergency and tell people and students to stay home, then of course the school would shut down. We’d have no choice. We’d immediately flip out of this hybrid strategy and move directly to all instruction occurring online,” he said.

An elderly woman receives her coronavirus vaccine shot at a nursing home in Mie Prefecture in central Japan this week. The country has been slow to rollout inoculations compared with other developed countries [Kyodo/via Reuters] Japan can expect little near-term relief from COVID-19 vaccines either.

Although the nation has acquired millions of doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot and will be offering it without charge to all residents, its vaccination programme has been disappointing.

The national government had earlier insisted that the vaccines needed to be tested on ethnic Japanese before granting legal approval. And coordination between ministries and local governments has continued to be sluggish.

The net result is that despite the urgency of preparing for the Olympics, having a national healthcare system and the appointment of a capable minister to oversee the programme – Japan is far behind other advanced nations in getting the vaccine to its people.

So far, less than 1 percent of Japan’s population has received a vaccination, compared with more than 47 percent of the population in the United Kingdom and 37 percent in the United States.

As a result it will be too slow to decisively affect the country’s plans to host the Olympics or hamper the trajectory of the threatening fourth wave.",1128,7011,11,62

REUTERS/Shamil Zhumatov

Moscow expelled 20 Czech diplomats on Sunday in a confrontation over Czech allegations that two Russian spies accused of a nerve agent poisoning in Britain in 2018 were behind an earlier explosion at a Czech ammunition depot that killed two people.

Prague had on Saturday ordered out 18 Russian diplomats, prompting Russia to vow on Sunday to ""force the authors of this provocation to fully understand their responsibility for destroying the foundation of normal ties between our countries"".

Moscow gave the Czech diplomats just a day to leave, while Prague had given the Russians 72 hours.

The Czech Republic said it had informed NATO and European Union allies that it suspected Russia of causing the 2014 blast, and European Union foreign ministers were set to discuss the matter at their meeting on Monday.

The U.S. State Department commended Prague's firm response to ""Russia's subversive actions on Czech soil"". read more

The row is the biggest between Prague and Moscow since the end of decades of Soviet domination of eastern Europe in 1989.

It also adds to growing tensions between Russia and the West in general, raised in part by Russia's military build-up on its Western borders and in Crimea, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014, after a surge in fighting between government and pro-Russian forces in Ukraine's east.

Russia said Prague's accusations were absurd as it had previously blamed the blast at Vrbetice, 300 km (210 miles) east of the capital, on the depot's owners.

It called the expulsions ""the continuation of a series of anti-Russian actions undertaken by the Czech Republic in recent years"", accusing Prague of ""striving to please the United States against the backdrop of recent U.S. sanctions against Russia"".

ARMS SHIPMENT

Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said the attack had been aimed at a shipment to a Bulgarian arms trader.

""This was an attack on ammunition that had already been paid for and was being stored for a Bulgarian arms trader,"" he said on Czech Television.

He said the arms trader, whom he did not name, had later been the target of an attempted murder.

Bulgarian prosecutors charged three Russian men in 2020 with an attempt to kill arms trader Emilian Gebrev, who was identified by Czech media as the same individual. Reuters was unable to reach Gebrev for comment.

Czech police said two men using the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov had travelled to the Czech Republic days before the arms depot blast.

Those names were the aliases used by the two Russian GRU military intelligence officers wanted by Britain for the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok in the English city of Salisbury in 2018. The Skripals survived, but a member of the public died.

The Kremlin denied involvement in that incident, and the attackers remain at large. read more

Czech interior and acting foreign minister Jan Hamacek said police knew about the two people from the beginning, ""but only found out when the Salisbury attack happened that they are members of the GRU, that Unit 29155"".

Hamacek said Prague would ask Moscow for assistance in questioning them, but did not expect it to cooperate.

""DANGEROUS AND MALIGN""

British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab tweeted that the Czechs ""have exposed the lengths that the GRU will go to in their attempts to conduct dangerous and malign operations"".

A NATO official said the alliance would support the Czech Republic as it investigated Russia's ""malign activities"", which were part of a pattern of ""dangerous behaviour"".

""Those responsible must be brought to justice,"" added the official, who declined to be named.

The United States imposed sanctions against Russia on Thursday for interfering in last year's U.S. election, cyber hacking, bullying Ukraine and other actions, prompting Moscow to retaliate.

On Sunday, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Washington had told Moscow ""there will be consequences"" if Alexei Navalny, the opposition figurehead who almost died last year after being given a toxin that Western experts say was Novichok, dies in prison, where he is on hunger strike. read more

The 2014 incident has resurfaced at an awkward time for Prague and Moscow.

The Czech Republic is planning to put the construction of a new nuclear power plant at its Dukovany complex out to tender.

Security services have demanded that Russia's Rosatom be excluded as a security risk, while President Milos Zeman and other senior officials have been putting Russia's case.

In a text message, Industry Minister Karel Havlicek, who was previously in favour of including Russia, told Reuters: ""The probability that Rosatom will participate in the expansion of Dukovany is very low.""

A Nissan spokeswoman was not able to immediately comment.

Carmakers around the world are struggling with a chip shortage caused by strong demand from makers of smartphones and other consumer electronics amid the COVID pandemic. A fire at a Japanese auto chip plant last month has further squeezed supplies.

0,Human Rights Lawyer Steve Donziger faces a court case for criminal contempt after decades fighting to prove Chevron’s responsibility polluting the Amazon rainforest,https://bylinetimes.com/2021/04/15/the-decades-long-persecution-of-human-rights-lawyer-by-oil-giant/,"Steve Donziger faces a court case for criminal contempt after decades fighting to prove Chevron’s responsibility polluting the Amazon rainforest, reports Stephen Delahunty

Share EmailTwitterFacebook

US-based lawyer Steve Donziger has spent more than 600 days of house arrest after enduring what he described as a “corporate political persecution” following decades-long legal battle with the oil giant Chevron.

In 2011, Donziger and a team of Ecuadorian lawyers won a $9.5-billion verdict against Texaco, now Chevron, in a case of massive oil pollution he referred to as the “Amazon Chernobyl”. It is the largest, and arguably the most bitter, human rights and environmental court battle in history.

Since then, a series of litigations involving a US judge acting as prosecutor and jury on behalf of a massive oil company have resulted in a misdemeanor charge brought against the human rights lawyer. The charge carries a maximum sentence of six months in prison.

Donziger’s contempt charge will be heard by Judge Loretta Preska who was on the advisory board of the New York chapter of the Chevron-funded Federalist Society. The Seward & Kissel law firm – that has previously done work for Chevron – will prosecute Donziger after the US Justice Department declined to take the case.

Despite increasing domestic and international calls for the case to be thrown out, this month Preska denied all Zoom access to Donziger’s upcoming trial in a move his lawyers said is designed to limit public access to an unparalleled one-sided case.

Marty Garbus, the lawyer representing Donziger, condemned the move as an “obvious and transparent attempt to hide public scrutiny of a farcical proceeding with a biased judge, no jury, and a private Chevron prosecutor.”

A ‘Lifetime of Litigation’

The history of Donziger’s investigations into reports of pollution in the Lago Agrio region of northern Ecuador began in 1993 – although Texaco had been drilling in this part of the Amazon since the 1960s.

When Chevron bought Texaco in 2001, it argued the oil company had cleaned up its area of operations. Any remaining pollution, it claimed, was the responsibility of its partner Petroecuador.

However, evidence has shown that between 1964 and 1992, Texaco dumped 16 billion gallons of toxic wastewater into rivers and pits. The pollution flowed into rivers and streams used by the indigenous population for drinking water. Amazon Frontlines, a human rights group, estimates there are still 1,785 pools and 704 open pits of toxic wastes registered in the Lago Agrio region.

Judicial site inspections confirmed that the average Chevron waste pit in Ecuador contained 200 times the contamination allowed by US and world standards. This included illegal levels of metals known to damage the immune and reproductive systems and cause cancer. According to Amazon Watch, the company saved about $3 per barrel of oil by ignoring regulations, and earned an extra $5 billion over 20 years.

Donziger travelled to Ecuador hundreds of times while building the case before the legal action eventually went to court. During the trial, Chevron stated that if the victims pursued the case, they faced a “lifetime of litigation.”

After an eight-year trial, in 2011 the court ruled that 30,000 plaintiffs – mostly farmers and indigenous people – should be awarded billions of dollars to clean up the contaminated soil and improve the region’s health facilities.

Two Ecuadorian appeals courts confirmed the decision, and seventeen appellate judges ruled unanimously that Chevron was responsible for the pollution in an area covering 1,700-square miles.

The historic victory was short-lived.

Chevron claimed Donziger’s team ghost wrote a supposedly independent assessment and offered a $500,000 bribe to sway the judgment.

Donziger denied any wrongdoing and Ecuador’s Supreme Court later affirmed the original ruling, but Chevron refused to pay and sold up all its assets in the country.

Chevron then hired law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher – previously censured by England’s High Court of Justice for fabricating evidence – to file a ‘racketeering’ case against Donziger. This charge is normally reserved for prosecuting organised crime syndicates.

Judge Kaplan at the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York agreed to hear the case. However, on the eve of the trial Chevron dropped its financial claims which allowed Kaplan to dismiss the jury and decide the outcome himself.

A key Chevron witness was Alberto Guerra – a former Ecuadorian judge who had historically testified that he accepted bribes.

Guerra claimed that Donziger had approved a “bribe” to an Ecuadorian judge and written the final court ruling for the judge, allegedly transferred on a computer thumb drive. No corroborating evidence was ever offered. Guerra later admitted lying about these facts, proven by an investigation of his computer.

Despite this, Kaplan found Donziger conducted a “pattern of racketeering activity” which made him liable for millions of dollars in Chevron’s legal costs.

The oil company was also granted seizure of his laptop and cellphone, which Donziger refused.

This resulted in the current charge of ‘criminal contempt’ and Kaplan assigning the case to Judge Preska in August 2019.

Donziger has been under house arrest since.

In a lengthy statement sent to Byline Times, a spokesman for Chevron contended that an international tribunal in 2017 had confirmed the Ecuadorian decision was “fraudulent” and he denied the company had persecuted Donziger.

However, Ecuador is appealing this particular tribunal decision. The appeal is administered by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, in part on its findings of judicial fraud in the case.

Ecuador’’s attorney general, Inigo Salvador, said “it worries us that the tribunal is asking a country to lift a sentence of one of its courts that was issued as part of a dispute between private parties.”

A Corporate Political Prosecution

Donziger has been unable to practice law while detained. He says his battle with Chevron has come at a huge personal, family and financial cost.

“I never thought this could happen in the US,” Donziger said. He explained how he believes this his case is designed to give a warning and marks the opening of a new front in the war against environmental defenders.

“This is a corporate political prosecution,” he added. His lawyers have estimated the oil giant has spent over $2 billion on 2,000 lawyers, public relations teams, and private investigators.

However, Donziger has global allies. The Law Students for Climate Accountability organised a national boycott of the firm for its willingness to “use its legal skills in the interest of high paying companies.”

More than 475 international lawyers, bar associations, and human rights advocates signed a letter criticising Kaplan’s ruling for persecuting Donziger “based on false witness testimony provided by Chevron, personal animus, and… to protect Chevron from a valid foreign court judgment.”

The letter added: “Such arbitrary detention sets a dangerous precedent for human rights attorneys in the United States and around the world.”

They’re joined by the European Parliament, who has called for an investigation into Chevron’s and Gibson Dunn’s conduct.

Additionally, more than 50 Nobel laureates have made their feelings clear in a letter of support for Donziger and the indigenous peoples and communities in Ecuador and their decades-long struggle for environmental justice. It states: “[Chevron’s] goal is to intimidate and disempower the victims of its pollution and a lawyer who has worked for decades on their behalf.”

Amnesty International has also called on the US justice department to conduct a criminal investigation into the oil company and Gibson Dunn’s conduct, witness bribery, and fraud in the Ecuador pollution litigation.

A Dirtier Turn

As the trial draws closer, The Daily Dot discovered last month that searches for terms related to the case on Google throw up sponsored ads by Chevron, in an attempt to bump down articles that are more favorable and sympathetic to Donziger.

It’s also using public relations wires to help push its story, as well as an actual sock puppet Twitter account from their PR head.

A spokesman for Chevron told Byline Times that the oil giant is not involved in the contempt case.

“Donziger has no one to blame but himself for his problems,” the spokesman said. “The court initiated the pending criminal case against him.”

Rick Friedman, Donziger’s longtime counsel, said the case illustrates the wisdom of the founding fathers in having “checks and balances” in the Government, and called on the US Justice Department to intervene and dismiss the case outright.

“The judiciary has ignored the executive branch which is ordinarily in charge of prosecutions. It has eliminated a jury, which historically has been a bulwark against judicial overreach. It is punishing a defendant before he has been convicted. If the trial does happen, it is imperative that an unbiased judge and disinterested prosecutor be assigned to the case.”

Despite his cases’ narrative turning into one of his own persecution, Donziger reminded his supporters there are ten of thousands people in Ecuador still awaiting justice for a massive environmental pollution.

His trial for criminal contempt is scheduled to begin behind closed doors next month.

1,Third Amendment Rights Group Celebrates Another Successful Year,https://www.theonion.com/third-amendment-rights-group-celebrates-another-success-1819569379,"WASHINGTON, DC—The National Anti- Quartering Association, America's foremost Third Amendment rights group, held its annual gala in Washington Monday to honor 191 consecutive years of advocating the protection of private homes and property against the unlawful boarding of military personnel.

""This is a proud day for quarters-owners everywhere,"" said the organization's president, Charles Davison, in his keynote address. ""Year after year, we have sent a loud and clear message to the federal government and to anyone else who would attack our unassailable rights: Hands off our cottages, livery stables, and haylofts.""

The NAQA was created in 1816 in response to repeated violations of the Third Amendment during the War of 1812. The organization quickly grew in influence and cites its vigilance as the primary reason why the amendment has only been litigated once in a federal court since the Bill of Rights was ratified. The organization is also arguably the country's most powerful political lobby; every politician elected since 1866 has fully supported Third Amendment rights.

""The framers of the Constitution provided the American people with the right to have their homes free of troops unless Congress mandates otherwise during a time of war,"" Davison said. ""Thanks to our tireless efforts, six generations of civilians have never known the cruelty and duress of quartering unruly foot soldiers.""

Davison recalled the ""dark days"" of 1982, when the federal case of Engblom v. Carey threatened to strip Americans of their fundamental Third Amendment freedoms. The ruling by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals acknowledged that the State of New York had indeed violated the Third Amendment rights of the plaintiffs. The case, according to Davison, was ""a chilling reminder of how even an established 200-year-old right hangs by a slender thread.""

""I don't think people fully understand how close we came to completely losing such a basic right,"" Davison said. ""If the Second Circuit had ruled otherwise, we'd be living in a world in which soldiers would be quartering amok upon our very hearthstones.""

Davison expressed pride in the NAQA's grassroots involvement at the local level, citing the association's direct-mailing campaigns and its fully staffed regional centers where citizens can report Third Amendment rights abuses. The NAQA also holds quartering-safety seminars for citizens interested in learning how to effectively defend their households against U.S. troops seeking shelter.

Davison reiterated the organization's promise to oppose pro-quartering legislation should any ever be proposed.

""Keep the fat hands of soldiers out of America's larders!"" Davison said to rousing applause. He was quoting the NAQA's familiar slogan, which can be found on T-shirts, bumper stickers, and other merchandise sold on the group's website.

Davison ended his address by warning of the dangers of the NAQA resting on its laurels.

""Pro-quartering advocates are waiting for just the right moment to stick a bunch of troops in our homes,"" Davison said. ""Well, I say to them that we will never allow this to happen. You can count on the true patriots of the NAQA to ensure that no chickens and livestock will be appropriated, and private stores of salt, brandy, candles, and vinegar will stay firmly where they belong: in civilian hands.""

The NAQA is known for its quick and aggressive mobilization when it believes Third Amendment rights are at risk, and has rushed to the defense of homeowners it believes are being illegally coerced into housing American soldiers. Last month, 200 NAQA members marched on a private residence in Fairfax, VA after receiving a tip that the owners were being victimized by three Navy seamen demanding prolonged quartering. They ended their demonstration, however, when it was discovered that the sailors were brothers on shore leave visiting their parents.

Davison, 49, has headed the NAQA since January, replacing longtime president Lawrence Frost. Frost, 58, left the organization to chair the Citizens Committee for the Right to Drink, a 21st Amendment rights group committed to the continued legal status of alcohol for Americans of drinking age.",661,4257,8,63

Though plague and console shortages mark these lands, we have heard tale of a forgotten city beyond the endless sands, a city where the cobbled streets are paved with PS5s, where games burst forth from the fountains in waves like water, and DualSense controllers hang from the crooked trees like so many leaves.

Join us, you downcast and beaten followers of OGN, on a journey to an eldritch land of unspeakable gaming fortune.

Though our misbegotten realm’s console supply has grown fallow in these merciless days, there was a lice-ridden dotard—near insane with syphilis and drink—who whispered of an eldritch citadel far beyond the idle wastelands where each brick composed of PS5 standard and digital editions. There, mute and dumb faces peek from windows wearing strings of DualSense controllers around their necks as if they were mere trinkets. One can simply dip a wicker basket in the river and emerge with hundreds of copies of Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales. Or so the lunatic fool told us, at least. At first, we cast off these tales as the ravings of starved and deranged minds, but we could not help but dream. What if it is real, gamers? What if?

Over the mountains that burn in the land of eternal sun, and through the deepest canyons where man-eating chimeras prowl every turn, that is where we will find spires ascending to the sky built of nothing but AMD graphics cards, solid-state hard drives, and 8-core processors. The house of every peasant bedecked with painted consoles, filled with overflowing chests of every next-gen game. A friend of the drunkard—an outdoorsman and scout by training—who came to us with a tattered PS5 power cord claims to have seen this Xanadu. He says that PS5s are so common that they are used as ballast on rough-hewn fishing junks, and the shoeless children of the poor entertain this bizarre realm’s royalty by kicking them around like balls. He also claims his expedition faltered when his partners went mad with greed and drowned trying to carry hundreds of the Sony consoles across the raging river that marks the boundary of this ancient land. He says the locals reclaimed their bodies.



This scout is the gentleman who shall lead us to the boundary of this land, gamers, although he swears he will go no farther. And you—if you also seek the bounty of immersive graphics and haptic feedback that lies hidden just beyond our reach—he will lead you, too.



We have 200 camels and horses, gamers, laden with waterskins, salted mutton, and fully charged Nintendo Switches. We have firearms and native guides who have promised to show us the way. It will not be easy. Many of us will likely perish, if not of hunger or heat stroke than of some unknown exotic disease, or in the teeth of a fierce beast for which words and drawings cannot prepare us. But we will not be deterred by the failures of past parties. Gaming glory awaits us. We will return with more PS5s than the world has ever seen and go down emblazoned in the annals of all recorded time. Will you join our company to seek this strange and unknown land? Will you make history with us, gamers?",549,3186,26,146

There is a unique beauty in the way each practitioner suppresses their gag reflex in order to swallow processed meat as efficiently as possible, and the poignancy of these genuine aesthetic achievements are trivialized when we make it all about winning and losing. Eating so many hot dogs that it makes you violently ill should be a reward unto itself.” Aveline went on to suggest that competitors like world champion eater Joey Chestnut were really more about sex appeal than artistry.",233,1387,15,84

Islamist party Tehreek-e-Labbaik played a major role in fomenting this week’s anti-French protests in Pakistan, prompting Islamabad to announce the group’s dissolution on Thursday as France’s embassy told French nationals to leave the country over safety fears.

The Pakistani government blocked social media and instant messaging apps for several hours on Friday to try to prevent further violence, a day after Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed announced the dissolution of Tehreek-e-Labbaik (TLP) under the country's anti-terrorism law.

The party’s leader, Saad Rivzi, was arrested on Monday, hours after he called for a new march demanding the expulsion of the French ambassador. His detention triggered days of unrest.

After emerging from the socially conservative Barelvi school of Islam – which is the dominant strain in Pakistan, officially an ""Islamic Republic"" – the TLP has established itself as a major player in Pakistani politics by campaigning for the death penalty for anyone found guilty of blasphemy, which remains a criminal offence in the country.

“TLP was originally created as a political movement to demand the release of a bodyguard accused of having assassinated the governor of the Punjab region in 2011,” explained Jean-Luc Racine, a specialist in the Indian subcontinent and an emeritus research director at the CNRS think-tank in Paris. In 2015 it became a political party headed by Khadim Hussein Rizvi, the father of the current leader.

France became one of the TLP’s targets when the Charlie Hebdo trial started in September 2020. The gruesome massacre of 12 people at the satirical weekly’s office in January 2015 was the first major incident in a wave of Islamist violence in which more than 250 people have since been killed in France.

A month after the start of the trial, France was shaken by the October 16 beheading of teacher Samuel Paty by a Chechen Islamist militant outraged by his decision to share Charlie Hebdo’s controversial cartoons of the prophet Mohammed in a class discussing freedom of expression. Paty showed the images to his civics class while emphasising that students could choose not to look at them if they were offended.

In response to Paty’s murder, President Emmanuel Macron vowed that France would never give up its liberal Enlightenment values, including the right to mock religion. He hailed the slain teacher as a “hero” for representing the secular, free-thinking values of the French Republic. France has a long tradition of caricatures taking on political and religious authorities – including Charlie Hebdo’s mockery of Catholicism.

The weeks that followed saw mass protests in Muslim countries – with people taking to the streets and burning French flags and images of the French president. In Pakistan, the TLP played a central role in fomenting the demonstrations. The party demanded that Pakistan sever diplomatic relations with France and send the French ambassador, Marc Baréty, packing.

The Pakistani government signed an agreement with the party to convince it to dial down the protests – agreeing to the boycott of French products and promising a parliamentary vote by April 20 on expelling the French ambassador.

But as that deadline approached, Islamabad distanced itself from the TLP – a position underscored by Rizvi’s arrest on April 12. More than 200 TLP activists were arrested during the subsequent clashes with police. At least two police officers were killed and at least 340 people were wounded.

The TLP’s electoral strength has so far between limited. In the 2018 parliamentary elections it won just 2 million votes in a country with a population exceeding 210 million. But the party wields influence through its formidable capacity to mobilise its activists. “That’s its strength,” Racine said. “The TLP can get a huge quantity of protesters onto the streets and block roads for days.”

Demand for Asia Bibi’s execution

In 2017, the TLP spearheaded protests in the Pakistani capital Islamabad over a minor change to the oath taken by electoral candidates referring to the Prophet Muhammad. The government said it was a “clerical error” and soon U-turned. But the demonstrations continued – with at least six people killed and some 200 people injured – until Pakistan’s federal law minister resigned, acceding to the protesters’ demand.

The Islamist party then gained international notoriety in 2018, when the Asia Bibi affair hit the world’s headlines. A member of Pakistan’s persecuted Christian minority, she was arrested in 2010 for alleged blasphemy and spent eight years on death row until she was acquitted. In response to her acquittal, the TLP organised mass demonstrations calling for her to be sentenced to death.

“The TLP is relatively popular among young people, especially in the Pakistani working class,” Racine said. “That is because the party’s policy platform is not just about changing how Islam is practiced in the country – but also about tackling Pakistan’s socioeconomic inequality. This obviously speaks to young people in precarious positions, who are losing out under the current system.”

“This week’s events show that Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government is unable to negotiate with radical movements,” Racine continued. “They’re popular among large sections of the population – so the government finds it difficult to take a firm stance against them.”

Pakistani journalist Zahid Hussain expressed a similar view in the country’s English-language daily Dawn: “The government only managed to postpone the crisis. What has been happening now was inevitable. The way the administration has collapsed in the face of mob violence is alarming to say the least, and underscores how we are failing to deal with rising religious extremism.”

So why did the Pakistani government change tack and decide to shut down the TLP entirely?

“They could be thinking that dissolving the TLP might help improve Pakistan’s image abroad, seeing as the country has long been criticised for financing terrorism,” Racine said, although he noted that there is no evidence the TLP has “anything to do with other terrorist groups present in Pakistan, including the Taliban”.

An anonymous Pakistani diplomatic source told French newspaper Le Figaro on Thursday that “Pakistan wants to normalise relations with France” and that “Pakistan’s interior minister publicly expressed his concern on Wednesday that his country’s reputation is suffering because of the TLP’s actions”.

But Racine warned that getting rid of the party would by no means get rid of the movement: “There’s been a repeated phenomenon in Pakistani history in which the government bans radical groups and then they re-emerge in other forms and with other names.”

Although protests have died down since Friday, Racine said “it remains to be seen how TLP activists will act without a leader and without an institutional framework” after Rizvi’s arrest and the group’s official dissolution.

Climate change has proved a thorny issue for the Conservative Party under leader Erin O'Toole. Most Conservative delegates voted against recognizing climate change as a real threat at a policy convention last month.

""We will scrap (Liberal Prime Minister) Justin Trudeau's carbon tax on working Canadians,"" O'Toole said at that convention, noting however that the party ""fought and lost two elections against a carbon tax.""

O'Toole said his own plan was better than the Liberal one. Carbon pricing imposes fees on the use of carbon-based fuels such as oil either through charges for emissions or by adding to the price of gasoline and other fuels.

Trudeau's national carbon price is due to ramp up to C$170 a ton by 2030, though 90% is returned to Canadian taxpayers through rebates. The Conservatives would cap prices at C$50 a ton for taxpayers, who would pay the levy into a government savings account and be able to use the money to make ""green"" purchases like bicycles.

A number of provinces - including the energy heartland and Conservative Party bastion of Alberta - oppose carbon pricing, and challenged the government's scheme in the Supreme Court. Last month, the court upheld Trudeau's plan. read more

""Any new climate plan...must minimize the costs on Albertans and on our trade-exposed industries while at the same time, continuing to responsibly reduce emissions from Alberta,"" Alberta Environment Minister Jason Nixon said.

O'Toole said a Conservative government would meet Canada's international pledge to cut emissions 30% below 2005 levels by 2030, and match greenhouse gas reductions promised in the Liberal climate plan.

""It's outrageous that O'Toole is now planning to hammer Canadians with higher fuel bills through his very own carbon tax,"" said Franco Terrazzano, the Canadian Taxpayers Federation's Alberta director.

Many Liberal insiders expect Trudeau to seek an election later this year. Trudeau's Liberals lead O'Toole's Conservatives 37% to 29%, according an Abacus Data poll published on Thursday.

The United States and NATO have been alarmed by the build-up at the border and in Crimea, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Last weekend Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan called for an end to the ""worrying"" situation in eastern Ukraine's Donbass region and offered Ankara's support. read more

Russia subsequently said Turkey and other nations should not feed ""belligerent sentiment"" in Ukraine.

Speaking in an interview on broadcaster NTV, Cavusoglu said NATO member Turkey had good ties with both Russia and Ukraine.

""We are making the same call to both countries for issues to be resolved peacefully,"" he said. ""We are not picking sides between the countries. Our stance is clear: balanced and constructive.""

Turkey has forged close cooperation with Russia over conflicts in Syria, Libya and Nagorno-Karabakh, as well as in the defence and energy areas. But it criticised the annexation of Crimea and supports Ukraine's territorial integrity. It also sold drones to Kyiv in 2019.

Last week Turkey said the United States would send two warships to the Black Sea, in a move Russia called an unfriendly provocation. On Wednesday Turkish diplomatic sources said Washington had cancelled the deployment. read more

Cavusoglu said Washington had informed Ankara of the decision. He said any future deployment would require a 15-day notice period under the 1936 Montreux Convention, which grants Turkey control over the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits that connect the Black Sea and Mediterranean, and limits warships' access.

""If the U.S. ships don't pass the straits today, the 15-day notice period starts all over again. Non-coastal states need to convey notices 15 days in advance,"" Cavusoglu said.

And, in your view, do you think it would be appropriate for the attorney general—the nation’s chief law enforcement officer—to exact retribution for a slight that, in all fairness, was not at all personal in nature?” At press time, a visibly nervous McConnell had begun asking Garland about his stance on head starts.

Gone would be the persistent frustration of dying in a boss fight or while entering a new zone and having to wait three minutes to jump back into the fray. Little did we know, this power comes with a dark lining. Reports out today suggest that Xbox Series X and PS5 loading screens are going too fast for gamers to read the tips and tricks displayed in the corner of the screen, and everyone has now forgotten how to play video games.

Pandora’s box has been unleashed with these lightning fast loading times, and as a result, outright chaos has been loosed about the video game world.

“I was trying to play Demon’s Souls, and before I even got a chance to read a tip on how to dodge roll, I was thrown into this area called The Nexus and had absolutely no idea how to move or interact with anything,” said Kyle Stanfield, 32, one of millions of gamers worldwide who set their controller down in confusion after having mere moments to grasp the game’s combat and healing suggestions. “I thought there’d been a mistake, so I reloaded it hoping to have a few minutes to learn about the lore of the Regeneration Ring or how to spend my Souls to upgrade a weapon. But then I was just right back into the game again and had no idea what to do.”

“That’s when I started screaming,” said Stanfield.



Everywhere across the globe, gamers are reportedly reacting with confusion, anger, and outright horror to their lack of access to loading screens giving them tips on class customization or how to invert shooting controls in the option screen. Sources have confirmed that many have forgotten how their joystick worked, while others reacted by simply setting their controller down, standing up, and walking directly into their television. Some have even forgotten the entire concept of video games, tearfully begging friends and family members to explain how they—a being of flesh and blood—could possibly interact with a digital character on a television screen.



What we now know is that having a few minutes to read an introduction to a new enemy type or enchanted blade is utterly essential to knowing how to play a video game without going insane. But for the huge swath of gamers who have smashed their DualSense out of fear after it started shaking because they missed the explanation that “controller rumbles will tip you off to in-game secrets,” it may already be too late.



In the rush to make our gaming experiences more seamless, we accidentally removed one of the pillars holding up gaming. The edifice is crumbling, readers, and we do not know how to shore it up.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Kin Cheung/AP Kin Cheung/AP

BEIJING — Nine veteran activists and lawmakers in Hong Kong have been sentenced to prison terms of up to 18 months because of their participation in anti-government protests nearly two years ago.

Media mogul Jimmy Lai received one year in prison, while prominent lawyers Margaret Ng and Martin Lee received suspended sentences of 12 and 11 months respectively, meaning if they are not convicted of another crime in the next two years, they will not have to spend time behind bars. The heaviest sentence of 18 months was meted out to Lee Cheuk-yan, an activist and former lawmaker.

The nine are the most prominent figures in Hong Kong to be sent to prison thus far as Beijing mounts several waves of arrests in the aftermath of widespread protests against its control of the region. They were convicted earlier this month of participating in two unauthorized but peaceful protests in August 2019.

Those protests were part of a larger political movement that began peacefully and attracted record numbers of marchers from all walks of life in Hong Kong. But demonstrations occasionally turned violent, after Beijing and Hong Kong's chief executive, Carrie Lam, refused to budge on more far-reaching demands for democratic reform, such as the ability to directly vote for Hong Kong's next leader.

Now, Beijing is enacting a series of new rules in Hong Kong to cement its hold and prevent future political opposition.

Since the protests ended early last year, China has expelled four opposition lawmakers from Hong Kong's legislature. Beijing then rammed through new rules that give it effective control over how the legislature and the region's chief executive are selected. Around 50 activists who pioneered a sweeping win for Hong Kong's pro-democratic parties and were strategizing to win bigger legislative elections have been arrested. A national security law, not yet a year old, has made political dissent effectively impossible.

""The law should give protection for rights, not take them away,"" said Margaret Ng, 73, a prominent lawyer, speaking before her sentencing.

Those sentenced are notable for not only their influence but their seniority. Eight out of the nine sentenced are over the age of 60, and all of them have, in various ways, shaped Hong Kong's political and legal landscape since it left British rule in 1997.

Also among those in court Friday were former lawmakers Au Nok-hin, Leung Kwok-hung, Leung Yiu-chung, Lee Cheuk-yan, Albert Ho and Cyd Ho.

More than 10,000 people have been arrested for their participation in 2019's protests. Most have been released on bail and have yet to be tried.

Three of those sentenced on Friday — Ng, Lee and lawmaker Ho — have been deemed by Chinese state media as part of the ""Gang of Four,"" which Beijing sees as the primary orchestrators behind the mass demonstrations.

""What we're seeing is the Hong Kong legal system is becoming basically a Hong Kong control system,"" says Mark Simon, a longtime business associate of Lai's who lives in Taiwan.

Media tycoon Lai likely faces the longest stint in prison. He has yet to be tried for six additional charges — one for alleged fraud over the office lease for his media company, Apple Media, and two charges in relation to ""colluding with foreign forces"" under the national security law Beijing implemented last June. He could face life in prison for falling foul of those laws.

Lai, a frequent visitor to Washington, D.C., has met several times with senior American officials, including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

Lai has been in jail since last December after being arrested and denied bail for his national security charge.

""He's reading a lot,"" said Simon. ""He's worried about his family's health every once in a while. But he's incredibly bored, and he would probably happy to be out of jail.""

Earlier this month, Lai released a handwritten letter from prison: ""It is precisely this that we need to love and cherish ourselves. The era is falling apart before us, and it is time for us to stand tall,"" it said.

Ho, the former lawmaker, and lawyer Martin Lee gave short comments outside the courtroom before being sentenced Friday amid shouts from both their supporters and pro-Beijing demonstrators. Ho was sentenced to one year.

""The most important thing is to continue to have hope, as long as there is hope, everything It will succeed,"" Lee said. He also told reporters outside the courtroom where he was sentenced that he had slept well the night before and was ""at peace.""",769,4643,9,63

The announcement was made on Friday by Dr Sasa, who has been designated by the dismissed parliament as representative to the United Nations.

“For the first time in our history, Myanmar has a unity government,” he declared on social media, posting the document showing Win Myint as president and Aung San Suu Kyi as state counsellor.

Myanmar’s acting Vice President Mahn Win Khaing Than was appointed interim prime minister. Dr Sasa himself has been designated as the union minister in international cooperation.

Today, at the end of Thingyan on the eve of Myanmar’s new year, we are proud to announce the formation of a new National Unity Government and the dawn of a new era for the people of Myanmar.

The latest development comes as thousands of people staged different forms of protests nationwide – from the “silent strike” in Yangon to protest marches in Mandalay and elsewhere – against the February 1 coup and denouncing the violent crackdown that killed more than 700 people.

Photos circulating on social media showed Myanmar’s old capital looking like a ghost town as the usually busy streets and intersections are left completely empty. Some vehicles were seen passing by in the downtown area of Yangon, supposedly teeming with people marking the country’s New Year festival.

“Let’s make the roads silent,” protest leader Ei Thinzar Maung posted on her Facebook page. “We have to stage a Silent Strike to show our sorrow for the martyrs who have scarified [sacrificed] their lives. The most silent voice is the loudest.”

Friday is the third day of the five-day traditional Buddhist New Year holiday, known as Thingyan.

Most people this year are shunning the usual festivities to focus on their campaign against the generals who overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi’s government and locked up with many others.

Defiant civilians

In Mandalay, thousands of masked protesters marched carrying huge banners calling for the military to stand down.

Thousands of people also marched in Hpakant, the jade town in Kachin state.

In the Sagaing region, hundreds of protesters rode their vehicles and waved the flag of the National League for Democracy (NLD) of the country’s overthrown leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

On Thursday, a protest organiser in the region, Wai Moe Naing, was detained by the military.

Similar scenes of defiant civilians on their motorbikes were seen along the coast of the Tanintharyi region.

In Loikaw, the capital of Kayah state, hundreds of protesters gathered in an open field to stage a sticky rice ball strike, according to photos posted on social media by the Kantarawaddy Times.

Noise pollution from ship engines, trawling activities, oil platforms, subsea mining and other human sources declined significantly last spring, say the researchers, who are part of a collaborative network of 231 non-military hydrophones.

They believe the relative hush can provide valuable comparative data for an unplanned experiment in how sound affects whales, coral and other marine species.

Like light pollution on the land, human noise is a growing concern in the oceans because it has been proven to disrupt species that depend on sound for communication and navigation. Low-frequency signals can travel thousands of kilometres.

Studies in the north-east Pacific showed an increase of 3 decibels each decade in human-generated sounds below 100 hertz between the 1960s and early 2000s. By one reckoning, the volume of this audio pollution is now around the same level as the natural background noise of the ocean.

This faded substantially last year at the height of lockdown in March, April and May, starting – like Covid – around China and then spreading worldwide. The volume surged back to a new height in the summer as shipping companies rushed to make up for lost time. Sound levels have now stabilised close to the average for recent years.

Scientists have retrospectively declared 2020 “the year of the quiet ocean” and the data from this exceptional period will be published in the coming months in scientific journals.

“Be prepared for exciting results,” said Jesse Ausubel, the director of the Program for the Human Environment at the Rockefeller University. The oceans are unlikely to be as quiet as during April 2020 for many decades to come.

The softening of human sound was most evident in coastal areas and shipping lanes. Jennifer Miksis-Olds, the director of the Center for Acoustics Research and Education at the University of New Hampshire, said this created conditions for a “natural experiment. Since the Industrial Revolution, she said, human noise has masked the ambient sounds of wind, waves and ice and forced marine life to adapt in a similar way to customers in a noisy restaurant, who have to raise their voices or repeat themselves to be understood.

This is part of a bigger project. Ausubel is the founder of the International Quiet Ocean Experiment, a 10-year plan launched in 2015 to create a time series of measurements of ambient sound in many ocean locations. Part of the goal is create evidence to persuade ship operators, oil and gas facilities and jetski users to dampen their decibels for the sake of marine ecosystems.

“We’d like the word soundscape to become a lot better known. Sound is light in the oceans. It illuminates the ocean for many animals. They use it to communicate, to hunt, and can be harmed by noise at excess,” Ausubel said.

He and colleagues – including specialists at St Andrews – plan to expand the hydrophone network, particularly in the southern hemisphere, to more than 500 devices. Using modelling and data collaborations with shipping companies and other ocean users, they hope to produce a global map of ocean sound within the coming years. This should reveal important patterns, such as increases in noise along shipping lanes and near oilfields and windfarms, which could prove as important for ocean health and regulation as roadside air pollution monitoring, or water-contamination measurements near factories.

There is a long way to go. Currently, there are relatively detailed soundscapes of busy areas, such as the North Sea, and then piecemeal, one-off studies from other regions. Filling in the gaps will require a major effort to share data and make reporting consistent across time and place.

Two important steps in this direction were announced this week with the launch of a new software tool, known as Manta (Making Ambient Noise Trends Accessible) and developed by an international team of experts coordinated by Miksis-Olds, to standardise ocean sound recording data. There have also been tests of a new platform to share acoustic data worldwide, the Open Portal to Underwater Sound (Opus), which is being hosted by the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany.

Ausubel compared the recent developments in the soundscape network to the completion of a ring of satellites around the equator in 1979. Back then, there was a party in the World Meteorological Office in Geneva to celebrate the fact that scientists could monitor the entire atmosphere for the first time.

“We are now at the onset of an era in which we can observe ocean soundscapes in much the same way,” he predicted.",777,4773,13,73
1,Zookeepers Confirm Pandas Not Mating Because They’re Scared Of Messing Up Friendship,https://www.theonion.com/zookeepers-confirm-pandas-not-mating-because-they-re-sc-1846467554,"MEMPHIS, TN—Citing the complications that a sexual relationship inevitably brings, officials at the Memphis Zoo confirmed Monday that giant pandas Ya Ya and Le Le had not mated because they were both worried about messing up their friendship. “While securing the future of their species is absolutely crucial, it could never be worth risking what they have together as friends,” said senior curator Andrew Wentz, who praised the Chinese pandas for the maturity they had displayed in resisting “one cheap night of pleasure” in favor of the far greater rewards of a platonic friendship characterized by loyalty and mutual respect. “As zookeepers, we’d love nothing more than to have a few little cubs running around the habitat, but we completely respect their decision. We’re just glad their friendship survived that time Le Le made a pass at Ya Ya in the feeding pen. She didn’t reciprocate, and thankfully he backed off right away, before things could get too weird.” Wentz noted this was especially fortunate considering the pandas haven’t seen any other members of their species for a couple decades and have to share space that, when you’re a giant bear, gets kind of tight.",195,1178,12,84
1,Black Guy Asks Nation For Change,https://politics.theonion.com/black-guy-asks-nation-for-change-1819569703,"CHICAGO—According to witnesses, a loud black man approached a crowd of some 4,000 strangers in downtown Chicago Tuesday and made repeated demands for change.

""The time for change is now,"" said the black guy, yelling at everyone within earshot for 20 straight minutes, practically begging America for change. ""The need for change is stronger and more urgent than ever before. And only you—the people standing here today, and indeed all the people of this great nation—only you can deliver this change.""

The black guy is oddly comfortable demanding change from people he's never even met.

It is estimated that, to date, the black man has asked every single person in the United States for change.

""I've already seen this guy four times today,"" Chicago-area ad salesman Blake Gordon said. ""Every time, it's the same exact spiel. 'I need change.' 'I want change.' Why's he so eager for all this change? What's he going to do with it, anyway?""

After his initial requests for change, the black man rambled nonstop on a variety of unrelated topics, calling for affordable health care, demanding that the government immediately begin withdrawing troops from Iraq, and proposing a $75 billion economic stimulus plan to create new jobs.

""What a wacko,"" Schaumburg, IL resident Patrick Morledge said. ""And, of course, after telling us all about how he had the ability to magically fix everything, he went right back to asking for change. Typical.""

""If he's really looking for change, he's got the wrong guy,"" Morledge added.

Reports indicate that the black man has been riding from city to city across the country, asking for change wherever he goes. Citizens in Austin, TX said they spotted the same guy standing on the street Friday, shouting far-fetched ideas about global warming. Cleveland residents also reported seeing him in a local park, wildly gesticulating and quoting from the Bible. And last week, patrons at the Starlight Diner in Cheyenne, WY claimed that the black man accosted them while they were eating, repeatedly requesting change.

""I saw him walk in and I knew he was headed straight for our table,"" said mother of three Gladys Davies. ""He just stood there smiling at us for a while, and asked how our food tasted. Then he went and did the same thing at the next table over. The nerve of some people.""

Those who encountered the black man Tuesday said he engaged in erratic behavior, including pointing at random people in the crowd and desperately saying he needs their help, going up to complete strangers and hugging them, and angrily claiming that he is not looking for just a little bit of change, but rather a great deal of change, and that he wants it ""right now.""

Advertisement

""I'll be honest, when that black guy said he would 'stop at nothing' to get change, it kind of scared me,"" local mechanic Phil Nighbert said. ""Just leave me alone.""

Though many were taken aback by the black man's brazen demands, some, such as Jackson, MS's Holly Moser, sympathized with him. She gave the black man credit for boldly standing up and asking every last person around him for change.

Advertisement

""I told him I'd give him some if I saw him later, even though I probably won't,"" Moser said. ""Very nice man, though.""

Most, however, ignored his requests.

""I'm a hardworking American who pays his taxes, and the last thing I need is some guy on the street demanding change from me,"" said William Overkamp, a Springfield, IL gun-shop owner.

I thought I’d be able to breeze through the NFC South, but they actually have Panthers plays in here that I’ve never seen before.

Brussels has long been condemned for its use of fishing super trawlers in the world's oceans. They are enormous vessels and can be over 300-feet long, often staying at sea for weeks or months catching thousands of tonnes of fish. Their supersized nets - sometimes a mile long - result in bycatch that includes dolphins, porpoises and seals.

The EU was recently accused of operating a ""neocolonial"" hold over the Indian Ocean after it proposed insufficient measures to tackle overfishing of yellowfin tuna while simultaneously being the largest fisher of the ""near threatened"" species. And, according to The Daily Telegraph, EU super trawlers will continue to encroach on UK waters as the Government does not have the powers to implement a blanket ban. The vessels were a focus point of the new Netflix documentary, 'Seaspiracy', that shed light on much of the fishing industry's shady operations. This week, climate activist George Monbiot, and Terri Portmann, co-founder of Call for Fish, appeared on Sky News to discuss the impact the UK's fishing fleets had on the environment in the wake of Seaspiracy.

It was here that Ms Portmann - whose organisation aims to get more people eating British-sourced fish - outlined the ways in which UK fleets had tried to become sustainable despite the questionable practices of their European neighbours. She said: ""George knows well that the majority of the UK fishing fleet are small scale boats - we're talking smaller than 10 metres in length. ""These are not the type of horror pictures used in the film and nor represent some of the colourful claims that George is making. ""Actually, a lot of these coastal communities are working really hard to be sustainable. ""There's a project in Lyme Bay which is trialing vessel monitoring and has been for the last ten years, the technology is very difficult to put onto small vessels. ""But this work's ongoing - your film is 20 years too late, it represents in the UK a system and a process of fishing that was going on many years ago and for 20 years now there has been great advances in selectivity of gear, which is incredibly difficult in a mixed fishery. ""In the south-west we eat our bycatch; now admittedly it's not shark or turtles, but we should be supporting these small-scale fishermen, supporting the work they're doing to be more sustainable, to work with scientists, to find better ways of avoiding these things.""

Before this, however, Mr Monbiot was less than impressed by the efforts made so far, as he said: ""It's absolutely urgent that the small boats in particular are put on a sustainable footing. ""That means every one, all the boats, should be fitted with remote monitoring equipment so that fisheries inspectors can see what's going all the time, they're not fishing illegally, they're not fishing in the wrong places. ""We also need large, properly protected marine reserves where no fishing boats can go in, and we need to protect the small boats from the big boats, from the super trawlers which are taking so much, almost everything. ""The fishing industry is massively concentrated in the hands of a few extremely rich families.

Mr Monbiot has previously described the bloc's impact on the living world as ""catastrophic"".

In a Twitter thread last month, he wrote: ""The perverse incentives it creates have destroyed hundreds of thousands of hectares of prime habitat."" Last month, Barrie Deas, chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, said that Brussels had a ""neocolonial"" relationship with the UK on fishing.

This was, he said, because the EU had exploited UK waters for decades, offering little in return. He told Express.co.uk: ""The EU's relationship with the UK is neocolonial because it's exploitative - it's artificially attached to a trade deal. ""It gives free access to the natural resources of another country for the benefit of the colonial power.

Former Peruvian president Martín Vizcarra has been banned from holding public office for 10 years in a unanimous vote by the country’s congress after he allegedly jumped the queue to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

Vizcarra was found guilty of influence peddling, collusion and making false declarations in relation to Peru's VIP Vaccines scandal which saw scores of ministers and public officials receive Sinopharm vaccines before they were publicly available in the country. read more

Congress approved his temporary banning from public office by 86 votes in favour and zero against.

It also disqualified the former Health Minister Pilar Mazzetti from holding public office for eight years; and former Foreign Minister Elizabeth Astete for a year.

Both former ministers received the vaccine and resigned during the subsequent scandal. However, all three have denied having used their positions to obtain early access to vaccines.

Vizcarra said in February he and his wife were inoculated in October of the previous year as volunteers for the Sinopharm (1099.HK) trial in Peru - a claim the university hosting the trial denied.

The former president came to office in March 2018 on a promise to curb endemic corruption in public office and ran the country until being impeached by Congress in November last year on separate corruption charges, which he continues to deny.

He had been due to take up a seat in Congress following elections in Peru at the weekend, having obtained the highest number of votes cast for any legislator.

Sinopharm’s clinical trials in Peru took place between September and the end of 2020 with about 12,000 volunteers. In addition, local managers of the trial received 3,200 additional doses intended for personnel related to the research, host university Cayetano Heredia said.

So tomorrow, or maybe the next day, I just might decide to tweet out a video of what happened here tonight so everyone will know what the fake news is doing with all these nasty questions. Trust me, they’re going to be completely disgusted by what they watch.” At press time, Welker interrupted Trump to say that the time allotted to him had elapsed.

While Sheila does enjoy our extended line of breakfast foods, that is only one small facet of her rich and complex identity as a human being: Sheila also speaks fluent Italian, likes U2, is bisexual, and enjoys cross-country skiing. Let us make it clear that Sheila never serves the pancakes herself, but now and then goes to a diner near the courthouse where waitresses and waiters of a variety of races serve them to her.” At press time, Mars Inc. announced it would follow suit by replacing the mascot of its Uncle Ben’s brand with a black engineering graduate student.",269,1624,16,114

The Tehrik-i-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) group had given the government an April 20 deadline to expel the French ambassador over the publication of cartoons in France depicting the Prophet Mohammad. The authorities responded by arresting its leader, prompting supporters to hold protests and sit-ins across Pakistan. At least four people were killed, hundreds injured, and thousands arrested. Pakistan banned the group after the violence.

A senior police officer and two paramilitary were among the six being held by supporters of (TLP), Lahore police spokesman Arif Rana told Reuters.

""The TLP activists have two fuel tankers containing thousands of liters of petrol. They are throwing petrol bombs and stones at security officials, and also shooting bullets as the result of which 11 officials are injured,"" Rana said, adding the operation was ongoing.

TLP spokesman Shafiq Amini told Reuters four supporters had been killed on Sunday by police and several others were wounded.

Pakistani news channels have been barred from providing coverage of the group since it was banned last week read more , and on Sunday mobile and internet services were down in the area where clashes were taking place.

Roads leading to the headquarters of the group, in Lahore's Chowk Yateemkahan, have been blocked.

Still, supporters of TLP have been sharing videos on social media of what they said were clashes on Sunday with police, and hashtags supporting the group were trending in Pakistan on Sunday.

The videos, which Reuters could not independently verify, showed thousands of protesters clashing with police in riot-gear, as clouds of tear gas hung in the air and the crackle of gunfire could be heard. Other videos showed injured protesters being carried away.

On Saturday Prime Minister Imran Khan said the group had

been banned because it ""challenged the writ of the state and used street violence & attacking the public & law enforcers.""

Last week France advised its citizens to temporarily leave Pakistan for their safety. read more .

WASHINGTON—Following news that author J.K. Rowling had secretly authored the crime novel The Cuckoo’s Calling under the pen name Robert Galbraith earlier this year, multiple reports confirmed today that Rowling, widely known as the author of the popular Harry Potter series of books, is actually the longtime pseudonym of former house speaker Newt Gingrich, who created the boy wizard and penned all seven of the bestselling novels. “Assuming a fake identity really gave me a lot of freedom to build out the world of Hogwarts and flesh out the characters without drawing unwanted attention to myself or having the novels associated in any way with my political career,” Gingrich said in a statement, confirming reports he wrote the first four books in the fantasy series while still in office, but wrote the remainder before his 2012 presidential run. “I am happy readers enjoyed my books, as I myself have always felt a very strong personal connection to Harry, Dumbledore, Hermione, and all of my other characters. Honestly, I miss them all every day.” Gingrich went on to say while he mostly tried to keep his political life separate from his fiction, the character of Ron Weasley was based almost entirely on Tom Daschle.",213,1302,9,55
0,Petraeus Trashes Biden Decision to Quit Afghanistan,https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2021/04/petraeus-trashes-biden-decision-quit-afghanistan/173359/,"David Petraeus sharply criticized President Joe Biden’s decision to remove U.S. troops there, saying he worries that the “endless war” will only worsen.

“I'm really afraid that we're going to look back two years from now and regret the decision,” said Petraeus, former commanding general of U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan and former CIA director.

He spoke on a conference video call originally intended to promote a new book from retired admiral William McRaven, who oversaw the 2011 mission to find Osama bin Laden.

On the call, McRaven and other leaders of that mission, including then-CIA Director Leon Panetta, were split in their support for Biden’s decision to reposition U.S. troops to support counterterrorism missions from elsewhere in the region. But Petraeus delivered a sharper rebuke.

“I understand the frustrations very much that have led to the decision,” said Petraeus. “Nobody wants to see a war ended more than those who have actually fought it, and been privileged to command it and also write the letters of condolence home every night to America’s mothers and fathers. But I think we need to be really careful with our rhetoric, because ending U.S. involvement in an endless war doesn't end the endless war. It just ends our involvement. And I fear that this war is going to get worse.”

Petraeus said he worries the Taliban will go on the offensive, ungoverned spaces will grow, and the terrorist organizations that use them will flourish. “I don’t see how you withdraw and maintain the capabilities that one would like to have there still.”

“Frankly, we’re also going to lose that platform that Afghanistan provides for the kind of regional counterterrorism campaign,” he said. “I'm really afraid that we're going to look back two years from now and regret the decision and just wonder if whether we might not have sought to manage it with a modest, sustainable, sustained commitment that could have ensured that al Qaeda and the Islamic State would not re-establish sanctuaries from which they undoubtedly will try to figure out over time how to conduct operations that go after us, our allies, and our partners.”

McRaven said any decision incurs risks. He added that if the U.S. military is still tasked to respond to terrorism inside Afghanistan, he hopes the U.S. will retain the necessary capabilities in the country and the region.

“If you gave me the resources, I could figure out how to do this,” McRaven said, adding that he has spoken to key players close to the president about it.

“I will tell you from all my conversations with folks that are kind of in the inner circle, they have considered all of those problems,” he said. “All of the warts have been exposed to the president. He understands the risk that he’s taken.”

“Now, are we going to need some people on the ground? Yeah, we are,” he said. “We’re going to need at least some small footprint at a Bagram [Air Base]. We’re going to need a small footprint, obviously, in the capital. We’re going to need intelligence resources. I think the administration will figure out how to manage theat.”

Other Obama-era officials weighed in with support. James Clapper, former director of national intelligence, said, “I do have a lot of confidence in the growing capabilities that we have — that we didn’t have 10 or 20 years ago.”

""We are at a different level of capability"" with intelligence and have ""a lot of over-the-horizon"" capability now, said Tom Donilon, former national security advisor. Meanwhile, the Taliban is not the same problem it once was, and if it grows anew, the U.S. can handle it, he said. “The Taliban is not an international threat to the United States.” And he noted that the White House is facing new global needs and changing priorities.

Petraeus warned that the pullout would create potentially destabilizing refugee flows.

“We are going to see an exodus out of this country of anybody who has an option to leave,” he said. And of those who lack that option? “I would not, certainly, want to be part of the 50 percent of Afghans that are female.”

Expect a new Taliban offensive and more extensive safe havens for other terror groups, he said.

“They are not international extremists, but they are going to enable or allow international extremists to reestablish bases in areas that they control. They have done that already. We’ve seen that repeatedly, and supposedly right now a double-digit number of provinces actually have an al Qaeda presence in areas that are controlled by the Taliban. So I’m pretty worried about this.”

Petraeus also said he felt Biden overestimated the public’s desire to leave. “It’s an unforced error,” he said, arguing that the public cares mostly about high battlefield casualties, of which there have been none in more than a year.

Others disagreed.

""It's not just a phrase,” said Donilon. “Endless wars without specific goals in mind is not...healthy for the United States.""

“If we don’t get out now, we'll never get out,” said Jane Harman, president emerita of the Wilson Center and former ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee. She said the country hates “this endless war thing” and that Biden’s decision does play well, in part because Congress, which is supposed to speak for the people, has been absent from the conversation. “We are taking the high ground.”

Said John Brennan, former CIA director: “I do think we are going to have some challenging times ahead…but I do think that Joe Biden, at the end of the day, felt that 20 years was enough.”

In a separate event with CQ Roll Call on Wednesday, former Afghanistan War commander Stanley McChrystal said that he spent a decade in or around Afghanistan and while its security remains important to the United States, he sounded resigned to the end of the war era.

""I won't opine on President Biden's decision, and in reality I don't think we know if it's a great decision or a bad one, and we won't know for a while because I think it depends how things play out,"" he said. He said that Americans should still know that ""Afghanistan does matter"" still to the United States for many reasons, including because of China's Belt-and-Road initiative that seeks to expand Beijing's influence in the region.

McChrystal, who was fired from his command by Obama in 2010, said he keeps mounted on wall an old British musket given to him in Afghanistan, leftover from ""one of their failed efforts to control Afghanistan."" He pointed it out because, he said, ""it's possible for nations, to include our own, to have a certain amount of hubris on what we can and are willing to accomplish.""",1124,6619,7,51

0,Sketch mocking Chinese launches racism debate in Italy,https://abcnews.go.com/amp/Entertainment/wireStory/sketch-mocking-chinese-launches-racism-debate-italy-77097638,"MILAN -- A sketch on a popular Italian TV show mocking Chinese people has launched a debate about racism, and satire, in Italy.

While Asian and Black activists took to social media to share their experiences with racism growing up in Italy, including how it can be fomented by satire, the TV hosts at the center of the uproar said Thursday they have been subjected to a “wave of hatred,” including death threats.

Michelle Hunziker and Gerry Scotti, hosts of the satirical show “Striscia la Notizia” (“The News Crawls”) on the private Mediaset network, apologized for the sketch during which they made slanted-eye gestures and mimicked a Chinese accent as they introduced a segment.

“We are pained, deeply,” Hunziker told Corriere della Sera in an interview published a day after she apologized on Instagram. “We were in good faith: we are very sorry knowing that we bumped against the sensitivity of someone. But what is happening is frightening: we received a real wave of hatred that is being spread in an instrumentalized way.”

Hunziker spoke of an organized campaign against the co-hosts, that also targeted the Trussardi fashion house founded by the family of her husband, Tomaso Trussardi. “We are talking about almond-shaped eyes made by Gerry and me, when in China there are unspeakable things happening, on which we should concentrate if we want to speak of human rights.”

The producers of the show, however, refused to apologize, saying that “Striscia la Notizia” is satire, “and like satirical and comic programs all over the world, politically incorrect.”

And they struck back, citing “spurious and fascist initiatives of those who think they are blackmailing international companies and brands.”

It was the second time that the pair were skewered recently on social media, after they replayed an older sketch that used racist language to describe African children. And it comes a week after Black Lives Matter protests outside the Rome studios of RAI state television over on-air racist language and the use of blackface on one show.

The co-hosts had their defenders, who on radio shows decried what they saw as the importation of ‘cancel culture’ from the United States and the death knell of satire.

A representative of the Chinese community in Milan, Francesco Wu, said satire should be aimed at the powerful, not against minorities, especially those easily singled out.

""In this historic context, when there are many episodes of violence against the Asian community around the world, we need to be careful and not convey a message that can generate racism and discrimination,'' Wu told The Associated Press.

Wu said he made the same points in an interview with “Striscia la Notizia” in a bid to calm tensions. He emphasized that the threats against the co-hosts did not come from the Chinese community.

Black Italian activist Maddalena Fadika said shows like “Striscia la Notizia” normalize racism. “Everything is taken as satire, as a joke, stereotypes projected on minorities are taken as normal,’’ she said.

Black Lives Matter protests have grown in Italy in the last year, campaigning for looser citizenship laws for the children of foreign residents and underlining that Italy is already a multicultural society, with more than 1.2 million African-origin residents.

Chinese comprise the third-largest non-EU population in Italy, numbering some 320,000, with a strong business presence in textile-making in Tuscany and in Italy's financial capital Milan. Panic over the coronavirus in the last year has made them increasingly the target of discrimination.

An influencer who goes by the name of Momoka Banana said in a video post that she endured teasing for her Chinese appearance growing up in Rome.

“It didn’t make me feel comfortable,’’ she said. “In fact, it made me ashamed of my origins, so much that I refused for many years to learn Chinese.’’

Even now, Momoka Banana, who frequently shares stories of her life on Instagram and YouTube, said she endures people yelling on the street to make fun of the typical Chinese accent.

“People say, what do you care about the jokes, you are stronger,’’ she said. “Yes, OK, at the threshold of 30 years, I can say they are idiots, those who make fun of me. But I would not like that my nieces and nephews are made fun of at school, perhaps by classmates who saw ‘Striscia la Notizia,’ and found the joke funny.”",726,4397,8,54
0,What the Protests in Northern Ireland Could Mean for the Future of Its Peace,https://time.com/5955239/northern-ireland-protests-peace/,"In recent weeks, Molotov cocktails, bricks and bottles have met barricades and water cannons as towns and cities in Northern Ireland faced some of their worst rioting in years. Mobs made up mainly of teenagers from both loyalist and republican neighborhoods have clashed with police, who struggled to keep both sides apart at a “peace line” in Belfast.

The anger in Northern Ireland has many sources. Loyalists, who want to remain part of the U.K., want to know why, in a time of COVID restrictions, authorities pursued no prosecutions after crowds defied lockdown rules to gather for the recent funeral of a prominent member of the Irish Republican Army. A police crackdown on criminal gangs in loyalist neighborhoods has also pushed defiant young people into the streets.

But underneath all of this is the growing fear among loyalists that Brexit will increase the likelihood of Northern Ireland’s leaving the U.K. to reunify with the Irish Republic, a member of the E.U. The controversy of the moment centers on the question of borders. As part of Brexit negotiations with the E.U., U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson agreed to avoid reimposition of the land border that separates Ireland from Northern Ireland–and, therefore, the E.U. from Britain. Instead, the two sides agreed on the so-called Northern Ireland Protocol, which establishes a trade boundary in the Irish Sea.

There is still haggling to be done over the movement of food, animals and plants across that boundary to ensure that products leaving the U.K. meet E.U. legal, regulatory and health standards. There are also outstanding questions ranging from the future of steel and aluminum tariffs to the movement of pets across the border. The E.U. had argued that an alignment of standards on the manufacture of many products would mean fewer and faster border checks, but Johnson’s government is reluctant to make commitments that make it harder for the U.K. to sign future trade deals with other countries.

All of this leaves loyalists in Northern Ireland feeling pushed to the European side and fearful of a unified Ireland, while facing product shortages as new customs processes slow the movement of goods. This surge of anger comes as the governing and staunchly loyalist Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) preps for a serious electoral challenge next year. To fend off criticism that the DUP, supporters of Brexit, is responsible for Northern Ireland’s current predicament, its leaders have demanded that the protocol be scrapped entirely. If that’s not enough to blunt criticism of the party, a fragmentation of its voting bloc could leave the Northern Ireland Assembly in the hands of nationalists led by a Sinn Fein First Minister. That’s a nightmare scenario for loyalists and a serious challenge to the Good Friday Agreement, which brought peace 23 years ago.

How will Johnson respond? Many in the U.K. have moved in favor of Brexit in recent months, easing pressure on him for bold action, and Britain’s successful vaccine rollout should continue that trend. But Johnson can’t ignore Northern Ireland’s troubles, because they may become worse.

An end to the violence will require cooperation between loyalist and republican leaders, the British and Irish governments, and U.K. and E.U. negotiators charged with finding a way to ease the flow of trade to limit the risk to Ireland. Don’t expect quick progress. And there is no border fix that can ease tensions between those who hope for a unified Ireland and those who fear it.

My friends, everybody has their down days, and during these long winter months it is especially easy to succumb to the doldrums and find yourself in a bit of a funk. But not to fear! I have a simple tip that’s guaranteed to pick you up and get you back in good spirits in no time, and here it is: Whenever you’re feeling low, just remember that I, Donald Trump, will be dead in roughly 15 to 20 years.

Advertisement

That’s right. In the not-very-distant future I will die and then be gone from the world for all eternity. You may even get to watch me in a casket on national television being lowered into the ground, never to be seen again. I bet you’re smiling just thinking about that.

Now, I recognize that the news out there in the world has been particularly depressing lately, and these days it’s understandable that one might begin to feel like there’s no hope and no reason to go on, but let me assure you that there is. Oh, boy, is there ever! Indeed, you can always take solace in the fact that the monstrous, unimaginable piece of shit that is me will stop existing fairly soon, and that I will continue to not exist for the remainder of your lifetime. Biologically speaking, I, the host of NBC’s The Apprentice and Celebrity Apprentice, have no more than two decades left to live. In fact, right now I’m just 10 years away from reaching the average lifespan of an American male.

How does that make you feel? Pretty good, right?

Sure, I’ll have a grand, opulent funeral that will be talked about and broadcast extensively, and all the news segment retrospectives on my life will probably be obnoxious to watch and listen to, and will very likely make you angry. But just think: all of those segments will end with a picture of my blustery, self-important face and the dates 1946–2031 printed beneath it. Or maybe 1946–2032. Or, who knows, maybe earlier! Even if you’re not feeling glum, I guarantee the recognition that my death is a concrete and rapidly approaching inevitability will make you feel even better.

And if my death in 15 or 20 years feels like it’s too far in the future to wash away your blues, you can take heart knowing that I’ll start to physically and mentally deteriorate well before then. Why, by 2020, I, a man who recently tried to extort the sitting president of the United States to release his college and passport records, might even begin to show signs of serious and unavoidable decline in mental and physical faculties, and doesn’t that just perk your spirits right up? Just imagine me shuffling along, hunched forward, with a noticeably shortened gait and perpetually haggard face. Heck, that might happen by the end of this decade! Of course there’s an outside chance I could make it another 25 years, but in a way, wouldn’t it be even more uplifting and enjoyable for everyone if I wasted away slowly and pitifully until I became a wizened and impossibly frail old relic—the pathetically impotent, papery husk of a once-powerful man?

Hey, I’ve got an idea! Let’s try a surefire pick-me-up that is certain to buoy your spirits right this very moment: let’s think of ways I could die! Perhaps I’ll suffer through a slow, excruciating kidney failure that leaves me in profound pain that the doctors just can’t treat. It could be a massive heart attack while I’m delivering a speech to investors, forcing me to clutch my chest in agony and stagger into the audience. It could be Alzheimer’s. Or I could even be diagnosed with a vicious form of cancer that at first appears to be responding well to chemotherapy but then takes a rapid and inescapable turn for the worse.

A 3,500 year old inscription recently unearthed in Tel Lachish is the oldest piece of writing ever found in Israel and offers unprecedented insights into the development of the first alphabets, a study published in the journal Antiquity revealed on Thursday.The writing, a combination of six letters on two distinct lines, is featured on a pottery sherd found at the site, located in the Shephelah region of south-central Israel.The artifact was discovered in 2018 during excavations conducted by the Austrian Archaeological Institute at the Austrian Academy of Sciences.“Our excavation started in 2017,” said Dr. Felix Höflmayer, lead author of the paper and co-director of the excavation at Tel Lachish. “We have been looking into obtaining a radiocarbon sequence for the transition from the Middle to the Late Bronze Age.”Tel Lachish is one of the most important archaeological sites in Israel. During that period – around the middle of the 2nd millennium BCE – it was a Canaanite center.The city is also mentioned several times in the Bible.According to the Book of Joshua, the Israelites destroyed it as they conquered the Land of Israel at the end of their wanderings in the desert after the Exodus from Egypt.Lachish later became an important Israelite city in the Kingdom of Judah, until it was destroyed by the Assyrians in the 7th century BCE.The inscription was dated very precisely to 3,500 years ago, thanks to the numerous organic samples collected with it, such as seeds, which allowed the researchers to employ radiocarbon dating.“Another inscription was found in the 1930s, which some believe might go back to 100 years earlier, but because it was excavated such a long time ago, it is not possible to use radiocarbon dating,” Höflmayer explained. “Moreover, many experts have doubts regarding the alphabet script used.”The new finding is especially significant because it narrows the gap between the earliest testimonies of alphabetic script uncovered in the Sinai region and more recent evidence of Semitic alphabets.“We know that the early alphabet was invented in Sinai in approximately the 19th century BCE,” he said. “It resurfaced in southern Levant much later, only around the 13th and 12th centuries, but we had no clues about what happened between these two periods.”Before the discovery of the inscription, experts believed that writing might have been brought by Egyptians to the Levant, as archaeologists often referred to an area that includes modern Israel, Palestinian territories, parts of Lebanon, and Jordan.“In the Late Bronze Age, between 1550 and 1200 BCE, the region was under the Egyptian empire,” said Höflmayer. “The Egyptians imposed their administrative system and their own writing, and many experts thought that the early alphabet might have been introduced in this context. But now we can see that it was already in use at least by the 15th century BCE, when there was not such large-scale Egyptian domination.”Höflmayer said that even though the letters identified on the sherd bear names and compose words that might sound familiar to a modern Hebrew speaker, the alphabet was not the Hebrew alphabet, but rather an alphabet from which the Hebrew one would evolve centuries later.The inscription bears letters that the researchers identified as ayin, bet and daled, (e-v-d) forming a word that can be “eved” – which back then, as well as in modern Hebrew, means “slave.” The second word deciphered on the sherd features nun-peh-tav, (n-p-t) or “nectar.”“All alphabets have somewhat evolved from hieroglyphs, the Phoenician one, the Hebrew one, the Greek one, the Latin one and so on,” Höflmayer said. “Now we know that the alphabet was not brought to the Levant by the Egyptian rule. Although we cannot really explain yet how it happened, we can say that it was much earlier and under different social circumstances.”",669,4480,7,63

1,Bad News For Gamers: OGN Has Learned Ocarinas Are Real And They Goddamn Suck,https://ogn.theonion.com/bad-news-for-gamers-ogn-has-learned-ocarinas-are-real-1846145751,"If you were as big of a fan of Ocarina Of Time as a kid, you must have tons of fond memories of using the game’s eponymous musical instrument to solve puzzles and teleport across the kingdom of Hyrule. Frankly, it was one of the most incredible parts of leading Link on his quest to defeat the evil king Ganondorf. So, you can imagine how excited we were when we uncovered evidence that ocarinas are actually real. Yep, that’s right. These things really do exist. Now, you would think this would be a cause for celebration. However, upon further examination, we discovered something terribly unfortunate about them.

Gamers, we hate to be the bearer of bad news, but ocarinas fucking suck.

This may come as a major blow, but after doing a fair amount of research into ocarinas, we can definitely state that they’re just totally lame. They’re small and weird-looking, and for some reason, they’re always carved into stupid animal shapes. We have no idea what Nintendo was thinking by making them a centerpiece of such an important game, because as far as instruments go, you can’t do much worse than an ocarina. Even tubas are more dignified.

And it isn’t just their appearance, either. In an attempt to find a silver lining, we thought, perhaps naively so, that these stupid things might sound better than they look, but my God, were we wrong. We looked up a few videos of people playing ocarinas, and wow, it’s like listening to a fourth-grade recorder recital but somehow worse. Why anyone would want to listen to an ocarina, let alone play one, is beyond us. They’re honestly just glorified kazoos.

Our apologies if this is hard to stomach, gamers, but, trust us, we aren’t happy about it either.

Looking back on all the times the word “ocarina” evoked a powerful pang of nostalgia in us now just makes us feel like complete idiots. The worst part about all of this is that ocarinas don’t even have any actual powers. You can’t teleport with them, and playing one doesn’t actually open up any portals. They’re not at all the magical talismans we were led to believe. You basically just can blow into them and that’s it. Fucking pathetic.

Sorry to have to give you such an unpleasant reality check, but as always, readers, it is our duty as gaming journalists to keep you informed about things like this. If you’re like us, there’s no way you’ll be able to replay Ocarina Of Time now without constantly being reminded of how idiotic these things are. Fret not, though, gamers: We can always fall back on the totally badass memory from Wind Waker of conducting the breeze with a baton.

Burrow will have to spend the next four years playing for the Bengals, living in the city of Cincinnati, and carry the burden of being a hopeless franchise’s designated savior. Our only concern is that this punishment may be too harsh, but we are considering a scaled system where even worse infractions would entail being drafted by the Browns or Jets.” At press time, the N.C.A.A. had implemented a new disciple system for coaches who commit recruitment violations to be punished by up to three years as head coach of the Cowboys.",214,1270,15,97
0,Global Covid death toll nears 3m as India sees another daily record rise in cases,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/17/new-delhi-placed-under-weekend-lockdown-as-covid-wave-worsens,"The global coronavirus death toll has topped 3 million as the race for immunisation continues and countries such as India grapple with rising infections and new lockdowns.

Data released by Johns Hopkins University on Saturday showed 3,000,225 deaths and 139,963,964 cases globally.

The figures come as a new wave of the pandemic in India pushed the number of cases in the country to almost 14.5m, second only to the United States, which has reported more than 32m.

India recorded 234,692 new infections in the 24 hours to Saturday morning, according to health ministry data, the eighth record daily increase in nine days. Fatalities rose by 1,341 to reach a total of 175,649.

In Japan, rising virus cases have stoked speculation that the Olympic Games – postponed last year due to the pandemic – could be cancelled.

Japan’s prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, in his first meeting with US president Joe Biden, said his government was listening to experts and doing its “utmost” to prepare for the Tokyo games in July.

In Brazil, the country with the third-highest death toll in the world, night shifts have been added to several cemeteries as diggers work around the clock to bury the dead. Women have been advised to delay becoming pregnant because the virus variant that is devastating the South American country appears to affect expectant mothers more than earlier versions of the coronavirus.

Hopes that south Asian countries might have beaten the pandemic have been dashed with India recording more than 2m cases this month alone and Bangladesh and Pakistan imposing shutdowns.

India’s per-capita rates remain low by international comparison, raising the prospect that infection numbers – fuelled possibly by a virulent new “double mutant” – may explode further.

After a national lockdown a year ago led to hundreds of deaths and one of the worst slumps of any major economy, the Indian government has been desperate to avoid a second stoppage. However, many states areclamping down, including Maharashtra, where the biggest city is Mumbai, industry-heavy Gujarat, and Karnataka, which is home to the IT hub Bengaluru.

Uttar Pradesh state, home to about 240 million people, announced on Friday that all villages and cities would be under lockdown for one day on Sunday.

In the capital, Delhi, which has overtaken Mumbai as the worst-hit Indian city, restaurants, malls, gyms and spas were shut for the weekend. Weddings can go ahead with guests limited to 50, while a maximum of 20 people can attend funerals. Movie theatres can open with one-third capacity.

“Don’t panic. All essential services will be available through the weekend,” said the city’s chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal.

The northern state of Uttarakhand restricted gatherings to 200 people, but exempted the vast ongoing Hindu festival Kumbh Mela.

The gathering in Haridwar has attracted as many as 25 million people since January, including about 4.6 million this week alone, with most people ignoring Covid-19 guidelines. One seer died from the virus on Thursday and 80 other holy men have tested positive. Experts fear that the millions of devotees will now take the virus back to their home towns and villages.

Election rallies are also going ahead in the eastern state of West Bengal, with home minister Amit Shah attending two roadshows and one public meeting on Friday alone.

In state capital Kolkata, railway employee Samaresh Tapna fell sick after attending one such gathering and was admitted to hospital. “I felt angry with myself ... I cursed my fate,” the 42-year-old told Agence-France Presse.

Hospitals are running short of oxygen and coronavirus medicines such as Remdesivir, prompting desperate people to pay exorbitant rates on the black market.

Social media is full of horror stories of desperate calls to help a loved one needing hospital treatment for Covid-19 or other complaints. “I lost a cousin on Saturday. He was not admitted after a stroke. Tried 4 hospitals,” read one message on a Delhi neighbourhood WhatsApp group this week.

India’s drive to vaccinate its 1.3 billion people has also hit obstacles, with just 117 million shots administered so far and stocks running low, according to some local authorities.

“[It is] understandable that many people are sick of the restrictions and want to resume normal life. We must redouble our efforts to contain this disease as too many lives are at stake,”

“This is a wake-up call to the world. Vaccines must be available to everyone, everywhere, rich and poor to overcome this terrible pandemic,” said Udaya Regmi from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), calling the surge across south Asia “truly frightening”.

There was some better news in Europe, where some countries are easing their lockdowns in response to not only fatigue, but falling infection numbers and progress with vaccinations.

Italy announced on Friday it would ease coronavirus restrictions for schools and restaurants from 26 April. England eased some restrictions this week with other countries in the UK following closely behind. In the US, nearly 200 million people have been vaccinated.",830,5161,15,81

The premise of the study was simple: some 1,500 participants were shown photos and asked to count the number of people in them.

The participants were able to take suggestions from a computer algorithm or the averages of guesses from their fellow humans in order to complete the task, which involved images of 15 to 5,000 people.

Also on rt.com Professor argues that MARIO KART could inspire fairer economic system

As the crowd size or complexity of the task increased, the participants, understandably, relied more and more on the algorithm to count the people. After all, computers are especially good at tedious tasks that humans shy away from, such as counting.

“It seems like there’s a bias towards leaning more heavily on algorithms as a task gets harder and that effect is stronger than the bias towards relying on advice from other people,” says management information systems PhD student Eric Bogert, from the University of Georgia.

The researchers concede that, in this particular task at least, there is no ambiguity in terms of the answer, only right or wrong, so the lack of nuance or perspective makes the task ideal for an algorithm as opposed to a human.

“This is a task that people perceive that a computer will be good at, even though it might be more subject to bias than counting objects,” says Aaron Schecter, an information systems researcher from the University of Georgia.

However, the researchers emphasized that our perception of how accurate an algorithm can be plays an important factor – outsourcing the task to a machine unwittingly affords the opportunity for bias and discrimination to creep in unbeknownst to the human participants.

Also on rt.com New Netflix doc ‘Coded Bias’ is so keen to show AI is racist that it ignores how tech tyranny is dehumanizing EVERYONE

“One of the common problems with AI is when it is used for awarding credit or approving someone for loans,” Schecter says.

“While that is a subjective decision, there are a lot of numbers in there – like income and credit score – so people feel like this is a good job for an algorithm. But we know that dependence leads to discriminatory practices in many cases because of social factors that aren't considered.”

Algorithms already largely dictate huge portions of human activity, with the stock market, social media, and online marketplace pricing among a myriad of tasks deemed too tedious for humans, but therein lies the potential for disaster, this latest research highlights.

Clearly, we may need to reevaluate some of our ideas about the Son of God, especially now that our scholarship has revealed how Christ actively incited a crowd on the Mount of Olives to stone an adulterer to death.” Atherton went on to state that the gospel story of Jesus causing a herd of pigs to become possessed by demons and run off a cliff to their death was, however, perfectly translated.",235,1441,12,86

Article content Citing rising COVID-19 case numbers, on Friday the Province of Ontario enacted one of the strictest lockdowns yet seen in the Western world, including empowering police to stop and question any person seen outside their home. “Moving forward, police will have the authority to require any individual who is not in a place of residence to, first, provide their purpose for not being at home, and provide their home address,” said Ontario Solicitor General Sylvia Jones in a livestreamed Friday news conference. She added, “police will also have the authority to stop a vehicle to inquire about an individual’s reason for leaving their residence.” We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

The new orders effectively confine Ontario’s 14 million people to their home, save for a handful of permitted activities. “It is imperative that everyone limit their trips outside of the home to permitted purposes only, such as going to the grocery store or pharmacy, medical appointments, outdoor exercise, or for work that cannot be done remotely,” said Jones.

Article content It’s also a departure from January, when Jones’ office had specifically assured the public that police would not be stopping Ontarians simply for being outside. “On its own, being outside is not sufficient evidence of a failure to comply with the stay-at-home order,” a spokesman had said at the time. More On This Topic Ontario gives police new powers to enforce stay-home order and ban on outdoor gatherings Ontario needs aggressive vaccination drive to flatten COVID-19 curve, experts say Although the new measures would not pass Charter of Rights muster under any conventional circumstances, they are made possible thanks to wide-reaching provisions contained in the Canadian Quarantine Act. The 2005 act specifically empowers warrantless arrests, and allows peace officers to detain anyone they “believe has refused to be isolated or refuses to comply with a measure.” Accompanying the expansion of law enforcement powers was what Ontario Premier Doug Ford called the “strictest measures in all of North America.” This included a full shutdown of outdoor amenities, including golf courses, basketball courts and playgrounds. Under the prior provisions of the Reopening Ontario Act, anyone caught on a jungle gym until the lifting of the measure can face fines of $750, to an individual maximum of $100,000 and up to a year in jail.

Article content While Ontario had previously allowed outdoor gatherings of up to five people, that has now been limited to “members of one’s own household.” Jones also announced the partial closure of Ontario’s borders with the rest of Canada. Starting at midnight on Monday, roadblocks at the Manitoba and Quebec borders will now turn away any traveller who can’t prove they are travelling for work, medical care or the exercise of Indigenous treaty rights. “Should an individual not have a valid reason to enter Ontario, they will be turned back,” said Jones. Although this marks the most consequential intranational border closure since the arrival of COVID-19 to Canada, it is not without precedent. The territory of Nunavut has imposed strict restrictions on the arrival of non-residents during the pandemic. As well, the “Atlantic Bubble,” a travel-restricted area enacted by Canada’s Atlantic provinces, was enforced in part by peace officers stationed on land crossings from Quebec. The enforced stay-at-home orders are indeed the broadest COVID-19 restrictions yet observed in the Western hemisphere, although they do echo the hard lockdowns observed by New Zealand in the first weeks of the pandemic. Italy has also returned to strict lockdowns following a rise in cases and hospitalizations, and have mobilized 70,000 additional police to enforce it.

0,Navalny Team Says Russia Street Protests Set for April 21,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/04/18/navalny-team-says-russia-street-protests-set-for-april-21-a73637,"France, Germany and the European Union on Sunday joined a growing international chorus of protest at Navalny's plight, and EU foreign ministers will discuss the situation on Monday. Concerns over Navalny's health have mounted against the background of a new spike in tensions between Moscow and the West over a litany of issues, including Russia's troop build-up on Ukraine's border, interference in U.S. elections and other perceived hostile activities. Navalny's team on Sunday called for massive protests across Russia on Wednesday evening, just hours after Putin is set to deliver his state of nation address. ""It's to time to act. We are talking not just about Navalny's freedom but his life,"" Navalny's right-hand man Leonid Volkov said on Facebook.

Volkov said Wednesday's rally could become a decisive battle against ""absolute evil"" or Russia's last opposition rally for years to come. ""Call on all your acquaintances and take to central squares,"" wrote Volkov, who heads Navalny's regional offices, adding that the protests should be massive. 'Won't be allowed to die' There was no immediate reaction from the Kremlin but the Russian ambassador in London, Andrei Kelin, said Navalny ""will not be allowed to die in prison."" ""But I can say that Mr. Navalny, he behaves like a hooligan,"" Kelin told the BBC. Authorities have ramped up pressure on Navalny's supporters in recent months, detaining more than 10,000 protesters at opposition demonstrations in January and February. On Friday, Russian prosecutors asked a court to label Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation and the network of his regional offices as ""extremist"" organizations, in a move that would outlaw them in Russia and could result in jail time for their members or even supporters.

Navalny was arrested in January on returning to Russia after recovering from a near-fatal poisoning attack he says was orchestrated by the Kremlin. The Kremlin denies the allegation. The Putin critic is serving two and a half years on old embezzlement charges — which he says are politically motivated — in a penal colony in the town of Pokrov around 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Moscow. Navalny began a hunger strike on March 31 to demand proper medical treatment for back pain and numbness in his legs and hands. On Saturday, Navalny's doctors said his health had rapidly deteriorated and demanded prison officials grant them immediate access. ""Our patient can die any minute,"" cardiologist Yaroslav Ashikhmin said, pointing to Navalny's high potassium levels and saying he should be moved to intensive care.

0,‘Absolutely devastating’: how Australia’s deportation of New Zealanders is tearing families apart.,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/apr/18/absolutely-devastating-how-australias-deportation-of-new-zealanders-is-tearing-families-apart,"On an overcast day at Brisbane airport in early February, a plain white Airbus 319 with an Australian flag marking on the tail was waiting on the tarmac.

Boarding the aircraft was Taryn O’Dowd, a New Zealand citizen who had lived in Australia for 32 years.

As deportees climbed the stairs on to the plane, a Channel Nine TV crew that had been given access by former immigration minister Peter Dutton asked questions.

“How does it feel to be kicked out of Australia?” the reporter asked one of them. Then later, “Our country doesn’t want you, are you excited to go home?”, before Dutton said: “It’s taking the trash out.”

For O’Dowd, the indignity of having a bit part in the immigration minister’s political pantomime wasn’t the worst part. It was the injustice of leaving behind her 12-year-old daughter and eight-year-old son, who she will never be able to visit in Australia, that really stung.

“I don’t understand how they can take a mother away from their children,” O’Dowd says. “My crimes weren’t insignificant, but they weren’t that monumental. This is a life sentence for me.”

O’Dowd was deported after she was jailed on a drug-related matter. Amendments to visa laws in 2014 required the cancellation of the visa of anyone who has received a prison sentence of 12 months.

Before being deported, O’Dowd thought of herself as Australian above anything else.

“I got to New Zealand and I don’t sound like a New Zealander so everyone thinks I’m an Aussie,” she says. “It’s like you don’t have a place in the world any more, everything that made you who you were is gone.

He’s never going to be able to come back to see his son Christel, mother of deportee

As the drama unfolded on the Brisbane tarmac, Oliver* was sitting in a Brisbane prison. The 31-year-old New Zealand citizen was facing deportation at the end of his 12-month sentence for a drug-related charge, which meant his visa was automatically cancelled.

Oliver, who has lived in Australia since the age of six, was set to join the ranks of many others who have been deported from a country they thought was their home.

His mother, Christel, says the move would cause huge damage to Oliver and his family.

“It’s been very traumatic for my son to think about being deported to a country he hasn’t grown up in and he’s never going to be able to come back to see his son,” Christel says.

‘Things will never be the same’

Another deportee, Henry*, was one of the first New Zealanders deported from Australia after the law change in 2014. Henry had earlier served a two-year prison sentence for assault, and after serving a further 18 months in Sydney’s Villawood Detention Centre, he was deported to New Zealand in 2015, leaving behind his young daughter.

Henry had lived in Australia since he was six years old, and had no connections or family in New Zealand.

His mother, Deborah, who is now caring for Henry’s daughter, says he had turned his life around after the jail sentence and before the deportation.

“He was a role model prisoner,” Deborah says. “When he got out he was going well, he was back with his family and was so happy. They had a great life, they had a lot of potential. But then that law change smashed him to pieces.”

The deportation has devastated the lives of Deborah and her family, she says.

“Things will never be the same,” Deborah says. “We don’t really enjoy life any more. I’m not the same.”

“It’s just unbelievable that this government could do this to families, to their own neighbours. We’re not the only family ripped apart and suffering because of this.”

Difficult to fight

For those fighting deportation, it can be a long journey.

In Oliver’s case, his family successfully challenged his visa cancellation at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

He had been jailed on a drug charge that stemmed from an addiction his family says was caused by childhood trauma. He initially served four months of this sentence before being released, and then managed to turn his life around.

“He has a three-year-old son and the thought of never seeing him turned his world upside down,” Christel says. “He did everything to turn his life around.”

But midway through last year, the police decided to pursue Oliver’s case again. He decided to serve the remainder of the 12-month sentence, and return to a Brisbane prison in August last year.

That week, the government again cancelled his Australian visa.

“It’s absolutely devastating,” Christel says. “We had no idea that just by him going back to prison he would immediately have his visa cancelled again. We were so upset, we couldn’t believe it.”

This is despite Oliver’s charge being his first offence, and a non-violent, relatively minor drug-related one.

But the family had some good news this week. Thanks to a costly immigration lawyer, they have again successfully challenged the cancellation of Oliver’s visa and he can remain in Australia with his family. Christel says she is “over the moon”, but is aware that not everyone can afford to mount the same legal defence.

Policy ‘tearing families apart’

Barrister and Australian Lawyers Alliance justice spokesperson Greg Barns has represented several New Zealanders facing deportation.

“These are very, very difficult cases,” Barns says. “It’s not only the individual, but it’s also the family and their loved ones, particularly children. I’ve seen families torn apart as a result of the policy of the Australian government.

Getting rid of us hasn’t stopped the drug problem in Australia, it has just left broken families Taryn O'Dowd, deportee

“When it comes to deportation, the Australian government has no sense of humanity whatsoever. These are harrowing cases. Often people stay in immigration detention for a number of years while the case is being decided.”

New Zealanders stripped of their Australian visa do not have access to legal aid to fight this decision, and fees for immigration lawyers can typically reach hundreds of thousands of dollars, locking out most of the people facing deportation.

O’Dowd is hoping to educate the general public in Australia on what’s happening with these deportations.

“I feel like people don’t understand that we have done our time – they think we get sentenced and then get deported, they say ‘do the crime, serve the time’. But I did serve the time,” she says.

“Considering most of us have lived in Australia for so long, our crimes are more indicative of Australian culture than anything else. Getting rid of us hasn’t stopped the drug problem in Australia, it has just left broken families.”

The 2017 event drew global attention after the supposedly luxury music experience, promoted by supermodels and set to feature artists such as Major Lazer and Migos, turned out to resemble a disaster relief camp with windswept tents and decidedly non-gourmet food. Attendees had spent between $1,000 and $12,000 on tickets to the festival, which was cancelled on its opening day.

Organiser Billy McFarland apologised and said he was “committed to, and working actively to, find a way to make this right”. Numerous lawsuits were filed against him and his co-organiser, the rapper Ja Rule, and McFarland was arrested in June 2017. He pleaded guilty to numerous fraud charges relating to the festival and his company NYC VIP Access, which sold fake tickets to events such as the Met Gala. He was sentenced to six years in prison in October 2018. Ja Rule was cleared of wrongdoing a year later.

The latest lawsuit ruling, at the US bankruptcy court in New York, is still subject to a vote of approval, which will take place on 13 May, and there remains the chance that the the payout figure could be lower depending on Fyre’s bankruptcy case with other creditors.

In 2018, a judge ruled in favour of attendees Seth Crossno and Mark Thompson in another lawsuit against the festival, awarding the pair $5m in damages.",251,1486,9,60

But that simply isn’t the case here. Let’s try this: Have you ever had a pet, maybe a dog or a cat that you loved, and one day it stopped breathing and became very, very still? Maybe you had a little burial out in the yard? So this is the same thing, only it’s happened to almost 2 million people around the world, some of whom lived in your very own community. Notice we say ‘lived,’ in the past tense. That’s because these people are no longer alive. That’s what can happen, and if it does happen to someone you love, you’ll never see them again, and they’ll never see you again, and that will probably be very sad. Hopefully this clears things up a little.” The report coincides with an attempt by top economists to convince Congress to take Covid’s financial effects on the American people more seriously by explaining the concept of people.",297,1742,15,97
0,Macron says nations must 'define red lines' with Russia,https://news.yahoo.com/news/macron-says-nations-must-define-164900829.html,"Bloomberg

(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. warned Russia of “consequences” if jailed opposition leader Alexey Navalny dies, deepening the conflict over the dissident who has already survived an alleged assassination attempt and is now engaged in the third week of a hunger strike.Navalny’s supporters on Sunday called for demonstrations across Russia on April 21, to coincide with President Vladimir Putin’s state-of-the-nation address. Putin’s most outspoken critic has been imprisoned since March 11 at the notorious IK-2 prison camp about 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Moscow for breaking parole rules. He’d gone to Germany to recover from a near-fatal chemical poisoning in Siberia that he and Western governments blamed on the Kremlin. Russian authorities deny any involvement.“We have communicated to the Russian government...they will be held accountable by the international community,” U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.“We are looking at a variety of different costs that we would impose, and I’m not going to telegraph that publicly at this point. But we have communicated that there will be consequences if Mr. Navalny dies,” Sullivan said.Separately, Ned Price, spokesman for the U.S. State Department, called in a tweet for Russian authorities to immediately provide Navalny with access to “necessary medical care,” while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for the prisoner’s “immediate and unconditional release.”Navalny spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh said Saturday that he might die in a “matter of days.” His doctor, Anastasia Vasilieva, posted a copy of his blood-test results showing what she said were “critical” levels of potassium. “This signifies kidney failure, which can lead at any time to a severe disruption to his heartbeat” including the possibility of heart failure, she said on Twitter.After complaining of acute back and leg pain, Navalny began the hunger strike on March 31 to demand specialist care from doctors outside the prison system. In a post on his Instagram account Friday, Navalny’s allies reported that a prison official had warned him that a blood test indicated a “serious deterioration” in his health and that he would be force-fed if he didn’t end the protest.U.S. SanctionsPresident Joe Biden on Thursday ordered a raft of new sanctions against Russia, including restrictions on buying new sovereign debt, in response to allegations that Moscow was behind a hack on SolarWinds Corp. and interfered with last year’s U.S. election.Yet the moves were calibrated to punish the Kremlin for past behavior while keeping relations from deteriorating further, especially as tensions grow over a Russian military build-up near Ukraine. Biden has offered to meet Putin later this year, an invitation Russia said it responded to “positively.”At the same time, Navalny’s accelerating health crisis has sparked growing criticism in Western capitals.Biden was asked about Navalny’s condition on Saturday. “It’s totally, totally unfair,” he told reporters in brief remarks. Navalny’s fate is in Putin’s hands, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Sunday. The Russian opposition leader’s health is a matter of “great concern,” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told the daily Bild, adding that Berlin “urgently” demands he receive adequate medical care. The European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a statement that the 27-nation bloc was “deeply concerned” about reports of Navalny’s deteriorating state.Russia’s Federal Penitentiary Service didn’t respond to requests for comment. Officials have said previously that Navalny has received all necessary medical attention.Biden pressed Putin in a phone call on Tuesday about the poisoning of the opposition leader, which U.S. intelligence has publicly blamed on Russia’s Federal Security Service. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron also quizzed Putin about Navalny in a March 30 phone call.Asked about the Russian threat to Ukraine in an interview with CBS’s Face the Nation, Macron said that warnings of “red lines” have to be followed up with action. “It’s a failure of our collective credibility vis-à-vis Russia,” he said.Dozens of public figures including five Nobel Literature Prize winners urged Putin in an open letter Friday to ensure that Navalny immediately receives medical treatment. So far, Russia has brushed aside all Western criticism of the case and Kremlin officials refuse even to mention Navalny by name.Even as his condition deteriorates, Russian prosecutors stepped up a crackdown Friday by asking a Moscow court to declare Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation and his Moscow campaign headquarters to be extremist organizations. The opposition group warned that the designation could subject all of its staff and volunteers to criminal prosecution and imprisonment.More than 460,000 people have pledged anonymously to take part in new demonstrations calling for his release, according to a tally on Navalny’s website. Organizers on Sunday abandoned their goal of collecting half a million signatures to schedule a new protest, saying they could no longer wait, and called for the nationwide rallies instead.(Updates with Price, von der Leyen in fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",821,5453,9,55

Russia on Sunday announced the expulsion of 20 Czech diplomats a day after Prague's ""unprecedented"" decision to expel 18 Russian diplomats identified as secret agents.

The expulsions were unveiled after the Czech ambassador in Moscow, Vitezslav Pivonka, had been summoned by the Russian Foreign Ministry.

""Pivonka had been told that 20 employees of the Czech embassy in Moscow had been declared 'persona non grata',"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

""They have been ordered to leave our country by the end of April 19, 2021,"" the ministry added, calling the Czech government's decision to expel Russian diplomats a ""hostile act.""

On Saturday, Czech authorities said they would expel 18 Russian diplomats identified by local intelligence as secret agents of the Russian SVR and GRU security services that are suspected of involvement in a 2014 explosion.

Czech police also said they were seeking two Russians in connection with the blast that killed two people, and who carried passports used by suspects in the attempted poisoning of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in Britain in 2018.

Moscow alleged the move bore a ""trace"" of involvement by Washington.

""In their desire to please the United States against the background of recent U.S. sanctions against Russia, Czech authorities in this respect even outdid their masters from across the pond,"" the ministry added earlier Sunday.

The airstrikes hit caves and bunkers, which is very likely that ISIS members are holed up in, as well as the back lines in an attempt to put an end to ISIS activity in the region, amid reports of casualties.

Yesterday, SOHR sources have reported that Russian fighter jets executed intensive airstrikes since the early hours of Saturday morning, targeting ISIS caves and bunkers in Aleppo-Hama-Raqqa triangle, amid reports of casualties among ISIS members.

On Friday, SOHR activists documented over 35 Russian airstrikes since morning, which targeted ISIS positions in the Syrian desert, as the airstrikes were concentrated on Jabal Al-Bishri in southern Al-Raqqah and Hama desert.

Meanwhile, combing operations by regime forces and Russian-backed militias continued in several sectors of the Syrian desert.

On April 12, SOHR sources reported that regime forces and Russian-backed militias were deployed in areas of the Syrian desert and Aleppo-Hama-Al-Raqqah triangle, along with preparations for launching a combing operations in several areas of Al-Raqqah desert.

This development coincides with new reinforcement brought in by regime forces and the Fifth Corps in order to launch a new military campaign in the Syrian desert, specifically in the deserts of Safian and Al-Rusafa in al-Raqqa countryside, against ISIS members and cells prevalent in the region, along with a similar campaign by the same forces, backed by Russian air support, in al-Mayadeen desert since the beginning of this month.",352,2318,16,85

BEIJING, April 16 (Reuters) - China's economy grew at a record pace in the first quarter, official data showed on Friday, expanding 18.3% from a year earlier as the recovery from the coronavirus slump accelerated.

The growth in gross domestic product (GDP) was slower than the 19% forecast by economists in a Reuters poll, and followed 6.5% growth in the fourth quarter last year. It was the strongest growth since at least 1992 when official quarterly records started.

China's economy has largely recovered from last year's COVID-19 induced paralysis, fuelled by global vaccination progress, resilient exports and government stimulus.

The world's second-largest economy is expected to grow 8.6% this year, according to a Reuters poll, following a 2.3% rise last year, which was its weakest in 44 years but still made China the only major economy to avoid contraction.

However, there are doubts China can sustain the rapid pace of expansion as the low comparison base seen in the first half of last year fades.

On a quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP rose 0.6% in January-March, the National Bureau of Statistics said, compared with expectations for a 1.5% rise and a revised 3.2% gain in the previous quarter.

Russia on Sunday expelled 20 Czech diplomats in retaliation for a slew of diplomatic expulsions by Prague and gave the affected Czech diplomats just over 24 hours to leave the country, the RIA news agency quoted the foreign ministry as saying.

The Czech Republic on Saturday expelled 18 Russian diplomats, giving them 72 hours to leave, after saying that two alleged Russian spies accused of a nerve agent poisoning in Britain in 2018 were behind a deadly explosion at a Czech ammunition depot four years earlier.

The Czech Republic said it had informed NATO and European Union allies that it suspected Russia of causing the 2014 blast, and European Union foreign ministers were set to discuss the matter at their meeting on Monday.

The US State Department commended Prague’s firm response to “Russia’s subversive actions on Czech soil”.

The row is the biggest between Prague and Moscow since the end of decades of Soviet domination of eastern Europe in 1989.

It also adds to growing tensions between Russia and the West in general, raised in part by Russia’s military build-up on its Western borders and in Crimea, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014, after a surge in fighting between government and pro-Russian forces in Ukraine’s east.

A man carrying a NATO flag outside the Russian embassy in Prague [David W Cerny/Reuters] Czech police said they were seeking two Russians in connection with the 2014 blast that killed two people, and who carried passports used by suspects in the attempted poisoning of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in 2018.

Russia said Prague’s accusations were absurd as it had previously blamed the blast at Vrbetice, 300 km (210 miles) east of the capital, on the depot’s owners.

It called the expulsions “the continuation of a series of anti-Russian actions undertaken by the Czech Republic in recent years”, accusing Prague of “striving to please the United States against the backdrop of recent US sanctions against Russia”.

Earlier this week, the US announced sanctions and the expulsion of 10 Russian diplomats in retaliation for what Washington said was the Kremlin’s US election interference, a massive cyber attack and other hostile activity.

Russia responded in kind, saying it would expel 10 US diplomats and take other retaliatory moves in a tense showdown with Washington.

‘Full support’

EU and NATO partners stood by Czech officials, with British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab saying on Sunday that Britain “stands in full support of our Czech allies”.

“I resolutely condemn the subversive activities targeting the security of … our closest neighbour and ally,” Slovak Foreign Minister Ivan Korcok said in a tweet.

Protesters hold up a flag made of red underwear in front of the Russian Embassy in Prague [Michal Cizek/AFP] “Killing the citizens of the Czech Republic on its territory by another country, that’s almost an act of war,” protester Tomas Peszynski told AFP news agency at a rally outside the Russian embassy in Prague on Sunday afternoon.

About 100 protesters sported banners, saying: “We’re not Russia’s backyard”. They chanted “Shame” while waving EU and NATO flags.

The night before, police detained seven people who had smeared the embassy wall with ketchup, symbolising blood.

Czech politicians joined the outcry, with government ministers saying Russian companies should not take part in the planned construction of a new nuclear unit worth billions of euros for security reasons.

You wouldn’t be able to see what those mysterious beings from an alternate universe were doing to your penis, but that would of course be part of the thrill.” The theoretical astro-fetishists confirmed they had recently applied for a grant that would allow them to test their hypothesis by launching perverts into a black hole penis-first.

1,Report: Growing Number Of Americans Forced To Make Ends Meet By Collaborating On Song With Pitbull,https://entertainment.theonion.com/report-growing-number-of-americans-forced-to-make-ends-1819576481,"Tens of thousands of Americans say they are only able to pay their bills by shouting hooks in both Spanish and English on a Pitbull single.

MIAMI—In a further sign that the sluggish economic recovery continues to pose a challenge to the nation’s workforce, a report published Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Labor revealed that a growing number of Americans have had to resort to collaborating on songs with Cuban-American rapper Pitbull in order to make ends meet.

The paper, which attributed its findings to stagnant wages and lackluster job growth, confirmed that many poor and middle-class Americans have little choice but to pick up additional work with the chart-topping recording artist, often by contributing backing vocals, writing lyrics, producing Latin-infused beats, or repeatedly shouting the name “Pitbull” in studio sound booths as a means of providing for their families in this challenging economic climate.

“Since the stock market crash and housing sector collapse in 2008, we’ve seen a staggering increase in the number of Americans who are putting in long, demanding hours behind the mixing console with hip-hop sensation Pitbull,” said economist Jared Coan, lead author of the report. “While in decades past a single salary was enough to support a family of four, we are now finding that many breadwinners, out of financial necessity, are seeking out additional work laying down guest verses on dance-rap studio tracks like ‘Timber’ or any one of a number of its club mixes.”

“Most of these people are working a full day at their 9-to-5 jobs and then heading right into the RCA Records studio to program electronic drums for a Pitbull–Rick Ross collaboration until the early morning,” Coan continued. “Then, if they’re lucky, they have time to grab a couple hours of sleep before waking up the next day and doing it all over again.”

Faced with mounting credit card debt, surging health care costs, and in many cases pricey college tuition for their children, citizens across the country are feeling compelled to supplement their take-home pay by joining Pitbull—also known as Mr. Worldwide—on recording dates and the occasional live performance on the Planet Pit World Tour, Coan said. Specifically, survey data indicate that tens of thousands of Americans—from cashiers and food service workers, to those in formerly solid middle-class jobs, like automotive workers and insurance salespeople—have to juggle their day jobs with playing claves on a Spanish-language version of “Hotel Room Service,” spitting freestyle bars alongside guest hip-hop artists such as Flo Rida and T-Pain, and gesticulating toward the camera while filming a music video for “I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)” or “Maldito Alcohol.”

Furthermore, the report found that many single parents are having to balance their family obligations with the financial necessity of working late nights arranging diss tracks directed against Lil’ Wayne just to put food on the table, a trend that Coan called “all too typical” in the current economy.

“Over the past seven years, we’ve seen a steady decline in real median household income in the United States, which corresponds with an equally sharp rise in the number of Americans finding samples for bouncing, house-music-inspired dance hall songs, such as ‘Don’t Stop the Party’ or all the singles off the Meltdown EP,” Coan said. “And given that rent payments and food and transportation costs have only risen, it appears these individuals will simply have to continue putting in full days at one job and then immediately don white linen suits and open-collar dress shirts so they can shoot a Bud Light commercial alongside Pitbull and his entourage.”

When surveyed, most Americans confirmed they had few economic options, and stated that rapping alongside Pitbull was simply something they had to do to scrape by. However, many pointed to the unfulfilling and arduous nature of their efforts, with only a small minority of the respondents saying they receive health insurance or producer credits for their exhausting work with the Latin-American hip-hop artist.

India has recorded 10 lakh new cases in six days.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi this morning appealed in a tweet that the mega Kumbh Mela should ""now only be symbolic"". The gathering of tens of thousands of pilgrims and fears of violation of Covid protocols along the banks of Ganga has sparked nationwide concern.

Maharashtra and Delhi saw the highest-ever surge in infections in the last 24 hours. With 63,729 new infections, Maharashtra's caseload is past the 37-lakh mark now. Delhi, which has surpassed Mumbai, has recorded over 8 lakh cases since the start of the pandemic; 19,486 cases were recorded in the last 24 hours.

Grim scenes from hospitals running out of oxygen supply and crematoriums struggling to keep up have caused worry as authorities scramble to break the chain of transmission amid the fast-growing second wave.

The alarming surge in cases is being reported as states continue to report vaccine shortage. Over 12 crore doses of vaccines have been administered so far, according to the Health Ministry data. Yesterday, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, stressing that ""vaccine stocks have completely run out"".

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday held a high-level meet about the efforts being made by the government to import medical grade oxygen to bridge the demand-supply gap.

The government on Friday evening issued its third emergency order in 24 hours to ensure the uninterrupted supply of cylinders across state borders, and to allow manufacturers and suppliers to serve hospitals across India. Earlier this month, the government had insisted there's no shortage of medical oxygen.

Weekend restrictions are back in Delhi, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh among other states. Maharashtra, earlier this week, announced tough restrictions for 15 days.

1,Developmentally Disabled Burger King Employee Only Competent Worker,https://local.theonion.com/developmentally-disabled-burger-king-employee-only-comp-1819565891,"MANCHESTER, NH–Despite his third-grade reading level and IQ of 71, developmentally disabled Burger King employee Andy Ehrman is the only competent member of the 22-person Frontage Road staff.

Advertisement

""I will help you with that!"" the 28-year-old Ehrman told a drive-thru customer Monday, hustling to put the customer's order in a bag after cashier Daniel Genz dropped it on a tray and walked away. ""There you go! Thank you! Have a nice day!""

As Ehrman waved goodbye to the customer, Genz leaned against the shake machine, making a cell-phone call to his girlfriend.

""Don't forget to shut the drawer, Daniel, or someone can take all the money,"" said Ehrman, pushing the register closed and straightening the stack of trays under the counter. ""Then we'd all get in trouble!""

In addition to his usual lunch-rush duties–making sure the dining area, condiment island, and restrooms are clean and stocked–Ehrman spent 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Monday voluntarily sweeping and mopping the floor in the prep area, helping an elderly customer find her purse, and throwing salt on the icy walk outside the restaurant.

During the same two-hour stretch, 20-year-old Jenna Sanders, Ehrman's direct supervisor, incorrectly prepared three orders, spilled a jug of oil in the kitchen, and had a 25-minute conversation about the band Slipknot with coworker Debi Price.

""[Sanders] double-charged me for a BK Big Fish Value Meal,"" customer Terry Unger said. ""Then she got my order completely wrong. I was about to storm out of there and never come back again when this retarded kid, all smiles, comes up and asks if I need help. Sixty seconds later, he hands me the correct order and change, and apologizes for the trouble. Finally, someone who understands how to treat a customer.""

Unger added that in addition to having the only clean uniform in the store, Ehrman seemed to be the sole employee with basic interpersonal skills.

""Maybe they teach it in the special-ed classes or something, but he's the only one who actually speaks in sentences as opposed to grunts,"" Unger said. ""And when I asked for extra ketchup packets, he handed them to me and said, 'Here you go,' instead of rolling his eyes.""

Ehrman is also willing to perform tasks beyond those in his job description, offering to help coworkers stock shelves or run the dishwasher when they fall behind. Most nights, Ehrman even volunteers to clean the grease traps.

""I don't mind,"" Ehrman said. ""I'm helping!""

Willis Barnett, a delivery driver who makes twice-weekly dropoffs at the Frontage Road store, is among the many people impressed with Ehrman.

Employee Randy Leyner (left) sits while Ehrman clears a table.

""I love it when I make a delivery and they've got that tard working in the back,"" Barnett said. ""He always knows exactly where everything goes. Everyone else just says, 'Uh, I don't know–toss it on the floor or something.'""

Among his many other qualities, Ehrman boasts a near-encyclopedic knowledge of Burger King protocol and safety regulations.

""[Assistant manager] Kerri [Sheckley] said the dishwasher uses the green stuff, and [manager] Bob [Hundhausen] said it uses the purple stuff,"" Ehrman said. ""But then I saw on the TV show [training video Cleaning The Burger King Way] that you use both, 'cause one is the stuff that kills germs and one is soap. So I use both.""

Advertisement

Ehrman also makes an effort to bring potential safety hazards to coworkers' attention.

""Hey, Randy, we can't put cardboard boxes or anything paper under there,"" Ehrman told Randy Leyner, 26, upon seeing him put a stack of french-fry cartons under the fryer. ""It could start a fire!"" After being ignored by Leyner, Ehrman dragged the cartons to the rear storage closet himself.

Unlike other members of the Frontage Road team, Ehrman never shows up late or asks to leave early. In fact, when Ehrman works the morning shift, he can usually be seen waiting in the front lobby by 5:30 a.m., 45 minutes before the morning manager arrives to unlock the door.

But despite working substantially harder than any of his coworkers, Ehrman bears no resentment toward them.

""I used to work at the hospital in the mailroom, but it was boring and people were mean to me,"" said Ehrman, plugging his nose and shaking his head to signify that the job ""stank."" ""I like to work at Burger King better. There's always lots and lots to do. And I get a free Whopper to take home!""

Miriam Donnelly, the social worker who placed Ehrman at Burger King, is extremely pleased with his success.

""Andy has trouble with basic addition and spelling his name, but he fits right in at Burger King,"" Donnelly said. ""The work seems almost tailor-made for someone with special needs.""

Donnelly added that everything at Burger King, from the touch-pad registers to the step-by-step diagrams for folding the apple-pie sleeves, is designed to help low-functioning individuals succeed.

""Andy may go a little slower than some of the other workers, but he does one thing at a time, focuses on it, and, in the end, gets it right,"" Donnelly said. ""Actually, now that I think about it, he's not really any slower.""",869,5255,8,67

“This should alarm us all,” Lowcock said in his briefing, obtained by The Associated Press. “It is a sign of what lies ahead if more action is not taken. Starvation as a weapon of war is a violation.”

No one knows how many thousands of civilians or combatants have been killed since months of political tensions between Ethiopian President Abiy Ahmed’s government and the Tigray leaders who once dominated Ethiopia’s government exploded in November into war. Eritrea, a longtime Tigray enemy, teamed up with neighboring Ethiopia in the conflict.

Lowcock said humanitarian organizations had hoped things would improve after Abiy announced in late March that Eritrean troops would leave Tigray, but he said neither the U.N. nor the aid groups it works with have seen any proof of withdrawal.

Story continues below advertisement

“We have, however, heard some reports of Eritrean soldiers now wearing Ethiopian Defense Force uniforms,” he said. “And regardless of uniform or insignia, humanitarian staff continue to report new atrocities which they say are being committed by Eritrean Defense Forces.”

As an example, Lowcock cited an Amnesty International report that Eritrean troops killed three people and wounded 19 Monday “in an unprovoked, indiscriminate shooting attack on civilians in Adwa town.”

There are also reports of militias from neighboring Amhara attacking civilians in western Tigray and driving them from their home while Amhara authorities restrict access to those who fled, he said.

As for reports of sexual violence, Lowcock said one unnamed agency reported that 30% of all incidents against civilians involved some sort of sexual violence and nearly 25% of reports received by another involved gang rape, “with multiple men assaulting the victim,” sometimes repeatedly over a period of days, and with girls as young as 8 years old being targeted.

“Cases reported have involved Ethiopian National Defense Forces, Eritrean Defense Forces, Amhara Special Forces and other irregular armed groups or aligned militia,” he said.

Lowcock said he is left to conclude “that there is no doubt that sexual violence is being used in this conflict as a weapon of war, as a means to humiliate, terrorize and traumatize an entire population today and into the next generation.”

Story continues below advertisement

He said humanitarian needs are still growing because “since the conflict began, civilians have endured indiscriminate shelling of towns, targeted violence, mass killings and executions and systematic sexual violence as a weapon of war.”

“Improvements in access and a reduction in conflict and atrocities have often proved temporary and sporadic,” Lowcock said. “So they are getting hungrier and sicker.”

“To be very clear: The conflict is not over and things are not improving,” he said.

Without a cease-fire, Lowcock said, the humanitarian crisis “is only going to get a lot worse.”

Despite these difficulties, humanitarian organizations have reached more than 1.7 million people with some form of aid, but he said more funding is needed.

Lowcock said agencies have allocated about $280 million of what the U.N. thinks will be more than $400 million needed to respond to Tigray’s humanitarian crisis, and he thanked the United States for announcing about $300 million for the region.

As Covid-19 cases in India continue to rise steadily, Serum Institute of India (SII) CEO Adar Poonawalla on Friday appealed to US President Joe Biden to lift the embargo on export of raw materials needed to manufacture vaccines out of the United States so that vaccine production can be fast-tracked.

Tagging Biden on Twitter, Poonawalla wrote, “Respected @POTUS, if we are to truly unite in beating this virus, on behalf of the vaccine industry outside the U.S., I humbly request you to lift the embargo of raw material exports out of the U.S. so that vaccine production can ramp up. Your administration has the details.”

Your administration has the details. 🙏🙏 — Adar Poonawalla (@adarpoonawalla) April 16, 2021

Vaccines are running out of stock in a number of states who have already raised the issue with the Centre.

In an interview to NDTV tweeted by the channel earlier this month, Poonawalla had said SII, that is manufacturing Covishield, would require around Rs 3,000 crore to ramp up its Covid-19 vaccine production capacity. “We need roughly Rs 3,000 crores which is not a small figure considering we have already spent thousands of crores. We have to find other innovative ways to build our capacity so we can support our nation in light of Covid surge,” he said, adding that the vaccine industry has sacrificed millions of dollars to support the nation.

The company currently has the capacity to produce 60 to 70 million doses per month, he said.

At present, India is immunising frontline workers, people with co-morbidities and all others above 45 years of age with either of two vaccines — SII’s Covishield and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. Apart from this, clinical trials of SII’s Covovax have also begun and the company plans to launch it by September this year.",372,2206,22,162
0,Five people killed as police fire at protesting workers in Bangladesh,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/17/five-people-killed-as-police-fire-at-protesting-workers-in-bangladesh,"At least five people were killed and dozens injured in Bangladesh after police opened fire on a crowd of workers protesting to demand unpaid wages and a pay rise at a Chinese-backed power plant, officials and police said.

Police opened fire after about 2,000 of the protesters began hurling bricks and stones at officers at the construction site of the coal-fired plant in the south-eastern city of Chittagong, local police official Azizul Islam told Reuters.

Four protesters died at the scene and another died in hospital, he said.

“We’re trying to control the situation,” Islam said, adding that at least six police officers were among those injured.

The workers attacked and set fire to several structures at the 1,320-megawatt power plant, located 265 km (165 miles) south-east of the capital, Dhaka, he added.

Local government official Saiduzzaman Chowdhury said the workers were protesting over unpaid wages and to press demands for a pay rise and reduced hours during the holy month of Ramadan, which started this week, when Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset.

Several of the injured workers had gunshot wounds and were taken to a hospital in Chittagong, he said, adding that the five people who were killed had all been shot.

The $2.4bn power plant is a major source of foreign investment into Bangladesh, and one of a series of projects that Beijing is pushing to cultivate closer ties with Dhaka.

In 2016, China’s SEPCOIII Electric Power Construction signed a deal with S Alam group, a Bangladeshi conglomerate responsible for construction work at the site.

During that year, four protesters opposed to its construction were killed when police opened fire during clashes between villagers who were demonstrating both for and against the project.",286,1765,11,69

Biden’s second round of sanctions aimed at Russian President Vladimir Putin are tougher and more sweeping than the last. Russia is accused of hacking the networks of at least nine federal agencies five months ago to gather U.S. secrets in the SolarWinds cyberbreach.

Russia also allegedly tried to influence the 2020 presidential election by waging disinformation campaigns to help the candidacy of Donald Trump, mirroring meddling efforts in the 2016 election.

For the first time, the Biden administration publicly identified the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, also known as APT 29, Cozy Bear and The Dukes, as the perpetrator of the SolarWinds attack, which the United States said gave Russia the ability to infect or potentially spy on 16,000 computer systems worldwide. Russia is accused of infecting software with malicious code to execute the broad-scope cyber espionage campaign.

The Biden administration sanctioned six Russian technology companies that provide support to Russia’s cyberprogram in addition to 32 entities and individuals accused of carrying out Russian government-directed attempts to influence the election. The United States joined with the European Union and other allies to sanction eight other individuals and entities associated with Russia’s occupation in Crimea.

The 10 diplomats expelled from the Russian Embassy in Washington include representatives of intelligence services, the White House said.

Targeting Russia's financial sector, the U.S. Treasury Department directed U.S. financial institutions to not participate in the primary market for ruble or non-ruble denominated bonds issued after June 14 by Russian banking institutions. The action gives the U.S. government authority to expand sovereign debt sanctions on Russia.

In brief remarks from the White House, Biden said he told Putin in a phone call Tuesday that ""we could have gone further, but I chose not to do so. I chose to be proportionate.""

""The United States is not looking to kick off a cycle of escalation and conflict with Russia. We want a stable, predictable relationship. If Russia continues to interfere with our democracy, I'm prepared to take further actions to respond.""

Biden added that there are areas where the U.S. and Russia ""can and should work together,"" pointing to arms control and the recent five-year extension of the New START Treaty limiting nuclear arsenals of the two nations.

A senior Biden administration official, who spoke about the actions on the condition of anonymity, said other responses against Russia will “remain unseen” in the public eye.

The White House singled out reports that Russia encouraged Taliban attacks against U.S. troops in Afghanistan but said the new actions aren’t tied to the alleged bounties because of “low-to-moderate confidence” in the intelligence. The White House said the response to the alleged bounties are “being handled through diplomatic, military and intelligence channels.”

In March, the Biden administration sanctioned Russia over the poisoning and detention of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.

Additional sanctions against Russia had been telegraphed by the Biden administration for weeks.

Tuesday, in his second phone call with Putin as president, Biden previewed the actions, telling him that the United States “will act firmly in defense of its national interest” in response to cyber intrusion and election interference. He called for Putin to “de-escalate tensions” after Russia’s military buildup in Crimea and on Ukraine’s borders. Biden proposed a summit meeting in a third country this summer with Putin to discuss U.S.-Russian relations.

""Our teams are discussing that possibility right now,"" Biden said. ""And out of that summit – were it to occur and I believe it will – the United States and Russia could launch a strategic stability dialogue.""

The new actions are certain to further heighten tensions building between Putin and Biden after the Russian leader enjoyed a warmer relationship with Trump.

In a television interview last month, Biden said Putin would ""pay a price"" for Moscow's interference in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Biden was asked whether he thought Putin is a killer. ""I do,"" the president responded. In response, Russia recalled its ambassador to the United States, and Putin pointed at the U.S. history of slavery and slaughtering Native Americans and the atomic bombing of Japan in World War II.

""My bottom line is this,"" Biden said. ""When there is interest to work with Russia, we should and we will. And when Russia seeks to violate the interests of the United States, we will respond.""

Asked whether Putin gave any indication he will change his behavior, Biden said, ""My hope and my expectation is we will be able to work out a modus vivendi.""

In response to the Navalny poisoning, the Biden administration sanctioned seven senior members of the Russian government last month. The United States added 14 entities to the Department of Commerce's blacklist, mirroring sanctions imposed by the European Union and the United Kingdom over the attempted murder of Navalny. The sanctions prevent top figures allied with Putin from accessing financial and property assets in the USA.

Previous administrations' actions have failed to change Moscow’s behavior, including Russian hacking. After Russian meddling in the 2016 election, the Obama administration expelled diplomats from the USA. Though Trump was often reluctant to criticize Putin, his administration expelled diplomats in 2018 for Russia's alleged poisoning of an ex-intelligence officer in Britain.

""We can't predict what the impact will be,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. ""But we still believe when there is unacceptable behavior, we should put consequences in place.""

U.S. officials are still grappling with the aftereffects of the SolarWinds intrusion, which affected agencies including the Treasury, Justice, Energy and Homeland Security Departments, and assessing what information may have been stolen. The breach exposed weaknesses in the federal government's cyberdefenses.

Unlike those pussies at Cinnabon, Claire’s, or Spencer Gifts, we refuse to stay silent and will show no mercy to criminals making off with a pump dispenser of our signature cheese dip. Should these vandals steal so much as a teaspoon of our irresistible cinnamon-and-sugar-dusted pretzel dough, they will pay the ultimate price.” At press time, the company had released an additional statement to announce the rollout of its new “Blueberry Lives Matter” Sweet Pretzel.

0,Chinese Scientists Create New Mutant Bird-Flu Virus,https://www.wired.com/2013/05/h5n1-h1n1-reassortment/,"In nature, some strains of the influenza virus are highly lethal while others jump easily from person to person. What public health officials fear most is a hybrid that combines the lethality of one with the transmissibility of the other, creating a deadly global pandemic.

Now a team of Chinese scientists has investigated that in their lab by creating a new hybrid virus. They combined H5N1 avian influenza, which is highly lethal but doesn't transmit easily between people, with the highly contagious H1N1 swine flu strain responsible for infecting tens of millions of people in 2009.

The new hybrid virus passed easily between guinea pigs, which are used to study how flu infects mammals. Molecular changes in the virus may provide clues of what to look for in circulating H5N1 strains, perhaps allowing scientists to anticipate when viruses will more easily infect humans.

""Mammalian-transmissible H5N1 viruses can be generated in nature,"" said virologist Chen Hualan at China's Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, who led the research team. ""High attention should be paid during routine influenza surveillance to monitor such high risk H5N1 hybrid viruses in nature.""

The experiments, described May 2 in Science, reflect a controversial approach to studying influenza: attempting to create strains in a lab that would, if accidentally released or used for nefarious purposes, pose a potentially global health threat.

Some scientists think the risks don't outweigh the benefits, and that institutional safeguards don't sufficiently reduce chances of accidents. Public unease with such experiments resulted in a year-long moratorium on the research.

According to microbiologist Richard Ebright of Rutgers University, a prominent critic of the work, the new study shows little that wasn't revealed by an H5N1 experiment published in March by one of the research teams that originally sparked the controversy.

That study, led by virologist Ron Fouchier of Erasmus University in the Netherlands, also showed how H5N1 could become more transmissible in mammals.

""The sole major difference is the use of guinea pigs in this paper and ferrets in that paper,"" said Ebright. ""In my assessment, neither paper contains substantive new information that justifies the risks posed by the research.""

Hualan's next research focus is to study the array of genetic changes that allowed his H5N1 strains to infect guinea pigs, perhaps understanding the specific molecular and physiological mechanisms that help particles of flu virus latch onto respiratory cells.

That might give researchers clues about how to interfere with that process, or at least a heads-up on what type of changes to look for in flu strains evolving now in the wild.

""The important thing is that insights from such studies will benefit disease control and prevention,"" Hualan said. Both she and Ebright agreed, however, that mutations seen in the laboratory may be different from the evolutionary paths taken by influenza in the wild.

British health officials are investigating a COVID-19 variant originating in India but as yet they do not have enough evidence to classify it is as a variant of concern, Susan Hopkins of Public Health England (PHE) said on Sunday.

Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show on BBC television, Hopkins said: ""We have not got enough data about this variant yet to be able to clarify whether it's a variant of concern. We have put it as a variant under investigation.""

""To escalate it up the ranking we need to know that it's increased transmissibility, increased severity, or vaccine-evading, and we just don't have that yet, but we're looking at the data on a daily basis.""

PHE has said it has identified 77 cases of the variant in Britain.

Earlier, environment minister George Eustice said Prime Minister Boris Johnson's trip to India later this month should go ahead despite rising cases in the country.

""It is important that business and the business of politics if you like does continue,"" he said, adding that an expert committee periodically reviews decisions about whether to permit travel to certain countries.

0,Peru establishes 2.7 million acre rainforest reserve for isolated Indigenous peoples,https://news.mongabay.com/2021/04/peru-to-establish-rainforest-reserve-for-isolated-indigenous-peoples/,"After nearly twenty years of discussion, the Peruvian government has moved to establish a new Indigenous reserve for “uncontacted peoples” deep in the Amazon rainforest.

Yavarí Tapiche Indigenous Reserve, which covers 1.1 million hectares (2.7 million acres) in the department of Loreto on the Peru-Brazil border, is home to Matsés, Remo, and Marubo peoples, as well as other groups that have yet to be identified.

Yavarí Tapiche will be established under Peru’s law governing territories for peoples in isolation and initial contact (PIACI).

Yavarí Tapiche has been officially categorized as the first PIACI reserve in Loreto, but its protection plan still must be approved by the Ministry of Culture within 60 days.

After nearly twenty years of discussion, the Peruvian government has moved to establish a new Indigenous reserve for “uncontacted peoples” deep in the Amazon rainforest. Yavarí Tapiche Indigenous Reserve, which covers 1.1 million hectares (2.7 million acres) in the department of Loreto on the Peru-Brazil border, is home to Matsés, Remo, and Marubo peoples, as well as other groups that have yet to be identified.

Yavarí Tapiche will be established under Peru’s law governing territories for peoples in isolation and initial contact (PIACI). These peoples, sometimes popularly known as “uncontacted tribes”, have little or no contact with the outside world and live in some of the world’s most biologically diverse landscapes, including remote parts of the Amazon Basin.

Under its PIACI law, Peru has defined ten territories for isolated peoples, of which four — including Yavarí Tapiche — have been categorized as an Indigenous reserve by the state. Two others were categorized as territorial reserves before the Piaci Law was approved and must be adapted, while four others are still waiting for the formal creation process to advance.

Yavarí Tapiche has been officially categorized as the first PIACI reserve in Loreto, but its protection plan still must be approved by the Ministry of Culture within 60 days. This process involves resolving overlapping extractive concessions within the reserve, which means deadlines could slip according to Angela Arriola, a specialist in policies for Indigenous peoples and Piaci and external advisor to the Inter-ethnic Association for the Development of the Peruvian Jungle (Aidesep)

“The creation of Yavarí Tapiche is a great advance. However, the rest of the tools must be implemented as soon as possible to ensure their protection,” said Arriola. “It is a great step, a great advance, but management measures need to be implemented, only categorization is not a guarantee of protection.”

One challenge is protecting Indigenous peoples in Yavarí Tapiche from an array of threats, including drug traffickers, and illegal loggers who operate in the area. For that reason, the Ministry of Culture says it will implement early warning mechanisms and checkpoints.

Additional complication is the reserve overlaps with Sierra del Divisor National Park and the Matsés National Reserve, but Arriola says that shouldn’t be a significant obstacle since the proposed protection strategy for Yavarí Tapiche is consistent.

The history of the Indigenous reserves

The history of the creation of Yavarí Tapiche sheds light on the drawn-out nature of establishing Indigenous reserves in Peru.

Since the application for Yavarí Tapiche was submitted in 2004, there have been many delays and postponements, said Beatriz Huertas, an anthropologist at Aidesep. The first was the enactment of the PIACI law in 2006, which established new processes and conditions to set up reserves for isolated peoples. That law however wasn’t enacted until 2011 and the commission established to evaluate the applications didn’t start until a year later. Then there were objections from companies operating in the area.

“In 2013, Yavarí Tapiche obtained a favorable rating from the state, but received opposition from oil companies operating in that territory and there was a setback. They had to press hard for the Ministry of Culture to move forward,” said Huertas, adding that it was only in 2015 that the necessary studies were carried out to establish the reserve. “Orpio [Regional Organization of Indigenous Peoples of the East] presented solid evidence of the presence of Indigenous peoples in isolation.”

In March 2018, the supreme decree that recognized PIACI’s presence in this territory was issued. And three years later the categorization process was finished. The process took 17 years.

The Ministry of Culture says Yavarí Tapiche is the first to be established after the approval of the PIACI Law.

“It constitutes a historic milestone in the protection of the rights of Indigenous peoples in a situation of isolation and initial contact,” the ministry said in a statement sent to Mongabay Latam.

The ministry said the establishment process is continuing for other proposed and pending reserves for isolated peoples. But for efforts to secure the territory of Indigenous peoples in isolation in Yavarí Tapiche, the two decade wait is almost over.",794,5101,11,84

Oh yes, we do. What is it, you may be wondering? Well, get ready, because it’s going to knock your socks off: After pulling some strings, we are pleased to announce that the common loon Gavia immer is now officially the gaming bird!

Yep, that’s right. Thanks to our connections, the bird known as the Great Northern Diver has now been sanctioned as the avian ambassador for PC and console users alike.

You’re welcome, readers. Don’t say we’ve never done anything for you.

How did we do it, you ask? How did we manage to get the monogamous, crustacean-eating Nearctic waterfowl appointed as the official gaming bird? Well, having spent decades as the i nternet’s premiere website for video game journalism, we’ve made some friends in high places. Let’s just say we reached out to our people at the Audubon Society, called in a few favors from some old business associates at the World Wildlife Fund for Nature, and, well, we managed to work something out.

That’s not important, though. What is important is that the common loon, with its vibrant plumage and highly adept fishing skills, is now a certified symbol for gamers around the world, from JRPG fans to Battle Royale esports champions and everyone in between, and you have us to thank for it.

We could’ve settled for the yellow-rumped warbler or the northern cardinal, but no. We wanted only the best for you, gamers. Sure, we may have had to grease some palms and scratch some backs, but don’t go worrying your pretty little heads about all of that. We have our ins, and we’ll use them for you. We live to serve our friends, after all.

Now, every time you hear the magnificent tremolo call of the common loon or see one building a nest out of dead marsh grass, you can feel comfortable knowing that this creature, in all its glory, represents gamers like you.

Okay, look, to be totally honest, gamers, there’s a little bit more about this deal that we haven’t let you in on. Apparently, one of the loans we took out to pay off a WWF officials was linked to the Kurdish m afia. Who knew, right? Anyway, we may have pissed off some of the wrong people while working out this deal and we may need to lam it for a bit in Peru. But still, we’d be lying if we said it wasn’t worth getting in over our heads a bit in exchange for securing such a magnificent specimen as the official gaming bird.

Maj. Gen. Edgard Arevalo, Armed Forces of the Philippines spokesperson and Balikatan director, said that except for one drill, most of this year’s activities would be limited to interoperability tabletop exercises and expertise exchanges.

The only “kinetic” drill set for the 36th Balikatan exercises will be the simulated close air support or Simcas and live fire event to be held on April 20 at the Colonel Ernesto Rabina Air Base in Pampanga. It will not require face-to-face interaction among participants.

“It will simulate the need to employ air capability while observing the procedures involved during call for fire,” Arevalo said.

“What we’re training for is the respective roles of the US Armed Forces and the AFP in responding if the Mutual Defense Treaty is triggered or activated,” he added.

Until April 23

At the same time, there will also be subject matter exchanges pertaining to air and maritime interdiction, as well as COVID-19 pandemic response.

The exercise scenario will likewise involve the dispatch of aircraft from the American base in Okinawa, Japan, in response to a call from ground forces for fire support.

This year’s exercises will run until April 23. There was no Balikatan in 2020 due to the pandemic.

In a message to reporters, Arevalo said, “The intent of every iteration of Balikatan [was] for both armed forces to train together on defense and security leveraging on the capability, experience and strength of their friendship.”

According to him, “Balikatan is done annually to ensure interoperability in terms of command, control, computers, communications, intelligence, surveillance reconnaissance, and subject matter expert exchanges.”

Wealden MP Nusrat Ghani described “groups of Uighurs being sold like slaves for auction” as “horrific” and “utterly grotesque”.

Reacting to the report on Sky News, former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith said that there’s “no question” in his mind that the Chinese authorities are engaged in genocide.

“The truth is that the Chinese authorities are engaged in – absolutely no question now, in my mind – in genocide,” he said. “They’re trying to eradicate an ethnic group.”

The report, produced by Sky News correspondent Tom Cheshire, says that there are dozens of adverts on websites hosted by Baidu advertising Uighur labourers in batches of 50 to 100 workers.

One agent who posted such an advert reportedly told Sky News that workers from Xinjiang are subject to a “political examination” by the local government of their receiving province and that they are placed under “half-military management” while working.

The Xinjiang government says in its 2019 five-year plan that its “labour transfer programme”, which Baidu allegedly facilitates, is aimed at providing “more employment opportunities for the surplus rural labour force”.

It has described claims from human rights groups that Uighur Muslims are actually subject to forced labour as “the lie of the century”.

China’s government has also described allegations that it is carrying out a genocide of Uighur Muslims at “re-education camps” in Xinjiang as “ridiculously absurd” and a “complete lie”.

A report released by the Washing DC-based Newlines Institute for Strategy think tank concluded last month that China’s government “bears responsibility for committing genocide” and that it has violated every provision of the United Nation’s Genocide Convention in its actions towards the Uighurs in Xinjiang.

The House of Commons will debate the “mass human rights abuses and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region” on 22 April, in a motion led by Ms Ghani.

The debate may be followed by a non-binding vote on whether to declare China responsible for genocide. Such a vote could further strain diplomatic ties between the UK and China, a key trading partner.

Speaking to Sky News, Mr Duncan Smith cast doubt that the British government will be willing to condemn China.

“The government refuses to say that this is genocide because they say that only a competent court can do so,” he said. “But the problem we’ve got is, the only competent court that can call a genocide a genocide concerning a national purpose are actually either the International Criminal Court or the International Court of Justice.

“China’s not a signatory to the Criminal Court and the Court of Justice gets blocked at the UN in the Security Council, of which they are a member.”

In response to Sky News’s report and Mr Duncan-Smith’s comments, a Foreign Office spokesperson toldThe Independent: “The evidence of widespread human rights violations in Xinjiang cannot be ignored – including mass detention and invasive surveillance and reports of torture and forced labour.

“The UK has taken robust action in response, including targeted sanctions against those responsible as well as introducing measures to help ensure UK organisations are not complicit in these violations.

“The international community will not look the other way and will hold the Chinese authorities to account for their actions.”",645,4173,12,80

We’re talking Red, Yellow, Blue, Purple, White, Rock and Flying Pikmin, sliced up and ready for your enjoyment! So drop whatever you’re doing and come on by the Nintendo Gaming Experience to get an absolutely free, no-questions-asked sample. And if you’re worried about trying such an exotic cut of meat, don’t worry! These are flame-grilled, beautifully seasoned, and butchered into perfectly bite-sized cubes, so you won’t even imagine a Pikmin’s cute little face while you’re chowing down.

Admittedly, there’s a certain crunch to the Pikmin meat that might be a bit unnerving if this is your first time. That’s from their tiny bones and inner tendons, which aren’t removed in most traditional preparations. After you understand that, you’ll realize those crunchier and chewier components actually lend a nice textural component. And the meat’s flavor? It has this sweet and savory mix that you’ve got to experience for yourself to believe.

If you want to get really adventurous, there are also a few Bulbmin samples, too. But watch out! One out of every hundred preparations is supposed to be poisonous.

As an added incentive, the Nintendo employees are also providing wine pairings for the first 50 attendees. That really helps wash down the gamier taste of these half-plant, half-animal bites. They’re also offering complimentary silk cloth s to cover your face if you want to avoid offending G od with this culinary trespass against the laws of nature. Just remember, they’re flying off the sample tray, so get on over here for your own bite of these little critters as soon as you can!",345,2046,24,122

The controversial public cash 'passport' proposal is contained within Executive Office reports relating to the Communities in Transition (CIT) scheme.

It states that convicted terrorists should be ""eligible"" to ask the PSNI for an endorsement, and that should then allow them to work with community organisations including those in ""receipt of public money"".

The demand has caused further concerns among politicians already reeling from the news that paramilitary-supported groups are to be handed £10m of public cash.

One senior source told this newspaper: ""This is effectively paramilitaries asking for a police-endorsed 'passport' to allow them to access taxpayers' money. It's a ridiculous suggestion to expect the PSNI to get involved in this.""

Sunday Life revealed last weekend how First Minister Arlene Foster and deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill have allocated a further £10m of public cash to phase two of the CIT project, having already thrown £12m at phase one.

Whatsapp CASH INCENTIVE: Arlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill have signed off a further £10m to the controversial CIT fund for paramilitaries

The spend has been branded ""incredible"" by politicians as the budget allocation was confirmed in the same week of the worst sectarian rioting seen in Northern Ireland in a decade - violence which several loyalist leaders encouraged.

CIT's core objective is to help paramilitaries 'transition' into community roles, and the project involves several ex-UVF and IRA prisoners.

To aid this 'transition' loyalists and republicans have asked for restrictions not to be placed on them accessing public cash if they are given PSNI references.

This 'possible solution', contained within Executive Office reports, states: ""Any person convicted of a scheduled offence in connection with the affairs of Northern Ireland should be eligible to ask the PSNI for formal confirmation that they have no current involvement with criminal activity, or issues of a security concern for three years or more.

""Formal confirmation should allow them to participate without hindrance in the affairs of any community organisation on the basis of full and equal membership, including employment. This includes the receipt of public money by organisations in which they are employed. It is important to provide support for those who want to transition.""

But the demand has only caused further rows between politicians concerned at which groups will benefit.

Executive Office sources explained how Sunday Life's recent revelations about the £22m CIT fund caused ""mayhem"" within the corridors of power at Stormont.

Hastily arranged meetings last Monday and Tuesday discussed the fallout from our story, and the public perception that government is again throwing millions of pounds at paramilitaries in the hope that they go away.

An insider said: ""Senior people at Stormont are finally coming round to the realisation that the public is not going to tolerate any more money being handed over to convicted paramilitaries or their pet projects.""

MLAs have tabled several urgent questions to the Executive Office on the matter, with People Before Profit's Gerry Carroll asking how many organisations are benefiting from the CIT fund and what criteria they were asked to meet for funding. SDLP Assembly members Colin McGrath and Matthew O'Toole have also filed questions about the multi-million pound scheme.

The big winners from the CIT programme appear to be the republican and loyalist restorative justice groups Community Restorative Justice (CRJ) Ireland and Alternatives NI.

The registered charities, which raked in a combined £1.8m of public money last year, were set up by former IRA and UVF prisoners as a way to deal with neighbourhood disputes without involving the courts.

Both are being funded to roll out restorative justice projects in the eight areas of Northern Ireland which will benefit from the £10m of phase two CIT cash.

Several of these districts - west Belfast, north Belfast, the Shankill and Carrickfergus - were ravaged by recent rioting. This has led to the perception that paramilitaries there are being rewarded for encouraging the violence.

Mrs Foster defended the CIT scheme at a press conference last Wednesday, and dismissed any suggestion rioters or paramilitaries are being bought off. An Executive Office spokeswoman said: ""A budget of £10m has been allocated for the next three years as an initial contribution to the Communities in Transition initiative which will run until March 2024.

""A range of Phase 1 projects have already been extended to 30 June 2021. It is the intention of the Executive Office that Phase 2 of the programme will commence from 1 July 2021.""

The announcement was posted on the website of the U.S. Embassy in Chad, which pointed to the proximity of rebel groups to the nation's capital.

""On April 17, 2021, the Department ordered the departure of non-emergency U.S. government employees from U.S. Embassy N’Djamena due to civil unrest and armed violence,"" the warning read.

""Armed non-governmental groups in northern Chad have moved south and appear to be heading toward N’Djamena. Due to their growing proximity to N’Djamena, and the possibility for violence in the city, non-essential U.S. Government employees have been ordered to leave Chad by commercial airline. U.S. citizens in Chad wishing to depart should take advantage of commercial flights,"" it continued.

Rebel groups have frequently tried to overthrow Idriss Déby, Chad's self-proclaimed president who has ruled the country for more than three decades after launching a successful coup himself. Déby is supported by France and the U.S., which consider him and the country an important ally against Islamist extremists in the region.

Rebel forces posted on social media late last week that they had overtaken a Chadian army base in the country's northern region, while claiming that the army was receiving logistical support from France.

""The enemy, despite the logistical support of the French Air Force, was totally routed,"" read a statement from a Front for Change and Concord in Chad (FACT) spokesperson, according to Reuters.

France's defense ministry would not confirm to the news service whether it was involved in the ongoing security efforts in Chad.

Unless he breaks the conditions of his sentence, the suspended sentence means the man won’t actually have to spend time in prison.

“Lunch today! Egg dumplings with green salad!” the man posted, together with a photo. “Blondi is missing,” one of the defendant’s friends wrote, allegedly in reference to Hitler’s dog, according to ORF , an Austrian public broadcaster.

We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

The man, who has not been identified, shared the photograph on Facebook last year, on April 20, Hitler’s birthdate.

An Austrian police officer received a suspended prison sentence of ten months for posting the apparent favourite food of Adolf Hitler.

The defence’s argument that the photo was a coincidence, and that “Blondi” was in reference to a blonde beer, failed to convince the jury.

According to a 2016 report by Vice Germany, the dish may be used as a thinly-veiled code by neo-Nazis.

The police officer was found guilty by a vote of five to three, although the conviction could change, the broadcaster reported. He was given a ten-month suspended prison sentence and fined €6,300 ($9,500) at a regional court in Eisenstadt, eastern Austria. It’s unclear whether he will exercise his option to appeal.

The man was charged under the Verbotsgesetz 1947, also known as the Prohibition Act 1947, which aims to put an end to Nazi propaganda.

The man was temporarily suspended as a police officer, but had subsequently resumed duty. A spokesperson for Burgenland State Police Command said they’re determining further disciplinary action.

Hitler was born near the German border in Austria and later moved to Munich. In recent years, Austria has struggled to flush out the presence of far-right beliefs, including in politics. In 2018, the conservative government faced criticism for forming a coalition with the FPO after it came to light that some leaders participated in songs celebrating the Holocaust in a fraternity with ties to Nazis.

The far-right deputy mayor in the town of Braunau am Inn, where Hitler was born, had to step down in 2019 after referring to immigrants as “rats” in a poem.

The La Soufriere volcano on the eastern Caribbean island of St. Vincent erupted on Friday, sending a column of ash 10km into the sky. With some 16,000 people living in the ‘red zone’ near the volcano, the authorities had been scrambling to put together evacuation plans in the hours leading up to the blast.

For viewers following the evacuation effort through television news reports, one detail of the plan may have stood out. “Cruise ships are evacuating people from the island,” CBS News’ Norah O’Donnell announced on Friday, adding that “only those vaccinated against Covid” would be allowed to leave.

The clip, which has since raised some eyebrows online, turned out to be factually correct. St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ prime minister, Ralph Gonsalves, did announce in a press conference that evacuees would need to receive a Covid shot before boarding any of the two Royal Caribbean cruise ships and two Carnival Cruise Line’s vessels that arrived on Friday.

Furthermore, Gonsalves said that the neighboring islands of St. Lucia, Grenada, Barbados, and Antigua would accept evacuees, but only if they had been vaccinated.

To add to the horror on St Vincent, *only vaccinated* evacuees are being accepted on cruise ships or nearby islands. This is worse than my worst nightmares about vaccine segregation.

So... a volcano on St Vincent has erupted and cruise ships are evacuating residents in peril, but only if they've been vaccinated for Covid. We're through the looking glass, everybody. — Oliver Smith (@ollysmithtravel) April 10, 2021

However, despite Gonsalves’ announcement, neither Royal Caribbean nor Carnival Cruise Line have mentioned anything about keeping unvaccinated passengers off their ships. Royal Caribbean did say that “all precautions will be taken to protect the health and safety of the crew and passengers who board our ships,” but did not elaborate further. Nor have the governments of the aforementioned islands released any official statements clarifying whether or not they would accept unvaccinated evacuees.

Further complicating matters is the fact that St. Vincent received its first shipment of vaccines only two days before the eruption. Throughout the pandemic, St. Vincent and the Grenadines has recorded only 1,789 cases of Covid-19 and 10 deaths, according to figures from the World Health Organization.

WINDSOR, England (AP) — Sitting by herself at the funeral of Prince Philip on Saturday, Queen Elizabeth cut a regal but solitary figure: still the monarch, but now alone.

The queen sat apart from family members at the simple but somber ceremony at Windsor Castle, in accordance with strict social distancing rules during the coronavirus pandemic. But if the ceremony had been for anyone else, at her side would have been her husband of 73 years, who gave a lifetime of service to the crown.

Wearing a face mask, the queen was dressed all in black, except for the diamond brooch that flashed on her left shoulder — a piece she had often worn on engagements with her husband.

The monarch’s four children — Prince Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward — sat nearby, as did the queen and Philip’s eight grandchildren. The stripped-back service made their loss somehow more personal for people who often live their lives in public.

Just 30 mourners were allowed to attend the service for the prince, who died April 9 at the age of 99. The entire royal procession and funeral took place out of public view within the grounds of the castle, a 950-year-old royal residence 20 miles (30 kilometers) west of London, but was shown live on television.

Hundreds of people lined the streets outside the castle to pay their respects to the prince. Some held Union flags and clutched flowers, while others wore custom face masks featuring the royal’s photo.

“We have been inspired by his unwavering loyalty to our queen, by his service to the nation and the Commonwealth, by his courage, fortitude and faith,” the dean of Windsor, David Conner, said in his call to prayer.

The nation honored Philip with a minute’s silence observed across the United Kingdom at 3 p.m., its beginning and end marked by a gun fired by the King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery. The final shot signaled the start of a funeral service steeped in military and royal tradition, but infused with the duke’s personality.

Philip’s body was carried to St. George’s Chapel at the castle on a Land Rover that the prince himself had specially designed. It was followed by members of the Royal Family, including Princes William and Harry, who made their first public appearance together since Harry and his wife, Meghan, gave a controversial interview to U.S. television host Oprah Winfrey in which they discussed the difficulties of royal life and how the two brothers had grown apart.

The procession traversed the grounds of Windsor Castle, passing military detachments arrayed under bright blue skies.

Inside the medieval Gothic chapel, the setting for centuries of royal weddings and funerals, this service was quiet and without excessive pageantry. Philip was deeply involved in planning the ceremony. At his request, there was no sermon. There were also no eulogies or readings, in keeping with royal tradition.

ADVERTISEMENT

Former Bishop of London Richard Chartres, who knew Philip well, said the 50-minute service reflected the preferences of the prince, who was a man of faith but liked things to be succinct.

“He was at home with broad church, high church and low church, but what he really liked was short church,” Chartres told the BBC.

Philip’s coffin was draped with Philip’s personal standard, topped with his Admiral of the Fleet Naval Cap and sword. The sword was given to him by his father-in-law, King George VI, on the occasion of his marriage to the queen in 1947.

The monarch offered her own touches to the day. Ahead of the funeral, Buckingham Palace released a photo of the queen and Philip, smiling and relaxing on blankets in the grass in the Scottish Highlands in 2003. The palace said the casual, unposed photo was a favorite of the queen.

Composing a wreath atop the coffin were flowers chosen by the queen, including white lilies, small white roses, white freesia, white wax flower, white sweet peas and jasmine. A note from the monarch was attached, but its contents were not disclosed.

The funeral reflected Philip’s military ties, both as the ceremonial commander of many units and as a veteran of the Royal Navy who served with distinction during World War II. More than 700 military personnel took part in the commemorative events, including army bands, Royal Marine buglers and an honor guard drawn from across the armed forces.

Lt. Gen. Roland Walker, regimental lieutenant colonel of the Grenadier Guards, said his unit was honored to take part because of its close relationship with the prince. Philip served as regimental colonel of the guards, its honorary leader, for 42 years.

“This is a privilege,” he told the BBC. “Because my understanding is he planned this, so we’re here because he wanted us to be here, and that, I think, down to the junior guardsmen, is a known fact.”

William and Harry were part of the nine-member royal contingent, although their cousin, Peter Phillips, walked between them. There was no obvious tension between the brothers, whose relationship has been strained since Harry’s decision to quit royal duties and move to California. After the service, they walked back to the castle together, seeming to chat amiably.

Full Coverage: Prince Philip

Their appearance at the service stirred memories of the 1997 funeral of Princess Diana, when William and Harry, then 15 and 12, walked behind their mother’s coffin accompanied by Philip.

As Philip’s coffin was lowered into the Royal Vault, Royal Marine buglers sounded “Action Stations,” an alarm that alerts sailors to prepare for battle — included in the service at Philip’s request. He will rest there, at least until the queen’s death, alongside the remains of 24 other royals, including King George III, whose reign included the years of the American Revolution. The queen and Philip are expected to be buried together in the Royal Burial Ground on the Frogmore Estate close to Windsor Castle.

For decades, Philip was a fixture of British life, renowned for his founding of the Duke of Edinburgh’s Awards program that encouraged youths to challenge themselves and for a blunt-spoken manner that at times included downright offensive remarks. He lived in his wife’s shadow, but his death has sparked a reflection about his role, and new appreciation from many in Britain.

“To be perfectly honest I didn’t realize the extent (of) what his life had been, what he had done for us all,” said Viv Davies, who came to pay her respects in Windsor. “He was a marvelous husband, wasn’t he, to the queen and the children? Just remarkable — and I don’t think we will see the like again.”

MOSCOW (AP) — An American astronaut and two Russians have returned to Earth after six months aboard the International Space Station.

A Soyuz space capsule carrying NASA’s Kate Rubins and Russians Sergey Ryzhikov and Sergey Kud-Sverchkov landed at 0455 GMT (12:55 a.m. EDT) Saturday in the steppes of Kazakhstan.

Dmitry Rogozin, head of the Russian space agency Roskosmos, said all three were feeling well after they were extracted from the capsule and began reacclimating to the pull of gravity.

The three had arrived at the orbiting laboratory complex on Oct. 14.

0,Ukraine top security official believes Iran downed Ukrainian plane intentionally,https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2021/04/16/Ukraine-top-security-official-believes-Iran-downed-Ukrainian-plane-intentionally,"Ukraine’s security chief said he believes the downing of a Ukrainian passenger plane by Iran’s military over Tehran in January 2020 was an intentional act rather than an accident as claimed by the Iranian regime.

Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, told Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail in an interview published on Friday, that he believes the incident was a “conscious attack.”

For all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app.



“When they say this was accidental … I don’t buy that,” Danilov told The Globe and Mail. “It was intentional. This was a conscious attack.”

He said that Iran’s refusal to allow international investigators full access to the evidence has led him to believe that Tehran downed the plane intentionally.

“Iran does not allow anybody to examine this tragedy, and they postpone or slow down any investigations. The fact that they are investigating themselves is rather surprising, to put it politely,” Danilov said.

Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) shot down the Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 on January 8, 2020, killing all 176 people on board. The majority of passengers were Iranian. Citizens from Canada, Ukraine, Britain and Afghanistan were also among the passengers.

After denying responsibility for three days, Iran admitted to downing the plane, declaring it a “disastrous mistake.”

Danilov’s hypothesis is that Iran was looking for a way to prevent a tit-for-tat situation with the United States.

Hours before the plane was shot down, Iran had struck US military bases in Iraq in response to the US killing of the commander of the IRGC’s Quds Force Gen. Qassem Soleimani days earlier.

Iran wanted to make sure there would be no US response to its attack on American military bases in Iraq, according to Danilov.

“Since January 8 of last year, the question has remained in my head: ‘Why do they do this?’ If you remember MH17, which the Russians shot down on the order of military authorities … active military actions came to a halt after this crash, because the whole world was focused on understanding what happened,” he said, referring to the downing of flight Malaysia Airlines in 2014.

“If you project this logic onto what happened on January 8, there was the Soleimani assassination, after which total war was expected. After shooting down the plane and killing our citizens, among others, this [total war] went from first priority to 10th priority,” Danilov added.

Through these remarks, Danilov, as Ukraine’s security chief, is representing the Ukrainian government, Ukraine’s deputy Foreign Minister Yevhen Yenin told The Globe and Mail.

“We don’t believe the version of human error until we see the evidence.” Yenin said, according to the newspaper.

Rehana Dhirani, whose father Asghar Dhirani died in the crash, wrote on Twitter on Friday: “We’ve always known #PS752 was intentional, the excuse of ‘human error’ is a pathetic attempt to cover the actions of the regime.”

Last month, Iran published its final report into the incident. “The plane was identified as a hostile target due to a mistake by the air defence operator...near Tehran and two missiles were fired at it,” the report said, according to the website of Iran’s civil aviation body.

Commenting on the Iranian report, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba described it as, “nothing more than a cynical attempt to hide the true reasons for the downing of our plane.”

“We will not allow Iran to hide the truth, we will not allow it to avoid responsibility for this crime,” Kuleba wrote on Facebook.

In December, Canada’s former foreign minister Francois-Philippe Champagne had also said he does not believe Iranian claims that the plane was shot down as a result of “human error.”

Iran denies

Iran’s foreign ministry rejected Danilov’s accusations on Friday.

“It is unfortunate that, despite all the explanations and expert reports, some Ukrainian officials continue to make vague political statements and present their own personal hypotheses in the media,” foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said, according to the semi-official Fars news agency.

It is not an exaggeration to say that the history of mathematics was radically changed the moment they came into contact with this sorry ass fuck.” Cornish went on to explain that this ancient Sumerian loser was so powerfully vacuous, that word of his lameness later spread across the globe to the Mayans, the Indians, and the Europeans.

A former flight attendant, he borrowed from relatives and poured his $5,000 life savings into opening a clothing shop on the outskirts of Delhi selling custom-designed suits, shirts and pants.

The shop, called the Right Fit, opened in February 2020, just weeks before the coronavirus struck India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi abruptly enacted one of the world’s toughest nationwide lockdowns to stop it. Unable to pay the rent, Mr. Anand closed the Right Fit two months later.

Now Mr. Anand, his wife and his two children are among millions of people in India in danger of sliding out of the middle class and into poverty. They depend on handouts from his aging in-laws. Khichdi, or watery lentils cooked with rice, has replaced eggs and chicken at the dinner table. Sometimes, he said, the children go to bed hungry.

“I have nothing left in my pocket,” said Mr. Anand, 38. “How can I not give food to my children?”

Things are already getting complicated.",https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/04/demise-arecibo-and-rise-chinas-fast-telescope/618608/,"Until, that is, FAST opened to astronomers, for the first time since its construction finished in 2016. After that initial completion, scientists and engineers spent years commissioning it and bringing it up to full scientific operation. They deemed it ready for proposals from would-be users in China early last year. “The timeline was very tight, and it was extremely difficult to get everything ready for opening to the world [at] that time,” Keping Qiu, a professor in the School of Astronomy and Space Science at Nanjing University, wrote in an email to Undark. Qiu leads the committee that will evaluate the incoming ideas and added, “The FAST group worked very hard over the past year, and now the telescope is making the step forward” by opening up to the world.

Read: What happens if China makes first contact?

If the international researchers’ ideas pass muster, those scientists will get approximately 10 percent of the telescope’s time, and the remaining 90 percent will go to Chinese scientists. “We expect that FAST would not only take the place of Arecibo in supporting astronomers doing good science in relevant research areas,” Qiu said, “but also make breakthroughs and open new windows for research in radio astronomy.”

This kind of shared use mirrors the way many large observatories around the world work, in which an Open Skies policy lets anyone from anywhere compete for observing time. It also reflects China’s broader efforts to host world-class facilities that foreign researchers envy—a flex of global muscle. But scientific tensions and suspicions currently run high between the U.S. and China: American researchers have faced increasing censure for taking undisclosed money from China, the U.S. fears its rival would like to steal intellectual property, and concrete restrictions exist for certain space scientists who’d like to work across these particular borders. Current federal law in the U.S., for instance, severely limits NASA and its scientists from working on projects with China and its scientists. Collaboration, it turns out, rarely comes without complication.

But American and Chinese astronomers both hope this particular opportunity will nevertheless work smoothly for both sides. “Observatories generally feel that they benefit by having an influx. The more people from more places that come through and use the telescope,” Cordes says, “it kind of lifts all boats, that rising tide.”

Cordes and colleagues are hoping to use FAST at some point for work on a project called NANOGrav (short for North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves). The group watches to see if pulsars’ pulses, which are emitted like clockwork, arrive delayed or early. In aggregate, that messy timetable indicates that ripples in the fabric of the universe, called gravitational waves, are stretching or squishing said fabric. But to get the job done, astronomers must spy every couple of weeks on a network of pulsars, for which they had previously used both Arecibo and America’s next-largest instrument, the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope, in West Virginia. When Arecibo collapsed, the team was left looking for a new instrument.",503,3180,22,148

Tel Aviv said the strike was a reprisal for a rocket fired into Israel earlier.

Reports of the bombing came shortly after 1am local time on Friday, with eyewitnesses sharing videos purportedly showing explosions and claiming F-16 fighters were attacking.

The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed the bombing and said it was in “response to the rocket fired from Gaza at Israel earlier tonight.”

Fighter jets and helicopters struck “a Hamas weapons manufacturing site, a weapon smuggling tunnel and a military post,” the IDF said on Twitter.

The rocket that the IDF was referencing came from the direction of Gaza on Thursday evening – as Israel was celebrating its independence day – and struck uninhabited territory near the town of Sderot in southern Israel.

While Tel Aviv blamed the attack on Palestinian Islamic Jihad, one of the several militant groups operating out of the enclave, the reprisal was aimed at Hamas in line with the Israeli policy of holding that group responsible for anything that happens in Gaza.

Hamas – which stands for “Islamic Resistance Movement” – is a Palestinian faction headquartered in Gaza. It has de facto been the government of the enclave since Israel withdrew its troops from the 365-square-kilometer (141-square-mile) strip in 2005.

After dozens of missiles were fired from the strip into Israel in February, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu threatened Gaza with all-out war.

Gaza was occupied by Egypt during the war that followed Israel’s declaration of independence in 1948. It was captured by the Israelis in the 1967 war against Egypt, Syria and Jordan – along with the Jordanian-held West Bank and the Golan Heights region of Syria. The Sinai peninsula, also occupied during the so-called Six-Day War, was returned to Egypt in 1980.

Go! Go!” as an alarm blared, President Donald Trump reportedly threw a garbage can through a McDonald’s window early Tuesday morning before looting $2,000 in Big Macs. According to sources, Trump, seemingly oblivious to the broken glass sticking out of his arm, then proceeded to stuff dozens of Filet-O-Fish sandwiches down the front of his shirt, grab a box of M&M McFlurry toppings, and jump out the window with a duffel bag ove rflowing with Big Macs and french fries, all before returning back inside the restaurant to put his mouth under the soft-serve machine again. Several eyewitness accounts confirmed that when law enforcement officers arrived at the scene, Secret Service members were protecting the president as chocolate shake dripped from his pockets and numerous apple pies tumbled from his grasp to the glass-strewn concrete. At press time, Trump had reportedly ordered Washington, D.C. to enact yet another curfew so that he could “hit the Baskin-Robbins tomorrow.”

Just look at all these stars—you can’t even see them back at The House, what with the light pollution and the 12 inches of reinforced concrete.” Howell added that despite their efforts to stay “off the grid,” their respite would probably only last a few more days before they were called back to address mundane concerns, such as the three guards they murdered while setting out.

A new fundraising scheme has been set up to assist with the restoration of Paris's Notre-Dame Cathedral after the 2019 fire, encouraging contributors to ""adopt"" a piece of history at the 12-century Gothic landmark.

The Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris last week launched the website restorenotredame.org, which allows people to sponsor precious artworks, artefacts or even gargoyles that were damaged in the 2019 fire.

The blaze brought down the cathedral's towering spire and roof. The majority of the structure remained intact thanks to the rib vaulting, which saved centuries of priceless heritage central to French culture and history.

Among the precious relics: what is said to be Jesus' crown of thorns and a part of the cross from his crucifixion, as well as the Tunic of St Louis.

The item which had generated most interest and emotion was probably the 14th-century Virgin of the Pillar, which ""attracts the attention of believers because it is the Virgin Mary in all her beauty and significance"", according to Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris president, Michel Picaud.

New mission

The group was first set up in 2017 to raise 110 million euros to repair damage caused by wear and tear and pollution, as well as inferior materials used in the original construction. No major restoration work had been carried out on the monument since the mid-19th century.

The 2019 fire caused an outpouring of international concern – and gave the mission of the Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris even greater urgency. Over 830 million euros has since been donated from more than 150 countries.

Two years on, the repairs are well underway, but lengthy and complex operations remain in order to achieve the ambitious target set by President Emmanuel Macron of restoring the cathedral to its former glory and reopening to the public by April 2024.

The cause of the inferno that transfixed viewers the world over remains uncertain, but investigators have so far rejected any idea of foul play, suggesting a short-circuit or a discarded cigarette could have been to blame.

But what really got me was hearing from the 12-year-old who might become fatherless in 2021 if his dad gets a chance to believe the president about another disproven cure for Covid-19.” At press time, the RNC was airing a short sentimental tribute set to “(I’ve Had) The Time Of My Life” dedicated to all 1,500,000 future victims of the pandemic after a 2020 Trump victory.

From reporting under 10,000 new daily cases earlier this year, daily infections crossed 200,000 on Thursday, according to official data, the highest anywhere in the world.

At Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital (LNJP), one of India’s largest COVID-only facilities with more than 1,500 beds, a stream of ambulances ferried patients to the overflowing casualty ward on Thursday.

Some also arrived in buses and three-wheeled autorickshaws.

The youngest patient was a new-born baby.

“We are definitely over-burdened. We are already working at full capacity,” said the hospital’s medical director, Suresh Kumar.

From an initial 54 beds, the hospital now has over 300 for COVID-19 patients in critical condition. Even that is not enough.

Unrelated patients share beds, while bodies of the recently deceased lie outside the ward before being taken to the mortuary.

“Today we have 158 admissions in Lok Nayak alone,” Kumar said. Almost all were severe cases.

After imposing one of the world’s strictest lockdowns for nearly three months last year, India’s government relaxed almost all curbs by the beginning of 2021, although many regions have now introduced localised restrictions.

LNJP’s Kumar said fast-spreading new variants that evade testing were adding to the burden, as was human behaviour as the country reopened.

“People are not following the COVID guidelines,” he said. “They are just careless.”

Outside the hospital’s mortuary, weeping relatives gathered in the hot sun to wait for the bodies of loved ones to be released.

Prashant Mehra, 40, said he had to pay a broker for preferential treatment before he could get his 90-year-old grandfather admitted to the hospital. The hospital did not immediately respond to a request for comment on his remarks.

Mehra said the effort made little difference in the end.

“He died after six or seven hours,” he said. “We already asked for our money back.”",339,2126,12,62

REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov

The European Union must pressure Moscow to allow Alexei Navalny to have access to his doctor, allies of the hunger-striking Kremlin critic wrote in a letter sent this week to EU foreign ministers.

Navalny, 44, a prominent opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin, announced a hunger strike at the end of March in protest at what he said was the refusal of prison authorities to treat him properly for acute back and leg pain.

Two allies of Navalny, Vladimir Ashurkov and Leonid Volkov, wrote to the 27 EU ministers to urge them to discuss Navalny's health at their next meeting on Monday, according to a copy of the letter seen by Reuters.

""Alexei must immediately be granted his lawful request for a doctor of his choice,"" said the letter, which was also sent to the parliaments of EU member states.

The letter raised similar health concerns to those voiced on Tuesday by Navalny's wife, who said after visiting him in prison that he was having difficulty speaking and had lost more weight.

""Alexei's health is steadily deteriorating,"" the letter said, citing an unofficial copy of test results that showed spinal problems.

""He now feels numbness not only in his both legs, but also in his left hand, along with pain in his back and muscular impairment,"" the letter said.

""Alexei is also suffering from a fever and a heavy cough. Several inmates in his penal colony unit have recently been diagnosed with tuberculosis,"" it added.

Navalny, who the West says has been wrongly jailed and should be freed, returned to Russia in January after recovering from what German doctors say was a nerve agent poisoning.

He was jailed in February for two and a half years for parole violations that he called politically motivated. Russia has said it has yet to see evidence he was poisoned.

Staff at the Russian prison said they have offered Navalny proper treatment, but that he refused it. read more

Russia’s prisons service said on Tuesday that a panel of doctors assessed Navalny’s health as satisfactory and that he was transferred from the clinic back to the main part of the prison on April 9, the RIA news agency quoted it as saying.

0,Researchers integrate human stem cells into monkey embryo,https://www.dw.com/en/researchers-integrate-human-stem-cells-into-monkey-embryo/a-57224980,"A team of scientists from China and the United States has reached a breakthrough in the field of stem cell research. The scientists injected human stem cells into monkey blastocytes, an early structure in embryonic development in mammals. The team around lead researcher Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte then managed to keep some of the embryos made up of two different genetic materials alive for up to 20 days. A ""mixed"" organism like this is also known as chimeric, or an interspecies chimera.

Izpisua Belmonte and his team at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in California cooperated with a group of Chinese researchers led by Weizhi Ji at Kunming University of Science and Technology in Yunnan. Their study on chimeric human-primate embryos was published on Thursday in the renowned natural science journal Cell.

Chimeras in mammals have been made since the 1970s to study early developmental processes. The difference: Back then, scientists used rodents, and the interspecies organisms usually didn't survive for very long. The big step that made the new study possible came last year when the Chinese team at Kunming University developed technology that allowed monkey embryos to stay alive and grow outside the body for an extended period of time.

""Historically, the generation of human-animal chimeras has suffered from low efficiency and integration of human cells into the host species,"" Izpisua Belmonte said. The advances now published in Cell will help scientists understand better how chimeras work and in turn, how to improve them for further research.

The macaque's blastocyst, an early stage of embryonic develpment, after researchers inserted human stem cells

That's how it's done ― but what about the why?

Mixing human stem cells with animals' genetic material is a significant intervention into nature's course, but the researchers say they have good reason for it.

""As we are unable to conduct certain types of experiments in humans, it is essential that we have better models to more accurately study and understand human biology and disease,"" Izpisu Belmonte explained.

In Cell, the study's authors further explain that their work generating chimera with human stem cells ""might constitute a promising strategy for various regenerative medicine applications, including the generation of organs and tissues for transplantation.""

The work of Izpisu Belmonte and his colleagues has been harshly criticized, too, though.

""I think the research is of very low quality,"" Alfonso Martinez Arias, an affiliated lecturer in the department of genetics at the University of Cambridge, said in a comment on the study provided to the independent Science Media Centre in the UK. From looking at the researchers' data, Martinez Arias said, ""it is impossible to see what they say is there.""

Cell is a peer-reviewed journal, meaning that each study that is published undergoes a rigorous process in which a panel of scientists reviews the material and results provided by the study's authors. The fact that Izpisu Belmonte's work was published in Cell means that none of the experts reviewing it shared Martinez Arias' concerns.

With science's progress, more and more things become possible ― but ethical concerns remain.

What is a human being?

That still leaves ethical questions. In the current study, the embryos didn't survive past 20 days. But what happens when science eventually gets to the point that chimeras like these turn into fully formed beings?

""This research opens Pandora's box to human-nonhuman chimeras,"" Julian Savulescu, Director of the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics at the University of Oxford, said in his comment to the Science Media Centre. To him, the key ethical question relates to what kind of creatures these chimeras would be ― to what extent can they think and feel? Would it be acceptable to take organs from them that were grown for transplant purposes?

""What is the moral status of these novel creatures?"" Savulescu wrote. ""Before any experiments are performed on live-born chimeras, or their organs extracted, it is essential that their mental capacities and lives are properly assessed.""

Anna Smajdor, associate professor of practical philosophy at the University of Oslo, even went a step further.

""This breakthrough reinforces an increasingly inescapable fact: biological categories are not fixed ― they are fluid,"" she said in her comment to the Science Media Centre. ""The scientists behind this research state that these chimeric embryos offer new opportunities, because 'we are unable to conduct certain types of experiments in humans'. But whether these embryos are human or not is open to question.""",739,4684,8,57
0,India Covid: Thousands gather for dung-throwing festival as cases top 200k in a day,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9473727/India-Covid-Thousands-gather-dung-throwing-festival-cases-200k-day.html/,"India's two biggest cities have been shutdown amid spiralling Covid infections which saw a record 200,000 new cases on Thursday.

Patients have been packed two to a bed at one hospital in Delhi, where, along with Mumbai, stringent new lockdown rules have been imposed to curb the spread.

The soaring deaths and cases come just months after India thought it had seen the worst of the pandemic - and have forced the country to delay exports of vaccines abroad.

Despite the perilous situation, footage has emerged of villagers in Andhra Pradesh hurling cow dung at each other as part of religious celebrations.

Similar recent mass gatherings, including hundreds of thousands bathing in the Ganges, have been blamed for being 'super-spreader' events.

At Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital (LNJP) in Delhi, one of India's largest COVID-only facilities with more than 1,500 beds, a stream of ambulances ferried patients to the overflowing casualty ward on Thursday.

Thousands of villagers gathered in Kairuppala, a village in southern India, on Wednesday to take part in an annual festival where participants pelt each-other with cow dung (pictured)

The festival, which is supposed to guarantee peace, good health and prosperity, was allowed to go ahead despite India's soaring Covid second wave

India reported 200,739 new cases of Covid on Thursday amid a rapidly-spreading second wave of Covid that doctors fear is being driven by a new mutation

Deaths are also beginning to spike and have remained above 1,000 for two days in a row, with medics fearful that they are fighting a more-deadly version of the disease

Some also arrived in buses and three-wheeled autorickshaws.

The youngest patient was a new-born baby.

'We are definitely over-burdened. We are already working at full capacity,' said the hospital's medical director, Suresh Kumar.

From an initial 54 beds, the hospital now has over 300 for COVID-19 patients in critical condition. Even that is not enough.

Unrelated patients share beds, while bodies of the recently deceased lie outside the ward before being taken to the mortuary.

'Today we have 158 admissions in Lok Nayak alone,' Kumar said. Almost all were severe cases.

Delhi announced stay-at-home orders for the weekend, though essential workers will be able to move about if they have a pass from local authorities.

Restaurants, malls, gyms and spas will be shut down. Movie theaters will close on weekends, but can operate on weekdays at a third of their capacity.

Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi's top elected official, said that despite rise in infections, 5,000 hospital beds are still available in the capital and more capacity is being added.

But still, more than a dozen hotels and wedding banquet halls were ordered to be converted into COVID-19 centres where doctors from nearby hospitals will treat the moderately ill.

'The surge is alarming,' said S.K. Sarin, a government health expert in New Delhi.

The moves in the capital came after similar measures were imposed in the worst-hit state of Maharashtra, home to financial capital, Mumbai.

The bustle of India's biggest city ebbed after authorities closed most industries, businesses and public places Wednesday night and put limits on the movement of people for 15 days. Train and plane travel was still allowed, however.

In recent days, the city has seen an exodus of panic-stricken day laborers, hauling backpacks and flocking to overcrowded trains.

Dozens of other towns and cities have also imposed nighttime curfews.

The surge in cases was weighing on hospitals in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and several other states, where many reported a shortage of oxygen tanks. Imran Sheikh, a resident of the city of Pune in Maharashtra, said he was asked to supply his own oxygen tank for a relative undergoing COVID-19 treatment.

Cremation and burial grounds in the worst-hit areas were finding it difficult to cope with the increasing number of bodies arriving for last rites, according to Indian media reports.

Shahid Jamil, a virologist, said the recent local and state elections with massive political rallies and a major Hindu festival during which hundreds of thousands of devotees bathed in the Ganges river were super-spreader events.

Today new footage emerged of the dung-throwing event - known as pidakala samara - taking place in the village of Kairuppala, in Andhra Pradesh - the day after lunar new year celebrations.

It marks a mythological marriage dispute between two deities which was resolved by village elders, according to legend, and villagers believe that re-enacting the dispute and its peaceful conclusion each year will bring peace, health and prosperity.

The packed event was allowed to go ahead despite India's soaring Covid infection rate.

The 200,739 new infections recorded Thursday are about twice the number of daily cases that were recorded during the last peak, in September.

The Health Ministry also reported 1,038 deaths from COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, pushing the toll over 173,000.

Participants in the festival are split into 'teams' along caste and religious lines - representing two side in a mythical marriage dispute - before battling with dung

Police said 100 people were injured during the fight (pictured, men with bruised faces) though none of them was seriously hurt

Dr Shashank Joshi, who is leading India's Covid response in hardest-hit city of Mumbai, described the soaring infections as a 'tsunami' that has caught the government completely unawares.

The health system is already close to be overwhelmed, he said, with hospitals pleading for supplies of key medicines including oxygen to keep patients alive.

Dr Joshi told The Guardian that the second wave is affecting both young and old, with even children - previously spared the worst affects of Covid - now being brought into hospital with severe infections.

It comes just two months after the government was toasting its own success in fighting Covid as cases and deaths appeared to be in decline - though medics warned at the time that patchy testing meant many were being missed.

While the new surge has not been fully explained, medics theorise that it could be down to a new variant of the disease which is both more infectious and more deadly.

Similar virus mutations in the UK, Brazil and South Africa sent cases and deaths soaring in those countries and forced governments to take tougher measures to combat the infections.

India has been slow to respond to the spike, with Maharashtra state - the worst-hit - the only one so-far ordered into lockdown, which began yesterday.

For the next 15 days only essential services will be allowed to operate, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said, while gatherings have been limited to four people and non-essential use of public transport outlawed.

Indian medical workers in the city of Mumbai, which has been hardest-hit by the Covid second wave, prepare a body for cremation on Tuesday

Health authorities in Mumbai say hospitals are running short of key supplies including oxygen as the city is overwhelmed by a wave of Covid

But mass gatherings have continued elsewhere unabated, with thousands of Hindu devotees gathering to pray on the banks of the Ganges earlier this week during the festival of Kumbh Mela.

And in Andhra Pradesh, New Year celebrations such as pidakala samara have been allowed to go ahead with no sign of social distancing or mask wearing.

The festival traces its origins back to a mythological marriage between two deities of different castes who wished to marry, sparking a war between people of the village.

Village elders eventually resolved the dispute and the marriage was solemnised, restoring peace to Kairuppa.

Each year, the village is divided along religious and caste lines and each side lines up to hurl cow dung cakes - which are made a month ahead of time - at the other.

After the fight is over, processions are led out and village elders ritually bless the marriage of Lord Veerabhadra Swamy and Kalika Devi which is thought to bring peace, health and prosperity to the village.

Police said 100 people were injured in this year's celebrations, though none were seriously hurt.

Other traditional New Year celebrations in Andhra Pradesh state include leading donkeys through a pond of sludge that is poured around a temple, before washing and adorning the animals, which are then worshipped.

In total, India has reported more than 14million cases of Covid - the world's second-highest total after the US.

The country has also recorded 173,000 deaths, the fourth highest total in the world, though experts warn that is almost certainly a gross underestimate.

It is thought that just 20 per cent of deaths in India are medically registered with an official cause of death given, with experts saying the true death toll could be two or three times the official figure.",1444,8897,14,83

0,Germany's Far Right Is Surging Again.,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/13/trial-of-12-men-accused-of-planning-far-right-terror-attacks-opens-in-stuttgart,"The trial of 12 men accused of planning a series of far-right terror attacks on asylum seekers, Muslims, Jews and politicians in an attempt to overthrow German democracy has opened in the city of Stuttgart.

Gruppe S (Group S) was named after Werner S, a 55-year-old junk salesman, who is believed to have established it in 2019 and been its leader. He has described himself as a “free spirit with leanings towards National Socialism”. The like-minded men he brought to the group sought to trigger a situation akin to a civil war, according to federal prosecutors.

Eleven of the men are on trial for membership of a terrorist organisation and violating weapons laws. The 12th stands accused of supporting a terrorist group.

The accused include a tiler, a nurse, security guards and an administration secretary with the police. Several of the men had links to or membership of other far-right groups including the organisation Bruderschaft Deutschland, considered to be a collecting point for rightwing extremists and counting hooligans, bouncers and martial artists among its members.

The prosecutors said the men, aged between 33 and 62, were German nationals who had an “openly Nazi attitude” to life, doing nothing to hide their anti-foreigner sentiment. Some have tattoos bearing Nazi symbols, including a swastika, an image of Hitler in uniform, the word “Aryan” and the Imperial war flag of the German empire.

In a chat group on the platform Telegram, one of the accused allegedly referred to black people as “subhuman, so up for a massacre”. The men used codenames when talking to one another on the telephone. They met for discussions and shooting practice with their ultimate aim being to establish a new societal order, according to the prosecution.

One man is said to have told his girlfriend he was prepared to “die in battle” for the organisation’s cause.

The men are also accused of arranging to purchase weapons and ammunition valued at about €50,000 (£43,000) via a dealer known to one of them. Other weapons were found during raids on the men’s homes and other properties.

One of the attacks they planned was against the co-leader of the Green party, Robert Habeck, prosecutors said.

Gruppe S’s members had connections to several rightwing extremist groupings, using the networks they built on to recruit new members, and calling on “fast, clever and brutal fighters” to join their cause.

Eight of the 12 men appeared in court hiding their faces behind case binders. They were seated behind bulletproof glass.

The group came to light after a man identified only as Paul U, an erstwhile member, became disillusioned with the group and blew its cover by informing the police. The police raided homes and properties linked to the group on 14 February last year, since when the men have been held in custody.

A bespectacled Paul U appeared in court dressed in a navy blue anorak, its hood and his medical face mask covering almost his entire face. He has been denounced by the group’s members as a traitor, and has police protection.

Paul U told the judge he could not give his address for reasons of his safety. He has told investigators the group was founded at a barbecue area on the edge of a remote forest near the town of Altdorf in Baden-Württemberg.

The trial is taking place against a backdrop of growing concern about the rise of violent rightwing crime in Germany, with the number of extremist incidents rising to a four-year high last year, according to police statistics released in February.

High-profile rightwing extremist attacks have rocked the country in recent years, leading the interior minister, Horst Seehofer, to call far-right terrorism “the biggest security threat” facing the country.

In January Stephan Ernst, a neo-Nazi, was sentenced to life in prison for murdering the Christian Democratic Union politician Walter Lübcke due to his support of pro-migration policies.

In February last year, a far-right extremist operating alone gunned down 10 people and wounding five others in the central city of Hanau.

In 2019 two people were killed after a neo-Nazi attacker tried to burst into a synagogue in Halle on the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur.

The current trial is taking place amid high security in Stammheim prison in the north of Stuttgart, where the men are being held. It is the same complex in which the Red Army Faction urban guerrilla terrorist group were held in the 1970s, as well as where their trials took place.

The trial is expected to continue until August.",754,4532,6,37

I don’t understand why everyone seems to be so angry lately. Everywhere you look, there are marches, protests, riots—and all of it over so-called racism in our great country. I just don’t get it. I really don’t. But maybe that’s because, when I look at my fellow Americans, I don’t see a particular race or color. In fact, all I see is just a series of muted, roughly person-shaped silhouettes.

Advertisement

And this world would be a much better place if everyone else did, too.

If we want to go forward as a country, we have to move beyond race once and for all. It’s 2014! Why is it so hard for people to look past each other’s race, like I do, and see everyone as vaporous, beige-ish forms with limbs? All those blurry, vaguely human-shaped troublemakers shouting in the streets and the translucent bleeding-heart blobs moralizing on TV may feel the need to categorize everyone they see by their skin color, but I don’t give it a second thought. I wouldn’t even know how!

Advertisement

Take, for example, the recent deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, which sparked widespread outrage over “institutional racism.” These protesters are stuck in the past. They haven’t progressed enough to see that we’re all just grayish-brown smudges between approximately 4 and 6 and a half feet tall. They are part of the problem! Whereas they see “black” victims and “white” police, I just see amorphous clouds of the same basic hue, some of which have guns.

Like Martin Luther King Jr., who spoke for nondescript blotches everywhere, I judge a man not based on the color of his skin, but on the content of his character. And I’ll be the first to admit that the civil rights era was important. It made sure that everyone, no matter what fuzzy, neutral tint their ill-defined, human-like shape happens to be, could enjoy the same liberties as anyone else. But it’s not the 1960s anymore, and the very idea of race is ridiculous now. We have a fuzzy, neutral-tinted president, for crying out loud! Get over it.

I’m not saying this is an easy road to walk. In fact, in many respects, the way I see the world has made my life a living hell. I don’t know who anyone is. I have no way to tell where one person ends and another begins. I’ve been married for 13 years and I honestly do not know what race my husband is, let alone his gender. I assume he is alive, but there’s no actual proof of that. I have no clue what my children look like, or if I have children, or if they are dogs. The universe is a terrifying orchestra of matter and sound not tethered to any discernible reality. I am literally living in horror every moment of my life.

But you don’t see me rioting in the streets about it, do you?

People ask me all the time if I have any black friends, and my answer is, I have no idea. What is black? Are the globs who are good at basketball “black”? Or are the globs who are good at math “black”? Like I said, I don’t see race, because I am not capable of discerning any physical difference between the nebulous tangle of lifesmears that comprise all of humanity. People accuse me—me!—of being racist. I am the least racist person in the world! How can it be racism if all I can see are fleeting wisps of electromagnetic activity and a shimmering aura that represents each person’s individual essence?

0,How To Cut Your Inheritance Taxes (Best 5 Ways) for 2021,https://wikyi.com/how-to-cut-your-inheritance-taxes-best-5-ways/,"Best Way On How To Cut Your Inheritance Taxes

If you believe that your estate may need you to pay inheritance tax, we’ve gathered for you 5 simple and easy ways to reduce taxes significantly. Here are the best 5 ways to reduce tax without changing anything in your will. Here are 5 ways on How To Cut Your Inheritance Taxes :

You might be able to win against Inheritance Tax by simply giving away your estate, setting up a trust or changing your will. But be careful to pay attention to any legal consequences you may have afterwards.

If you are married or are in a civil partnership, you can give anything you own at the moment to your wife/husband or civil partner, in some states or countries this will not be possible if the other person was not born in the same country or the amount you may be limited to a specific amount. Using this method you will not have to pay Inheritance Tax on the price of the gift/s.

Some of the rules when gifting are complicated so you might need to take some legal advice.

The second advice on How To Cut Your Inheritance Taxes is : When you give anything to one of your friends or a family member that you are not married to, the price of the gift will still be included in your Inheritance Tax for your assets, but only for the next 7 years.

Thus, if giving your children some money and then living more than 7 years, it will not be taken into consideration when calculating the inheritance tax after your death.

The catch is that you can give away only limited amounts of money every single year so that you will not have to pay inheritance tax.

So, you can give away no more than $3000 a year, but you can give to your children and/or grandchildren when they are getting married.

But the thing is that you need to be aware of Capital Gains Tax as sometimes you may need to pay for certain estate.

The safest route is by checking with your lawyer or accountant if you are not sure if you need to pay Capital Gains Tax or not.

The third advice on How To Cut Your Inheritance Taxes is : If you put in a trust a part of your money, property or things that you have invested into out of witch no children of yours or spouse will be able to benefit from, you will no longer need to pay Inheritance Tax for it.

So, you can set up a trust for your legal (over 18) children, pay for your grandchildren education or even pay for a family member’s medical bills.

You can make a trust right now or you can put it in your will. How To Make Your Will – Step By Step Guide

There again can be Capital Gains Tax consequences if you transfer certain estate into a trust during your life, but no Capital Gains Tax will exist if you create a trust in your will

Keep in mind the fact that a few types of trusts can be subjected to their own tax regimes and the trust might be subjected to its own inheritance tax.

Also, persons that benefit from a trust are likely to have to pay 45% on Income Tax and 28% Capital Gains Tax.

Some rules about trusts can be complicated so you should seek advice from an expert.

The forth advice on How To Cut Your Inheritance Taxes is : Everything that you give to a charity will be free of inheritance tax, thus it can be a good way to reduce your inheritance tax, and at the same time do a good cause.

If you are going to leave 10% of your assets to charity, it will cut how much inheritance tax is due on the rest.

That way, the calculation rate for the inheritance tax sill be only 36%, instead of 40%.

The rate is going to be against the balance of the assets that exceed $325 000, but it can be lowered by gifting certain assets.

You may think that this is not a big saving, but it means that your family and your friends are going to receive more stuff than they would otherwise, and at the same time a charity will also benefit.

If you are going to take out the life insurance policy, it will not reduce the amount of inheritance tax to pay on your estate, but the payout may make it easier for your family and/ or friends to pay the taxes.

It can mean that because of this they will be able to prevent the family house from being sold

If you are going to do this step, you need to make sure that the life insurance payout will go into a trust, in contrary, it will make your estate bigger and they will have to pay even more.",834,4310,11,56
1,Conservative Evangelical Asks God To Give Her Strength To Incorporate Forced Hysterectomies Into Belief System,https://www.theonion.com/conservative-evangelical-asks-god-to-give-him-strength-1845065847,"CORDOVA, TN—Praying that the Lord Almighty would help her understand the recent whistleblower reports about Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s treatment of migrant detainees, conservative evangelical woman Melissa Carson reportedly asked God Tuesday to give her strength to incorporate forced hysterectomies into her belief system. “Lord, show me how the forced removal of the uterus from multiple imprisoned women is evidence of our salvation by grace alone,” said the devout evangelical woman, scanning her Bible for a verse or two that might offer a reason for why ICE-affiliated physicians were performing hysterectomies on detained women, many of whom did not speak English and were not given information or choice about the procedures. “I know I’m asking an awful lot of you, Lord, but my religion teaches me that all life is sacred, and although I know you move in mysterious ways, I confess I am confused as to how forced hysterectomies fit into that. You are just testing me, Lord, and I know that, but I am going to need a little bit of divine help to understand this one.” At press time, Carson was praising the Lord for his guidance after remembering that the hysterectomies were completely justified because President Donald Trump was a divine being simply carrying out God’s will.

With sperm donors deterred from travelling to hospitals during the pandemic, doctors at public fertility clinics say the worsening shortage could result in years-long delays for assisted pregnancy treatments.

""Because of the pandemic, many [men] won't come to the hospital because we have social restrictions in place,"" Margareta Kitlinski, a senior consultant at the Centre of Reproductive Medicine at the Skane University Hospital in Malmo, told Euronews on Thursday.

""So, over the last three months we have had to take a pulse and [right now], we don't do any IVF treatment with donor sperms because we simply don't have any,"" she said.

In the midst of the pandemic, Kitlinski said her own clinic has seen its wait times for assisted pregnancy treatments double due to the lack of sperm donations.

""If I compare the figures from two years ago, the waiting list was three months to one year maximum and now we have a waiting list for two years,"" she said. ""I do think the last year has doubled the waiting list.""

Kitlinski said Gothenburg's University Hospital was experiencing a similar shortage, with Stockholm likely to follow.

Indeed, in an interview with Reuters, which first reported on the issue, Ann Thurin Kjellberg, who leads the reproduction unit at Gothenburg's University Hospital, said the clinic was ""running out of sperm"".

""We've never had so few donors as during the last year,"" she said.

Kitlinski did say that public reproduction units in Sweden have seen donor numbers dip in recent years due to the rise of private fertility clinics in the country.

What many donors may not realise, she said, is that they will be paid the same amount of money whether they choose to attend a public or private clinic.

Those seeking assisted pregnancy treatments, however, will have to pay a hefty sum to private fertility clinics, whereas public treatment is free.

At a private clinic, the treatment can cost up to 100,000 Swedish crowns (€9,874), making it inaccessible to many across the country.

According to the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology, Sweden is among the countries with the highest assisted conception rates in the world.

However, the country also has strict policies around sperm donations, with a sperm sample only eligible to be used by a maximum of six women.

Kitlinski said she hopes that more potential donors will come forward over the months ahead.

But with Sweden grappling with a major surge in coronavirus cases over recent weeks, it could take some time before donations begin to pick up again.

On Wednesday, the country recorded 8,879 new COVID-19 cases and 60 deaths within a 24-hour period, bringing its total number of coronavirus cases up to 885,385 and its death toll up to 13,720, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Since the pandemic began last year, Sweden has resisted implementing strict lockdown measures, instead opting to keep the economy largely open and impose less severe restrictions.",509,3123,8,48

China poses the single biggest geopolitical test for the United States in the 21st century, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director William Burns has said, stressing that this threat is more serious than those from Russia during the Cold War.

Mr. Burns made the remarks to members of the House Select Committee on Intelligence during a Congressional hearing on worldwide threats on Thursday.

“I think China poses the single biggest geopolitical test for the United States as far out into the 21st century as I can see,” Burns said.

“What distinguishes that challenge from an increasingly adversarial Chinese Communist Party from, for example, the challenge we faced with the Soviet Union during the Cold War, is that this challenge unfolds across a whole range of areas from military to ideological in terms of our values, economic and especially at its core competition and technology as well,” Burns said.

The U.S. and China are at odds over a range of issues from trade to human rights in Tibet, Hong Kong and China's western Xinjiang region, as well as over Taiwan, Beijing's assertiveness in the South China Sea and the coronavirus pandemic.

Responding to a question from Senator Peter Welch, Burns said that certainly, there are going to be some areas where it's in their mutual self-interest to work together. Climate change and nuclear nonproliferation are a few of those areas.

But there are an increasing and growing number of areas in which China poses a real challenge, he said.

During the hearing Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, the only Indian-American in the House Intelligence Committee, said China possesses substantial cyber-attack capabilities that have been identified with localised infrastructure disruptions in different countries, for instance, following the clashes between China and India on the Line of Actual Control.

“Recently, in the fall, there was a temporary blackout in Mumbai that folks may have associated with Chinese-based entities. Can you guarantee to us that the Chinese government cannot do to any city here what they may have done in other places on the earth?” he asked.

Congressman Adam Schiff, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee said that China and Russia have different capabilities and intentions, but both seek to challenge and disrupt and supplant the liberal democratic order built by the United States.

“We face challenges from these two nations across all domains, some of them very immediate, with Russia mobilising its forces along the border with Ukraine and China taking aggressive actions towards Taiwan. And we must confront persistent threats from nations like North Korea and Iran,” he said.

An executive order issued by President Joe Biden this morning makes clear that the United States will no longer sit on its hands in the face of Russian aggression, Schiff said.",491,3083,14,88

Britain stands in ""full support"" of the Czech Republic which foreign minister Dominic Raab said on Sunday had exposed the lengths Russian intelligence services will go to after Prague accused Moscow of involvement in an ammunition depot explosion.

Czech police said on Saturday they were searching for two men in connection with serious criminal activity carrying Russian passports in the names of Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, and that the men were in the country in days leading up to the blast at the Czech depot in 2014.

Those were the aliases used by two Russian military intelligence (GRU) officers who British prosecutors charged with the attempted poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia with the nerve agent Novichok in 2018. Moscow denied involvement in that incident.

""The UK stands in full support of our Czech allies, who have exposed the lengths that the GRU will go to in their attempts to conduct dangerous and malign operations – and highlights a disturbing pattern of behaviour following the attack in Salisbury,"" Raab said on Twitter.

Ties between Britain and Russia have plunged to post-Cold War lows, with London calling the country ""the most acute threat to our security"" in the Euro-Atlantic region in its foreign and defence policy statement last month.

In an interview conducted for the Andrew Marr Show on Friday, Russian Ambassador Andrei Kelin said he had not seen Raab for more than a year.

""In the recent year our relations have become worse..., even worse,"" Kelin said in the interview, which aired on Sunday.

He said, however, that sanctions alone are not sufficient.

In an interview with ""Face The Nation"" moderator Margaret Brennan, Macron said he ""fully"" shares Mr. Biden's desire to open dialogue with Russia. However, he said it was important to be clear with Putin ""when we are not aligned.""

""This is the only way to be credible. I think that sanctions are not sufficient in itself, in themselves, but sanctions are part of the package. I do prefer constructive dialogue, but to have a constructive and efficient dialogue, you need credibility,"" Macron said.

Over 30,000 Russian soldiers are amassed on the border of Ukraine, raising concerns that Russia may invade. This is the highest number of Russian troops gathered on the border since 2014. Macron is aligned with President Biden's view that this is an unacceptable level of tension.

""I think we have to define clear red lines with Russia,"" in order to be credible, Macron said. He acknowledged that the international community has had what he called a ""naive approach"" with Russia.

""I think what happened a few years ago when Ukraine was invaded, it's not a failure of diplomacy, it's a failure of our collective credibility vis-à-vis Russia,"" Macron said in reference to the international community's failure to enforce the Obama-Biden administration's ""red line"" on the use of chemical weapons by Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad in 2013. That inaction, in Macron's view, emboldened Mr. Putin.

Months later, Russia annexed Crimea, a peninsula jutting out into the Black Sea, away from Ukraine in 2014. The annexation was widely condemned by the international community, and the U.S. sanctioned Russia in response.

On Thursday, Mr. Biden announced more sanctions against Russia this week in retaliation for espionage and political interference, citing both the SolarWinds cyber hacking and Moscow's interference in the 2020 US presidential election.

""We cannot allow a foreign power to interfere in our democratic process with impunity,"" Mr. Biden said in remarks announcing the sanctions on Thursday, although he added that ""now is the time to de-escalate.""

According to a White House readout of their Tuesday phone call, President Biden also called on Vladimir Putin to ""de-escalate tensions"" surrounding the Russian military buildup in ""occupied Crimea and on Ukraine's borders.""

0,First-ever human-monkey hybrid created in ‘chimera’ embryo experiment,http://globalnews.ca/news/7760167/human-monkey-chimera-embryo-hybrid/,"Scientists have successfully combined human and monkey cells into a single living, growing embryo, in a major — and ethically complex — breakthrough for organ transplant research.

But don’t worry: This isn’t the real-world prequel to a planet of the semi-human apes. At least, not yet.

An international team of researchers added human stem cells to macaque monkey embryos and watched as they survived and multiplied as one, according to the findings published Thursday in the journal Cell. The scientists effectively created genetic chimeras — a term borrowed from the mythical monster to describe one organism with genes from multiple individuals.

Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, a professor at the Salk Institute and co-author on the study, insists that this is not about creating a full-grown chimera with human and animal traits.

“Our goal is not to generate any new organism, any monster,” he told NPR. “And we are not doing anything like that. We are trying to understand how cells from different organisms communicate with one another.”

He adds that the discovery could lead to better understanding of human biology and diseases, as well as more effective human chimeras involving less similar species. That, perhaps, could lead to animals being used to grow organs for human transplant.

Belmonte and his team injected 25 human stem cells into macaque embryos taken six days after fertilization. Human cells were found growing inside 132 of the embryos after one day, and 103 chimeras were still alive after Day 10. Nearly all had died by Day 19, and the rest were destroyed on Day 20.

“On average we observed around 4 per cent of human cells in the monkey epiblast,” co-author Dr. Jun Wu, at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, told The Guardian.

“We demonstrated that the human stem cells survived and generated additional cells, as would happen normally as primate embryos develop and form the layers of cells that eventually lead to all of an animal’s organs,” Belmonte said.

The successful experiment was a major step forward for Belmonte, who has studied this area for decades and who has previously tried to combine human and pig cells in the same manner.

The breakthrough is part of a broader effort to see if animals can be used to grow human organs for transplant patients — a goal that others have also chased by trying to splice human DNA into pigs, mice and sheep. Chinese researchers have also created pig-monkey chimeras with the same end goal in mind.

Belmonte says these revelations about cell communication will hopefully make it easier to create chimeras out of more genetically distant species, such as humans and pigs, in the future.

Of course, the breakthrough also opens up a slew of difficult ethical questions.

“My first question is: Why?” Kirstin Matthews, a fellow for science and technology at Rice University’s Baker Institute, told NPR. “I think the public is going to be concerned, and I am as well, that we’re just pushing forward with science without having a proper conversation about what we should or should not do.”

Professor Julian Savulescu, the director of the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics and co-director of the Wellcome Centre for Ethics and Humanities at the University of Oxford, also raised concerns about this discovery becoming a slippery slope.

“These embryos were destroyed at 20 days of development, but it is only a matter of time before human-nonhuman chimeras are successfully developed, perhaps as a source of organs for humans,” he told The Guardian.

He added that any fully-grown chimera involving human cells would need to be thoroughly assessed to see what its mental capacity is like, especially if it’s to be used for organ transplants.

“What looks like a nonhuman animal may mentally be close to a human,” he said. “We will need new ways to understand animals, their mental lives and relationships before they are used for human benefit.”

The embryos in this experiment had not progressed to the point where they were forming body parts or brain cells.

Belmonte says the next step is to better understand the communication pathways between cells, and to determine which ones are critical for an embryo’s development.

He adds that he and his team performed “ethical consultations and reviews” before they made their chimeras, with help from unaffiliated bioethicists.

0,Hezbollah prepares parallel state in Lebanon using food weapon,https://jpost.com/middle-east/hezbollah-prepares-parallel-state-in-lebanon-using-food-weapon-665431,"‘To be able to shop in these supermarkets, you have to have a card issued by Hezbollah,” said a Hezbollah official, who asked not to be named in a recent France24 report on Lebanon. A few paragraphs later the official clarified his point, “anyone in need can shop with us, regardless of their religious affiliation and even if they are not Hezbollah supporters,” an official told France 24.

What that means is that Lebanese who shop at Hezbollah, an armed terrorist group that also has a political wing and seeks to control Lebanon and use it as a base of operations in the region, is now creating new facts on the ground for its parallel economy. As Lebanon’s economy has faltered, Hezbollah has sought to thrive, strangling Lebanon and increasingly digesting the country. Out of that digestion comes a new chain of supermarkets controlled by the extra-paramilitary armed group. It sells “Syrian, Iraqi and Iranian products at reduced prices that are accessible with a party-issued card,” the report says.What that means is that Lebanese who shop at Hezbollah’s markets can buy from other Iranian-occupied countries. In short, Hezbollah now owns a country called Lebanon and is outsourcing Iranian products to it so Hezbollah and Iran can profit. The more Lebanon falls apart, the greater Hezbollah becomes.

This situation was largely created, or at least tolerated, by the international community that rubber-stamped the idea that Lebanon would have a parallel armed state unlike any other country in the world. No other country has members of parliament from an illegal armed militia that does not answer to the state. Only Lebanon, recipient of US aid and western largesse, has such a situation. Hezbollah was once a smaller sectarian movement that thrived off claiming it was “resisting” Israel. When Israel left it occupied southern Lebanon and didn’t hand over its weapons, even though other armed militias had been demobilized by the Taif agreement in 1989. After the 2006 war that Hezbollah brought on Lebanon by attacking Israel it grew in importance, using its power over reconstruction funds to build up apartments.

Hezbollah has created parallel construction and development entities such Jihad Al-Binaa and the Waad project, its own communications network, TV stations and radio communications networks. It has taken over healthcare, education, welfare and finance in parts of the country. Further information on this can be found at the 2010 report at the Congressional Research Service on Hezbollah’s background by Casey Addis and Christopher Blanchard.

Hezbollah even undertook projects like providing drinking water for parts of Lebanon, claiming this was part of its “resistance” against Israel. In short it got the government to outsource part of government responsibilities to Hezbollah and then it had an iron grip on the country. It even put its own fiber optic communications network to use to bypass the government. Any attempt to stop the takeover is met with Hezbollah violence. Hezbollah attacked adversaires and took over part of the country in 2008 when opposition in the government sought to crack down on the military communication network in the country. Hezbollah coordinated the killing of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri in 2005 using that network.

Now Hezbollah wants the fruits and vegetables too. France24 says this is a “welcome initiative in a country crippled by a financial crisis and food shortages. But critics say it’s yet another bid by the powerful Shiite movement to win loyalty by providing services in a weak state and oversee a parallel economy.”

cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });

if(window.location.pathname.indexOf(""656089"") != -1){console.log(""hedva connatix"");document.getElementsByClassName(""divConnatix"")[0].style.display =""none"";}

Hezbollah exploited the country’s economic failures and food shortage by opening the new supermarkets. “Food in Lebanon is not just overpriced but often impossible to find,” France24. Now Al-Sajjad supermarkets provide cheaper goods but you need a special card and you have to prove you don’t earn much money. “Anyone in need can shop with us, regardless of their religious affiliation and even if they are not Hezbollah supporters,” the Hezbollah official told France24.

The report notes that Hezbollah has been accused of smuggling the goods over the border, stocking shelves by preying on Syria and Iraq. Only 8,000 people so far have supposedly joined the new Hezbollah supermarket membership chain, which acts like a Costco, if Costo was run by an American religious armed militia with members in Congress.

How does it work if you want to shop at Hezbollah’s market? According to the report you may apply but then a Hezbollah party member comes to give you the card. People are apparently so afraid they asked France24 to change their names for the article. “The stores look like large depots and are always fully stocked. I was able to buy milk, rice, sugar and vegetable oil at reduced prices,” one person told the reporters.

Other Islamist groups have used food as a weapon. Pro-Turkey groups would stock warehouses near Kilis during the Syrian civil war and bring it across to displaced people. It is unclear if they distributed it only to their supporters. Food was used as a weapon in Somalia in the 1990s and other conflicts.

According to the report the Al-Sajjad card means a person can get rive, sugar, cooking oil and some other basic products. One teacher said “he had been approached by Hezbollah members from his village who offered to give him an Al-Sajjad card.” With the card he can get health care too. Critics have pointed out that this illustrates how the state no longer exists in Lebanon.

But is Hezbollah only maintaining stability in its Shi’ite areas or using food as a weapon now. “The party sees itself as a victim of a plot hatched against it by the United States, to bring it to its knees,” one person told France24. “It’s responding by ensuring that its public doesn’t go hungry by securing its own supply channels through Iran, Syria or Iraq.”

That seems like it is benefiting Iran, much as Iran subverted Iraq’s economy, destroyed part of Iraq and holds it hostage through armed groups. Iran does the same thing to Yemen. It holes out the country, creates a parallel militia state and then makes everyone go through that parallel state for services, eroding the real institutions. Western governments tend to try to prop up state institutions by arguing this will balance Hezbollah in Lebanon, but that has the affect of only empowering Hezbollah and legitimizing it by enabling the weakened state to limp along while Hezbollah increasingly creates a new, more powerful Hezbollah-state, next to the ruins of the old state.",1094,6870,9,62

The Czech authorities said on Saturday they were seeking Alexander Petrov, 41, and Ruslan Boshirov, 43, in connection with a previously unexplained 2014 explosion at a munitions dump in Vrbětice, which left two dead.

The duo are believed to be Russian GRU officers – real names Alexander Mishkin and Anatoliy Chepiga. They entered the UK under the names of Petrov and Boshirov in the run-up to the poisoning of former GRU officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, and were also present on Czech territory in October 2014, when the explosion occurred.

Raab praised the Czechs, who had “exposed the lengths that the Russian intelligence services will go to in their attempts to conduct dangerous and malign operations in Europe” – and hinted that he believed the same GRU cell was behind both plots.

“This shows a pattern of behaviour by Moscow, following the novichok attack in Salisbury,” Raab added. “We are as determined and committed as ever to bring those responsible for the attack in Salisbury to justice, and commend the actions of the Czech authorities to do the same.”

Western intelligence sources are confident that the Czech authorities’ investigation is well-founded, and argue that it demonstrates growing evidence of the activities of the 29155 GRU unit, specialising in deadly undercover operations across Europe.

Since the election of Joe Biden as US president, the west has become increasingly loud in calling out Russian spy plots. Last week, the US announced the expulsion of 10 Russian diplomats and alongside the UK accused the Kremlin of being behind the the SolarWinds cyberattack.

According to Czech media, detectives investigating the explosion initially assumed it was a tragic accident. Two men working at the depot – Vratislav Havránek and Luděk Petřík – died instantly when 50 tonnes of ammunition blew up.

Last year, however, investigators from Prague’s counter-intelligence service and the national centre against organised crime received new information. They discovered Mishkin and Chepiga – using the Petrov and Boshirov passports – had been in the country when the explosion took place.

The pair flew in from Moscow on 11 October 2014 on a regular Aeroflot flight. They left five days later – the day of the explosion – and went home via Austria. They emailed the depot in advance to arrange a visit and booked into a hotel in the nearby city of Ostrava.

The GRU officers sent scanned passports to depot managers issued in two further names – Ruslan Tabarov from Tajikistan and Nicolaj Popa from Moldova. Unusually, their email contained no metadata. The photos matched Chepiga and Mishkin.

Police believe the undercover GRU officers visited the arms complex. They have been unable to prove this since all evidence was destroyed. At the time weapons were being unloaded for a delivery to a Bulgarian arms dealer, Emilian Gebrev, who was supplying them to the Ukrainian army.

One source told the Czech magazine Respekt that the explosion in the warehouse may have happened prematurely. “It was probably not meant to take place in the Czech Republic, but only later during the transport of weapons to another country,” the source said.

Gebrev was poisoned in May 2015 after going for dinner in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia. Bulgarian prosecutors claim three undercover GRU operatives had checked into a hotel overlooking Gebrev’s office. One of them was Sergei Fedotov – real name Denis Sergeev – who flew to London at the time of the Salisbury poisonings.

Western intelligence has suspected the same GRU unit of being involved in the poisoning of Gebrev for some time, although the link to the explosion is new. It also believes members of unit 29155 were involved in a failed coup in Montenegro in 2016 and disinformation operations in Moldova in 2014.

Around 15 to 20 elite GRU officers are thought to make up the unit, which has a secret HQ in the Skhodnya area of Moscow. It functioned as a diversionary cell, sent deep behind enemy lines, with a base in south-east France, close to the Swiss border. After Salisbury, it appears to have been disbanded.

On Saturday the Czech government kicked out 18 Russian diplomats from Moscow’s embassy in Prague. It said it would brief its Nato counterparts at a meeting this week, amid signals that it plans to take a much tougher line over the Kremlin’s regular espionage activities.

Russia dismissed accusations that it was behind the 2014 depot explosion as unfounded and absurd. It said it would retaliate for the moves against its embassy staff and on Sunday announced the expulsion of 20 Czech diplomats. It accused Prague of trying to ingratiate itself with Washington by carrying out provocative “anti-Russian actions”.

Moscow also denies the GRU was involved in the attempted murders of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. The two men known as Petrov and Boshirov said in a television interview that their visit to Britain in 2018 was innocent.

They told the Russian TV network RT they were only in Salisbury as tourists to visit the cathedral, which they described as “famous for its 123-metre spire”. If they visited the site of the poisoning, it was a coincidence, they said.

Quick Guide What is novichok? Show Novichok refers to a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 80s to elude international restrictions on chemical weapons. Like other nerve agents, they are organophosphate compounds, but the chemicals used to make them, and their final structures, are considered classified in the UK, the US and other countries. The most potent of the novichok substances are considered to be more lethal than VX, the most deadly of the familiar nerve agents, which include sarin, tabun and soman. Novichok agents work in a similar way, by massively over-stimulating muscles and glands. Treatment for novichok exposure would be the same as for other nerve agents, namely with atropine, diazepam and potentially drugs called oximes. The chemical structures of novichok agents were made public in 2008 by Vil Mirzayanov, a former Russian scientist living in the US, but the structures have never been publicly confirmed. It is thought they can be made in different forms, including as a dust aerosol. The novichoks are known as binary agents because they only become lethal after mixing two otherwise harmless components. According to Mirzayanov, they are 10 to 100 times more toxic than conventional nerve agents. Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images Europe

The open-source website Bellingcat revealed Chepiga and Mishkin’s real identities and also discovered they had both been made “heroes of Russia”. Mishkin’s grandmother told neighbours she had a photo of him collecting his award and shaking hands with Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin.

It had been thought the decoration was in recognition for Mishkin and Chepiga’s secret work in Ukraine and Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014 in a shadowy military operation. It now appears the award may have been connected to the Czech warehouse explosion.

The Skripals suddenly fell ill in March 2018, with international investigations confirming they had been poisoned with the novichok nerve agent made by Russia.

The Skripals survived the attack, but a British woman, Dawn Sturgess, died after her partner picked up the discarded, modified perfume bottle in which the poison was hidden and gave it to her mistakenly as a gift.

Britain has brought a series of charges against the men known as Petrov and Boshirov in relation to the case and an Interpol red notice is outstanding against the two men, requiring other countries to arrest them should they leave Russia.",1292,7919,10,63

The identity of the triangle- or pyramid-shaped aerial objects remains a mystery. The Defense Department isn’t sharing what it knows.

The photos and videos were first published by the Mystery Wire and Extraordinary Beliefs websites. The objects were photographed zipping over the USS Russell off San Diego in July 2019, according to investigative filmmaker Jeremy Corbell.

Photos of three unidentified flying objects reportedly taken in March that year — one spherical, another “acorn” shaped, and one described as a “metallic blimp” — were also taken by Navy personnel, Pentagon spokesperson Susan Gough told CNN.

Mystery Wire’s George Knapp reported that those objects were photographed off Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia by an F-18 weapons systems officer seated behind the pilot, who used his iPhone.

Gough offered no details on either of the sightings.

“To maintain operations security and to avoid disclosing information that may be useful to potential adversaries, the Department of Defense does not discuss publicly the details of either the observations or the examinations of reported incursions into our training ranges or designated airspace — including those incursions initially designated as UAP,” Gough told CNN, using the abbreviation for Unidentified Aerial Phenomena.

A new Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force, created last August to investigate such sightings by the military, has “included these incidents in their ongoing examinations,” Gough said.

When questioned by reporters last week, Chief of Naval Operations Michael Gilday couldn’t explain the objects.

1,Local Jew Feels Left Out Of Worldwide Jewish Conspiracy,https://local.theonion.com/local-jew-feels-left-out-of-worldwide-jewish-conspiracy-1819564292,"SOUTHFIELD, MI—It is an hour past sunset on a brisk Thursday night, and, like their brethren around the globe, the Jews of this affluent Detroit suburb are gathered in synagogues, busily hatching plots for world domination through financial chicanery and media influence. But for Seth Nussbaum, it will be just another lonely evening.

""For some reason, they've decided to leave me out of the worldwide Jewish conspiracy,"" said Nussbaum, a 34-year-old computer programmer. ""And I can't say it doesn't hurt.""

While his fellow Jews are controlling the flow of billions of dollars of international currency and brokering multi million-dollar entertainment deals, on this quiet night Nussbaum is making himself a frozen pizza and watching ER, far removed from any money beyond the $28,000 annual salary he receives from his job at Cyntech Industries.

""Who's to say I wouldn't enjoy hoarding a little gold every now and then?"" he said, his voice tinged with bitterness. ""Believe me, I'd love to be able to sneak around behind the scenes like the Elders of Zion, pulling the strings and holding the real power in society. But I guess when it comes to working the Jerusalem-New York-L.A. triangle, I just wasn't one of the chosen people.""

Unlike millions of other Jews around the world, Nussbaum holds no sway over the media, has no powerful friends within the Wall Street banking community or the Trilateral Commission, and has never run a major Hollywood studio.

Though its influence stretches to all corners of the globe, the worldwide Jewish conspiracy has, for mysterious reasons, neglected to include Southfield, MI, computer programmer Seth Nussbaum.

In fact, Nussbaum doesn't even own so much as his own production company. ""Spielberg, Geffen, Ovitz, Eisner, Katzenberg—those are the Jews who control Hollywood,"" Nussbaum said. ""And there's countless other Jews calling the shots at every level of the entertainment industry, from agents to producers to directors. But me? I probably couldn't even get the studio backing for a $15 to $20 million romantic comedy with a mid-level star like Matthew Broderick.""

And despite being a regular subscriber to The New York Times for seven years, Nussbaum has no powerful connections among the Jews who own that and every other newspaper in the United States.

""As a left-leaning Jew, I should enjoy vast influence over the press. I should be able use the papers and television stations I own to forward my biased, liberal Jewish agenda and get Israel-supporting Democratic candidates elected to Congress,"" said Nussbaum, sitting on the old futon he uses as a couch. ""But somehow, that's just not the case.""

Spurned by his own kind, Nussbaum has not even been able to gain admittance into a secondary world-domination conspiracy like the Masons. ""They turned down my application,"" he said, sighing deeply, ""when they found out I was Jewish. I guess for now I'll just have to resign myself to being Seth Nussbaum, computer programmer and powerless Jew.""",490,3055,9,55
0,Magnitude 5.9 earthquake strikes southwestern Iran,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/magnitude-59-earthquake-strikes-southwestern-iran-77147327,"A magnitude 5.9 earthquake has shaken southwestern Iran along the Persian Gulf

TEHRAN, Iran -- A magnitude 5.9 earthquake shook southwestern Iran along the Persian Gulf on Sunday, followed by over a dozen aftershocks, state TV reported.

At least five people were injured, Iran's state-run IRNA news agency reported.

State TV shared mobile phone pictures of cracked and collapsed walls in the area of the port city of Bandar Genaveh, the temblor's epicenter. People rushed into the streets of the city as the quakes struck, IRNA said.

Video shot by a bystander at an industrial site near Bandar Genaveh appeared to show landslides in nearby foothills. Iranian media widely rebroadcast the footage.

Three aftershocks of magnitude 4 followed the initial quake, the report said, as well as other weaker ones.

Iran's senior Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri, in a phone call with the Bushehr provincial governor, called for the immediate care of quake victims, the semiofficial ISNA news agency reported.

The U.S. Geological Survey called the initial temblor a 5.8 magnitude earthquake. It said its depth was 10 kilometers (6.2 miles).

A magnitude 5 earthquake can cause considerable damage. Such shallow earthquakes as Sunday's also can result in broader damage.

The quake was some 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant.

ISNA quoted an official at the nuclear power plant saying the quake caused no damage and there were no disruptions in the plant's operations. The facility was constructed to withstand earthquakes up to magnitude 8.

Iran is on major seismic faults and experiences one earthquake a day on average. In 2003, a magnitude 6.6 earthquake flattened the historic city of Bam, killing 26,000 people.

A magnitude 7 earthquake that struck western Iran in 2017 killed more than 600 people and injured more than 9,000.",297,1859,6,50

0,Opinion | Justin Trudeau is about to set an ambitious new target for greenhouse gas reduction. Canada seems ready for the challenge,https://www.thestar.com/politics/political-opinion/2021/04/14/justin-trudeau-is-about-to-set-an-ambitious-new-target-for-greenhouse-gas-reduction-canada-seems-ready-for-the-challenge.html,"The federal Liberals are poised to commit to cutting greenhouse gas emissions by more than 40 per cent by 2030, the Star has learned — a major ramping up of their climate ambition as the politics around their current target heats up.

That’s easier said than done — especially since Canada has managed to lower emissions by just one per cent over the past 15 years.

But taken together with the Conservatives’ new climate plan and surging investment into clean energy, it’s one more sign that Canada and Canadian voters are ready for fundamental changes to how our economy and our energy consumption work.

A Liberal commitment to surpass 40 per cent is aggressive. It takes the federal ambition beyond Stephen Harper’s 30-per-cent target of old, and it’s in the realm of what’s considered necessary to ensure global warming over the long term is held to just 1.5 C.

And it will set the cat among the political pigeons now that the Conservatives — after months of existential angst — have just laid out a plan for the 30 per cent target.

Under pressure from the White House in advance of U.S. President Joe Biden’s climate summit set for next week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is set to announce the new target some time after Monday’s federal budget or perhaps at the summit itself.

Biden is thinking big — in terms of money the U.S. is willing to spend, in terms of how steeply the U.S. wants to cut emissions, and in terms of what it wants its allies to do alongside it. And Trudeau, it seems, is all ears.

The problem, as both the Liberals and the Conservatives know, is how to actually achieve those emission reductions.

Under both Trudeau and Harper, Canada had promised to cut emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, but neither of their parties had put in place a credible plan that set the country on a path to reach that target until recently.

The Liberals laid out a detailed, fully funded plan to get there in December. It ratcheted up the carbon price for consumers, earmarked $15 billion in low-carbon initiatives, another $15 billion in public transit funding, and set out details to cut emissions by at least 31 per cent by 2030.

As they said at the time, if all the stars align, the plan should be able to deliver a reduction of between 32 and 40 per cent.

Now, the stars are actually aligning. With Biden fully engaged on climate change, Canada has a hope of working with the United States to reduce methane emissions for oil and gas production, and to harmonize fuel efficiency regulations for new cars.

“It certainly makes it a lot easier,” Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson told the Toronto Star’s Alex Ballingall earlier this week. “It just works so much better from an economic perspective, if we can actually have common approaches (to) common targets.”

To surpass a 40 per cent reduction in emissions, however, the federal government will need more than compatibility with the Americans and a carbon tax aimed at consumers.

In Ottawa’s latest analysis of where emissions come from, released just this week, we can see that there are three sectors that make up the lion’s share of our emissions and where emissions are also on the rise: oil and gas, transport and buildings.

So meeting our new target will mean a laserlike focus on what we produce, what we drive, where we live and where we work. That means government spending to support innovation, a massive switch to electric vehicles, and retrofitting of buildings across the country. It also means financing for a hydrogen strategy as well as carbon capture and storage.

And it means collaborating closely with the private sector so that companies can shift their production to clean energy and low-carbon processes. In a position paper published on Thursday, the Business Council of Canada, the lobby group representing Canada’s biggest companies, said it was ready, willing and able to work with government to comply with carbon pricing, reduce emissions and fully embrace sustainable finance.

Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading...

But it also implies lifestyle changes for regular Canadians — some hard choices about our energy consumption, our driving and commuting habits, and our willingness to learn new skills in a changing workforce.

Are we ready for this? Say what you will about the stringency and credibility of the new Conservative plan on climate; the fact that Erin O’Toole has finally now proposed a carbon levy of his own, embraced clean fuel standards and seems to adopt the Liberal price on carbon for large emitters suggests a recognition that voters are indeed ready.

If we can pull this off, the next generation just might thank us.

Article content The federal government is considering a controversial move to allow internet service providers to block websites that show pirated movies and TV shows. The government launched a consultation document Wednesday that proposes a number of options to crack down on online content that infringes copyright in Canada. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Try refreshing your browser, or Canada is considering a proposal that would allow internet providers to block piracy websites Back to video “This is something you can safely say is going to receive a lot of pushback,” said Laura Tribe, executive director of internet advocacy group OpenMedia. According to a 2018 government report, pirated content is accessed by 26 per cent of online Canadians. And when a website-blocking proposal was unsuccessfully floated three years ago thousands of Canadians complained to the CRTC that it was an attack on net neutrality and free expression. The goal of the consultation is to ensure that those who hold the rights to the content “are able to obtain fair remuneration for protected uses of their content online,” the paper outlined. Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault said in a press release the Canada needs “a more up-to-date framework to ensure more accountability and better remuneration and transparency.”

Article content Innovation Minister Philippe-François Champagne said in the release the consultation aims to “strike the balance between facilitating broad, lawful access to copyright-protected content, and safeguarding individual rights and freedoms in an open Internet.” The government launched the consultation “to hear the diverse perspectives of stakeholders, from online intermediaries to those holding copyrights, as well as any Canadian who wants to share input,” he said. More On This Topic Massive Facebook data breach affecting millions of Canadians was not reported to federal privacy watchdog Promises to reduce wireless bills could haunt Liberals if Rogers-Shaw merger becomes campaign issue Options the government is considering include requiring intermediaries, a category that includes internet service providers and online platforms, to block access to infringing content, or limit, suspend or terminate access to their services for infringers. It suggested both implementing a court process that would oversee such actions, and “notification and action mechanisms” in which decisions would be “made according to the intermediary’s judgment rather than required” by legislation.

Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Article content “This is internet policy being pushed by broadcast interests,” and a conflict of interest that will lead to overreach, Tribe said. That’s because some of Canada’s biggest internet providers are vertically integrated companies whose media divisions are rightsholders to content. “If you look at a company like Bell, they are predisposed to believe something is a violation of copyright if it is their copyright they think is being violated,” she said. She added that the fundamental principle of net neutrality “is that these are supposed to be common carriers. They’re supposed to carry all content equally until it is proven to be illegal.” Having companies decide what is good and bad, “is very different, particularly when they have such conflicted business interests,” Tribe said. A website-blocking proposal was put forward three years ago when a coalition of broadcasters and groups representing the production sector asked the CRTC to implement a regime that would block access to infringing content. The “FairPlay” coalition included the media divisions of vertically integrated companies that are also ISPs and TV service providers, including Bell, Rogers and Quebecor. It estimated the cost of piracy to TV providers amounted to $500 million a year, lowering their contributions to production of Canadian content by between $11 million and $25 million annually.

Article content The application drew strong opposition from internet advocates and many Canadians, about 141,000 of whom signed petitions against the proposal, which the CRTC ultimately concluded wasn’t in its jurisdiction. Photo by Brent Lewin/Bloomberg The consultation document released by the government Wednesday suggested implementing a court process that could result in orders to block websites or remove them from search engine results, orders to remove content and orders to “limit, suspend or terminate access” to service. The court would be available “in at least certain cases” without first having to obtain a judgment from the court against those infringing content and without having to include them as a party in the court proceeding. In 2019, Federal Court ordered ISPs to block a copyright infringing site, GoldTV, for the first time. That decision is currently in appeal. The consultation document also outlines ways legislation could put more responsibility on intermediaries to be aware of and fight such content. Intermediates are currently subject to “safe harbour” protections from liability in cases where they “merely provide the technical means by which others infringe copyright.”

Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Article content The consultation paper proposed changes to those protections, by “compelling greater vigilance of intermediaries against potential infringements facilitated by their services.” It also suggested imposing additional obligations on intermediaries “either as conditions on their safe harbour protections or standalone measures.” Those obligations could include requirements to take down content or cut off the infringer’s access to the intermediary’s service, it suggested, with intermediaries making the call whether to take such actions. Such mechanisms would have to be documented, and “easily accessible and understandable,” it said. Carleton University professor Dwayne Winseck said in an interview that putting obligations on ISPs to prevent or stop infringement is “fraught with difficulties” because it leaves them as the “judge, jury and executioner.” He added that the involvement of vertically integrated companies “in which one division of the shop would be reporting a possible infringing site to another division with the same shop, recommending that it be blocked, is hugely problematic.”

Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Article content Another option suggested by the paper is a new compulsory licensing scheme in which intermediaries like social media platforms would pay royalties to rightsholders, which would apply to large, for-profit online platforms that host user-uploaded content. University of Ottawa law professor Michael Geist said in an email that the “proposal to effectively tax online content through yet more collective licensing is misguided.” He said calling for government-backed licensing systems “might be good for lawyers, but will harm innovation, provide little to creators, and ultimately reduce choice for the public.”

Shopping malls, gyms, dine-out service at restaurants and some weekly markets will be shut during the weekend and only essential services would remain operational, Mr Kejriwal said.

India reported a record 200,000 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday and the financial hub of Mumbai entered a lockdown, as many hospitals treating coronavirus patients reported severe shortages of beds and oxygen supplies.

The surge was the seventh record daily increase in the last eight days and comes as India battles a massive second wave of infections that has its epicentre in the economically significant state of Maharashtra, home to Mumbai. The western state accounts for about a quarter of the country's total cases.

India reported 200,739 Covid-19 cases over the last 24 hours, according to Health Ministry data released on Thursday.

Deaths stood at 1,038, taking the total to 173,123.

The total caseload reached 14.1 million, second only to the United States, which leads the global tally with 31.4 million cases.

Hospitals and doctors in Maharashtra as well as other regions, including Gujarat and Delhi in the north, reported chaotic scenes as healthcare facilities were overwhelmed with a surge in admissions of Covid-19 patients.

""The situation is horrible. We are a 900-bed hospital, but there are about 60 patients waiting and we don't have space for them,"" said Dr Avinash Gawande, an official at the Government Medical College and Hospital in Nagpur, a commercial hub in Maharashtra.

Hospitals in other places including Gujarat, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state, reported oxygen shortages.

""If such conditions persist, the death toll will rise,"" the head of a medical body in Ahmedabad wrote in a letter to the Gujarat state chief minister.

India's government said the country was producing oxygen at its full capacity everyday for the last two days and it had boosted output.

""Along with the ramped up production of the oxygen manufacturing units and the surplus stocks available, the present availability of oxygen is sufficient,"" the Health Ministry said in a statement on Thursday.

Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of pilgrims still thronged to a religious festival in the north of the country on Wednesday, stoking fears of a new surge in Covid-19 cases in the region.

In capital Delhi, too, daily Covid-19 cases are hitting new records, with doctors warning the surge could be deadlier than in 2020.

""This virus is more infectious and virulent... We have 35-year olds with pneumonia in intensive care, which was not happening last year,"" said Dr Dhiren Gupta, a paediatrician at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in New Delhi. ""The situation is chaotic.""",458,2882,39,249

CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Alex White thought he was watching a huge worm writhing in plastic-wrapped lettuce he’d just brought home from a Sydney supermarket — until a snake tongue flicked.

“I kind of completely freaked out when I saw this little tongue come out of its mouth and start flicking around and realized it was a snake because worms don’t have tongues,” White said on Thursday.

“I definitely kind of panicked a bit,” he added.

It was a venomous pale-headed snake that authorities say made an 870-kilometer (540-mile) journey to Sydney from a packing plant in the Australian city of Toowoomba wrapped in plastic with two heads of cos lettuce.

The refrigerated supermarket supply chain likely lulled the cold-blooded juvenile into a stupor until White bought the lettuce at an ALDI supermarket on Monday evening and rode his bicycle home with salad and snake in his backpack.

White and his partner Amelia Neate spotted the snake moving as soon as the lettuce was unpacked onto the kitchen table.

They also noticed the plastic wrapping was torn and that the snake could escape, so they quickly stuffed the reptile with the lettuce into a plastic food storage container.

White phoned the WIRES rescue organization and a snake handler took the snake away that night.

Before the handler arrived, White said WIRES had explained to him: “If you get bitten, you’ve got to go to hospital really quickly.”

ALDI is investigating how a snake could have found its way into a supermarket.

“We’ve worked with the customer and the team at WIRES to identify the snake’s natural habitat, which is certainly not an ALDI store!” the German-based supermarket chain said in a statement.

WIRES reptile coordinator Gary Pattinson said while the snake was less than 20 centimeters (8 inches) long, it was “as venomous as it will ever be.”

Pattinson is caring for the snake until it is returned to Queensland state next week, following the WIRES policy of returning rescued wildlife to where it comes from.

“It’s the first snake I’ve ever had in sealed, packed produce,” Pattinson said. “We get frogs in them all the time.”

Neate, a German immigrant, said her brush with a venomous snake in a Sydney kitchen was a setback in her efforts to assure relatives in Europe that Australia’s notoriously deadly Outback wildlife was nothing to worry about.

“For the last 10 years or so, I’ve told my family at home that Australia’s a really safe country,” Neate said.

“I’ve always said I’m just in the city; it’s totally fine here,” she added.",540,3180,9,55

KURNOOL: People celebrated Telugu New Year Ugadi in a unique way in Kurnool on Wednesday. A day after Ugadi, Kairuppa villagers hurled cow dung cakes at one another as part of the Ugadi celebrations and people in Kalluru took out a procession of donkeys during the Chowdeswari Utsavams. In Kairuppala village of Aspari mandal, people celebrated Peddanuggulata, also called pidakala samara (fighting with cow dung cakes).

The villagers divided into two groups and hurled cow dung cakes at one another when a procession of Lord Veerabhadra Swamy was taken out. The dung cakes were made a month ahead of the celebration.

This celebration has a myth behind it. When Veerabhadra Swamy, a Lingayat, wanted to marry Kalika Devi, a woman from the SC community, there was a clash between the two communities. To bring about peace, the village headmen sat together and arranged the marriage and all was well again.

Continuing the tradition, the village heads sit together after the dung fight and perform the marriage of Veerabhadra Swamy. People from Lingayat, Reddy and Muslim communities represent Veerabhadra Swamy’s side while the SC, Yadav and Kuruma communities represent Kalika’s side. As many as 100 persons were injured in the traditional fight, but no one complained to the police, Aspari sub-inspector Giri Babu said. Similarly, the Chowdeswari Ugadi Utsavam in Kalluru locality of Kurnool Municipal Corporation limit was also held in a different way.

Sludge was arranged for about 3-feet depth around the Chowdeswari temple and donkeys were made to cross it. On every Ugadi, donkeys are taken on a procession to the temple from different parts of Kurnool. The animals are made to go around the temple through the sludge. After the perambulation, the donkeys are given a bath, decorated and worshiped. “It is believed that making the donkeys walk in the slush will usher in peace and prosperity in the society,” temple priest Srinivasa said.",320,1972,29,160

REUTERS/David W Cerny/File Photo

The Czech Republic is expelling 18 Russian diplomats over suspicions that Russian intelligence services were involved in an ammunition depot explosion in 2014, its government said on Saturday.

The central European country is a NATO and EU member state, and the expulsions and allegations have triggered its biggest row with Russia since the end of the communist era in 1989.

Its actions could prompt Russia to consider closing the Czech Republic’s embassy in Moscow, a diplomatic source cited by Russian news agency Interfax suggested.

Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said in a briefing shown live on television that there was “well-grounded suspicion about the involvement of officers of the Russian intelligence service GRU... in the explosion of an ammunitions depot in the Vrbetice area.”

Several explosions shook the Vrbetice depot, 330 km (205 miles) southeast of Prague, in October 2014, killing two employees of a private company that was renting the site from a state military organisation.

Babis called the circumstances “unprecedented and scandalous”, while a Russian lawmaker cited by Interfax described his allegation as absurd.

The U.S. embassy in Prague said on Twitter that Washington “stands with its steadfast ally, the Czech Republic. We appreciate their significant action to impose costs on Russia for its dangerous actions on Czech soil.”

Acting Czech Foreign Minister Jan Hamacek said the 18 Russian embassy staff, identified as secret service personnel, would be ordered to leave within 48 hours.

LINK TO SKRIPAL POISONING?

Hamacek drew a parallel with the poisoning of Russian spy Sergei Skripal in Britain in 2018, and Czech police said separately they were searching for two men carrying Russian passports in connection with serious criminal activity in the names of Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov.

Those were the aliases used by two Russian military intelligence officers who British prosecutors charged with Skripal’s attempted murder. They and Moscow both denied involvement. [nL8N2MA0FD]

Hamacek said he had “decided to expel all personnel at the Russian embassy in Prague who were clearly identified by our secret services as officers of Russia’s secret services, SVR and GRU.”

The Interfax news agency cited Vladimir Dzhabarov, first deputy head of the upper house’s international affairs committee, as saying Prague’s claims were absurd and Russia’s response should be proportionate.

Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with a nerve agent in the English city of Salisbury in March 2018.

The attack prompted the biggest wave of diplomatic expulsions between Moscow and the West since the Cold War.

Czech police said Petrov and Boshirov, whose whose birth names British government documents have given as Alexander Mishkin and Anatoly Chepigas, had also used a Moldovan passport in the name of Nicolai Popa and a Tajik one issued in the name of Ruslan Tabarov.

Police said both men were believed to have been in the Czech Republic from Oct. 11 until Oct. 16, 2014, the day of the explosion. They were first in Prague and later in the eastern regions, which is where the depot is based.

Russia would not extradite them, Interfax said, citing an unnamed source.

“Russia’s main law prohibits the extradition to a foreign state of Russian citizens accused of committing a crime on the territory of a foreign state,” the source was quoted as saying.

Babis said the Czech investigation linked the suspects to a Russian military intelligence GRU unit 29155.

The New York Times reported in 2019 that 29155 was an elite unit inside the Russian intelligence system skilled in subversion, sabotage and assassination.

0,Saudi crown prince asked Boris Johnson to intervene in Newcastle United bid. Mohammed bin Salman warned of damage to Saudi-UK relations if Premier League refusal not ‘corrected’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/15/saudis-asked-boris-johnson-to-intervene-in-newcastle-united-bid,"The Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, warned Boris Johnson in a text message that UK-Saudi Arabian relations would be damaged if the British government failed to intervene to “correct” the Premier League’s “wrong” decision not to allow a £300m takeover of Newcastle United last year.

Johnson asked Edward Lister, his special envoy for the Gulf, to take up the issue, and Lord Lister reportedly told the prime minister: “I’m on the case. I will investigate.”

The message stemmed from an attempt by a consortium led by the sovereign wealth fund, the Saudi Public Investment Fund, to buy Newcastle from its current owner, Mike Ashley.

A deal was agreed in April last year, which was then scrutinised by the Premier League under its owners’ and directors’ test, because the league had doubts about the independence of the bid team from the Saudi government. In July the consortium, which described itself as an “autonomous and purely commercial investor”, withdrew from the deal, blaming an “unforeseeably prolonged process”.

The Daily Mail, which first reported on the lobbying attempt by Prince Mohammed, said the message to Johnson was sent on 27 June and read: “We expect the English Premier League to reconsider and correct its wrong conclusion.”

Lister told the Mail: “The Saudis were getting upset. We were not lobbying for them to buy it or not to buy it. We wanted [the Premier League] to be straightforward and say ‘yes’ or ‘no’, don’t leave [the Saudis] dangling.”

Johnson and his ministers have shown sympathy for the bid but do not have the direct power to overrule the Premier League.

In August, Johnson, aware of how popular the bid had been with some football fans in north-east England, wrote to members of the Newcastle United Supporters Trust: “I appreciate many Newcastle fans were hoping this takeover bid would go ahead and can understand their sense of disappointment. I have seen the recent email sent to Newcastle fans from the Independent Football Ombudsman and agree with their conclusion that the Premier League should make a statement on this case.”

Saudi Arabia has long been jealous of its arch rival Qatar’s involvement in Paris Saint-Germain football club, and the involvement of a United Arab Emirates consortium in Manchester City.

In February this year the Biden administration released a declassified intelligence report which concluded that Prince Mohammed had approved the 2018 murder of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Human rights groups say the Saudi government has acted with impunity since 2018, including through arbitrary arrests of critics of the prince, as well as his potential political rivals.

“The bid to buy Newcastle was a blatant example of Saudi sportswashing, so it’s worrying that the prime minister would accede in any way to pressure from the crown prince over the deal,” said Amnesty International’s UK director, Kate Allen.

Freedom of information requests show the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport bombarded the Premier League in June 2020 with updates on how the decision on the bid was going. The DCMS said the Foreign Office’s Saudi desk was involved in responding to the decision, showing the political sensitivity of the issue for the UK government.

The DCMS argues that the emails do not represent pressure, merely requests to keep the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, abreast of the decisions.

The tensions at the top of the government over the role of Prince Mohammed are revealed in the diaries of the former Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan, which were published this week.

On 10 October 2018, soon after the murder of Khashoggi, Duncan wrote: “The Saudi issue is massive. He was murdered and sliced up. It’s a gamechanger. I think we should take a lead at international level by saying we love the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia but have growing doubts about MBS. Aim for the man and not the country. We should … but we cannot afford to … so we won’t.”

Elsewhere in his diaries, he accuses Prince Mohammed of “bombing Yemen to bits”. Duncan wrote that, acting on a tip-off, he had offered to provide Johnson with a list of disappeared Saudi princes.

Amnesty said: “At the time that the crown prince was putting this pressure on No 10, the world was still reeling from the fallout over Khashoggi’s murder, Saudi human rights activists like Loujain al-Hathloul were languishing in jail, and Saudi warplanes were indiscriminately bombing Yemen.

“This whole tangled affair only underlines how there needs to be a proper overhaul of the Premier League’s owners’ and directors’ test to provide proper human rights scrutiny of who is trying to buy into the glamour and prestige of English football.”

A UK government spokesman said the sale had been a “commercial matter” and that the government was not involved at any point in the takeover talks.",814,4942,27,177
1,Local Man Ruins Date By Just Being Himself,https://local.theonion.com/local-man-ruins-date-by-just-being-himself-1819566845,"LA JOLLA, CA–Wrongly advised by friends and family to ""just be himself,"" local tax attorney Marc Scanlon, 34, ruined a first date with Rachel Loftus by doing just that, sources close to the never-to-be couple reported Monday.

Marc Scanlon, who made the error of being relaxed and authentic on the date.

""Marc was really nervous that Rachel wouldn't like him, and he kept obsessing over his appearance, his hair, what he should wear, and how he should act on the date,"" said Glenn Carlson, 40, a coworker of Scanlon's at the law firm of Jenkins & Straud. ""I told him not to worry, that he should just be his true self and everything would be okay. Turns out, that was bad advice. On a first date, Marc's true self is pretty much exactly what most normal women don't want.""

Divorced since 2001, Scanlon met the 29-year-old Loftus through mutual acquaintance Barbara O'Neill. Thinking the two might make a good match–despite not knowing much about Scanlon personally–O'Neill set the pair up on a blind date.

The date was, according to Loftus, one of her worst ever. Sources say the blame lay in Scanlon's ill-advised decision to put pretense aside, revealing his true identity and destroying any chance he might have had with Loftus.

""I'm glad he felt comfortable being himself,"" said brother Chris Scanlon, 39. ""But when you're in full-blown mid-30s-crisis mode with misogynist tendencies and a desperate, neurotic need for approval, maybe 'the real you' is not the best thing to put forward.""

According to reports, Scanlon's profound insecurity led him to monopolize the first 45 minutes of conversation, talking about nothing but himself. Worse, his inability to get over his divorce prompted him to meticulously detail every phase of his failed marriage.

""It's totally understandable that he's still feeling hurt and emotionally shaky from the breakup,"" Loftus said. ""But that's the sort of thing you should keep buried deep down inside when you're first letting someone get to know you.""

""Sure, in theory, a guy should be able to relax and be himself,"" Loftus continued. ""But when you have such issues about aging that you show up to a date wearing a Billy Joel 'River Of Dreams World Tour' concert T-shirt under your sportjacket, you're putting up a neon sign on your forehead that says, 'Do Not Fuck Me, Ever.' I mean, this guy's a tax lawyer in his 30s. Did he think he was coming across as rockin' or something? Please.""

Loftus added that, while there is nothing inherently wrong with a date mentioning that he attended Yale University, bringing it up every 10 minutes is probably not a good idea.

Advertisement

""Yale this, Yale that,"" Loftus said. ""Any way he could work it into the conversation, he would. It was so obvious that he was clinging to his Ivy League pedigree out of insecurity, as a way of making himself look like an intelligent man of substance. It really just made him look like a dick.""

Scanlon's inability to self-monitor further turned off Loftus when he disclosed ""way, way, way too much"" about his opinions on sex and relationships.

Advertisement

""He must have thought the honest approach would make him look like an open, non-uptight kind of guy,'"" said waitress Susan Sanders, who served the pair during their excruciating two-hour dinner engagement. ""Sexual frankness and maturity are great, but there's such a thing as inappropriate personal revelations. Do you really need to mention on a first date that you're 'totally cool with porn'?""

Those close to Scanlon report that he remains unaware that the date was a disaster, leaving repeated messages on Loftus' voicemail asking when they can ""hook up"" again.

Advertisement

Carlson predicted, however, that Scanlon's insecurity will soon begin to steadily mount with each passing day his calls are not returned, and that, inevitably, he will launch into an exhaustive self-pity session over Loftus' rejection of him.

""I'm sure Marc's next date, whoever she may be, will hear all about it–if he ever gets another date,"" Carlson said. ""If he does, I'm going to suggest he try being nothing remotely like himself.""",690,4156,8,42

But he wanted to gather what samples he could, so he ascended a short distance to find some cleaner snow off to the side of the trail. “I just pulled out the bottles and took samples,” he said.

And then another surprise: There, at the roof of the world, the snow samples showed traces of toxic chemicals known as PFAS, laboratory analyses done later showed. More notable results came from samples his colleagues gathered at lower elevation, which revealed these substances at levels far higher than at other mountains around the world.

“We were shocked,” said Kimberley Miner, an assistant research professor at the University of Maine Climate Change Institute, who coordinated the research remotely from the United States. “We retested everything like three times, because it was much higher than we expected.”

The study by Miner and colleagues, published in December, was part of the 2019 National Geographic and Rolex Perpetual Planet Everest Expedition, a large, interdisciplinary research project intended to understand the climate change threats facing mountain systems. It shows chemical fingerprints smudging even the world’s tallest peak in ways unseen and previously unstudied.

“The purpose of the expedition was to see if the highest parts of the planet are affected by human activity,” said Paul Mayewski, the expedition leader and director of the university’s Climate Change Institute.

Miner’s research has taken her all over the world to study chemicals in glaciers, especially persistent organic pollutants such as PFAS — shorthand for per- and polyfluorinated substances. Sometimes called “forever chemicals,” these are toxic compounds that break down slowly and accumulate over time in people and other animals.

Such pollutants are found in low concentrations in the atmosphere, and they are blown all over the globe. Then, when it rains or snows, they often are deposited on the ground. So Miner suspected the Everest samples would only show low levels of persistent chemicals from this sort of atmospheric deposition.

But when the Everest samples were shipped to an analytical lab, she learned about the PFAS levels that were particularly high in the samples from lower down on the mountain.

“I thought we’d screwed up, and we hadn’t,” Miner said. “We got consistently these very, very high levels.”

Miner’s samples showed two specific PFAS chemicals were especially high — perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). The chemicals have been used since the 1950s to repel stains and water in carpeting, upholstery and apparel; in nonstick cookware and food packaging; and in floor wax, textiles, fire fighting foam and sealants. Neither is still manufactured in the United States, but they are made in other countries.

Both have been linked to health problems. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, “both chemicals are very persistent in the environment and in the human body — meaning they don’t break down and they can accumulate over time. There is evidence that exposure to PFAS can lead to adverse human health effects.”

These effects may include increased cholesterol, changes in liver enzymes and increased risk of kidney or testicular cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“What we found was that the PFOS was at such higher levels than had been reported anywhere else in high mountain ranges,” Miner said. “And then the rest of the story was how the heck did these get there, and why were they so high?”

Fortunately, Cyclone Fani dropped 10 inches of fresh snow while the expedition was still at the Everest Base Camp, where a colleague of Miner’s at the Climate Change Institute, Heather Clifford, was gathering samples for the team. (The Base Camp is at an elevation of about 17,400 feet and more than 1,000 people were there at the time.)

Story continues below advertisement

Clifford took samples of the fresh snow, and one of the samples showed no PFAS; the other a trace. Taken together, the findings suggest that the high levels of PFAS were not from atmospheric deposition. Instead, it appeared that they had been shed from climbers’ outdoor gear such as parkas and tents, which are often treated with chemicals to weatherproof.

Other samples, gathered for a different research group, found microplastics — shreds of polyester — that probably came from outdoor gear. The plastic levels were highest in the areas most used by climbing teams, as with PFAS.

“You’re seeing the highest concentrations where you have the most people and the most garbage,” Miner said. “It’s kind of like sampling a frozen landfill.”

Fabric companies have long used PFAS to repel water in outerwear, although some companies have now moved away from the chemicals for environmental reasons. W.L. Gore & Associates, the maker of Gore-Tex, for instance, said the company does use some chemicals in the PFAS family, but has transitioned to those believed to be less harmful, Gore spokesperson Amy Calhoun said. Of the four compounds Miner detected on Everest, Calhoun said, three “have either been eliminated from or never used in Gore’s consumer fabrics supply chain.” But traces of the fourth one may still be detected in some of its products.

Rainer Lohmann leads a University of Rhode Island research center focused on PFAS. He said he accepts that the chemicals Miner found probably came from outdoor gear, but said he would like to see more sampling on Everest to fill out the picture.

Lohmann said the levels of PFAS in Everest meltwater, although higher than expected from an alpine glacier, would still be within safe drinking water limits in the United States.

Still, Miner said she is concerned about possible health risks as more chemicals melt out of glaciers.

“The more chemicals and the more plastics we put into the environment, the more they are going to build up and they are going to stay, and they are not going to go away,” Miner said. “And it is going to impact us more and more, in lots of different interlocking ways.”

Lohmann said it is especially striking to see this pollution on Everest.

A Norwegian conspiracy theorist, who believed COVID-19 was a hoax, has died from the virus just days after hosting two illegal gatherings at his property, according to officials.

Hans Kristian Gaarder, 60, from Gran, a municipality that lies 40 miles north of Oslo, tested positive for the virus after dying on April 6, officials said this week.

""A man in his 60s, living in Gran, has died after being ill with coronavirus. The person was not tested for coronavirus before he died, but it is confirmed afterward that he was infected with the virus,"" the municipality of Gran said in a statement on their website, according to Metro.

Gaarder's death comes several days after he hosted two illegal house parties on March 26 and 27. It is unclear how many people attended. He is thought to have been ill for several weeks but kept it secret local officials believe, newsinenglish.no reported.

Local media reported that more than a dozen attendees have since tested positive for the virus and continued to pass it on.

""We don't know how many or who took part in the arrangements, but ask all participants to take a corona test as soon as possible,"" police said in a press release, according to newsinenglish.no.

Gaarder was a prominent conspiracy theorist who used various social media channels to peddle false information relating to the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the US election in 2020.

He frequently compared COVID-19 to ""something that will be like a cold or light flu"" and incorrectly argued that it doesn't spread from person to person.

Gaarder also frequently posted about the Illuminati and argued that Joe Biden's election victory in 2020 was illegitimate.

Last month, the municipality of Gan banned social gatherings to prevent the further spread of the virus.

""We must do all we can to support free elections in America and allow democracy to gain a foothold there,"" Kostunica said. ""The U.S. is a major player in the Western Hemisphere and its continued stability is vital to Serbian interests in that region.""

Kostunica urged Al Gore, the U.S. opposition-party leader who is refusing to recognize the nation's Nov. 7 election results, to ""let the democratic process take its course.""

""Mr. Gore needs to acknowledge the will of the people and concede that he has lost this election,"" Kostunica said. ""Until America's political figures learn to respect the institutions that have been put in place, the nation will never be a true democracy.""

Serbian forces have been stationed throughout the U.S., with an emphasis on certain trouble zones. Among them are Oregon, Florida, and eastern Tennessee, where Gore set up headquarters in Bush territory. An additional 10,000 troops are expected to arrive in the capital city of Washington, D.C. by Friday.

Though Kostunica has pledged to work with U.S. leaders, he did not rule out the possibility of economic sanctions if the crisis is not resolved soon.

""For democracy to take root and flourish, it must be planted in the rich soil of liberty. And the cornerstone of liberty is elections free of tampering or corruption,"" Kostunica said.

0,United States and China are 'committed to cooperating' to tackle climate change,https://www.sbs.com.au/news/united-states-and-china-are-committed-to-cooperating-to-tackle-climate-change,"The United States and China are ""committed to cooperating"" on the pressing issue of climate change, the two sides said Saturday, issuing the pledge days ahead of a key summit hosted by President Joe Biden.

The joint statement came after a trip to Shanghai by US climate envoy John Kerry, the first official from Mr Biden's administration to visit China, signalling hopes the two sides could work together on the global challenge despite sky-high tensions on multiple other fronts.

But to achieve the global climate goal, Mr Kerry said words must be put into action and urged China to reduce its use of coal.

""The United States and China are committed to cooperating with each other and with other countries to tackle the climate crisis, which must be addressed with the seriousness and urgency that it demands,"" said the statement from Mr Kerry and China's special envoy for climate change Xie Zhenhua.

It listed multiple avenues of climate cooperation between the world's top two economies which together account for nearly half of the greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change.

It stressed ""enhancing their respective actions and cooperating in multilateral processes, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement.""

Both countries also ""look forward"" to a virtual climate summit of world leaders that Mr Biden will host next week, though the statement did not say if Chinese President Xi Jinping would attend.

""We very much hope he will take part,"" Mr Kerry, who is now in South Korea, told reporters on Sunday.

""Of course, every country will make its own decisions,"" he said, adding: ""We're not seeking to force anybody. We're seeking cooperation.""

'Biggest coal user'

China currently has about half of the world's coal power, Mr Kerry said, adding that he ""talked a lot"" about it with officials in Shanghai.

""I am not pointing fingers,"" said Mr Kerry.

""We've had too much coal, other countries have too much coal, but China is the biggest, biggest coal user in the world,"" he added.

""And because it's such a big and powerful economy and country, it needs to move.""

Mr Biden has made climate a top priority, turning the page from his predecessor Donald Trump, who was closely aligned with the fossil fuel industry.

The US president has rejoined the 2015 Paris accord, which Mr Kerry negotiated when he was secretary of state, and committed nations to taking action to keep the temperature from rising no more than two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

With the world badly off track to meeting the goal, Mr Biden hopes his summit will result in stronger pledges in advance of UN-led climate talks in Glasgow at the end of the year.

'Unequivocal commitment'

According to their statement, both Washington and Beijing ""intend to develop"" their respective long-term strategies to achieve carbon neutrality by the Glasgow meeting.

Other moves in the near term include boosting ""international investment and finance"" to support the transition to green energy in developing countries, as well as phasing out production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons, gases used in refrigeration, air conditioners and aerosols.

Longer-term actions that need to be taken to keep the temperature goals of the Paris accord ""within reach"" include reducing emissions from industry and power generation while stepping up renewable energy, clean transportation and climate-resistant agriculture.

The United States and China's pledge to cooperate on climate follows recent acrimony over accusations about China's policies in Hong Kong and its treatment of Uighurs in its northwestern Xinjiang region - criticisms Beijing rejects as interference in its domestic affairs.

If the United States refuses to work with China on climate because of other disagreements, ""you're just killing yourself,"" Mr Kerry told CNN before his trip to Shanghai.

Li Shuo, a policy advisor at Greenpeace East Asia, said the joint statement showed the ""unequivocal commitment"" of the United States and China in tackling climate change and should ""put global climate momentum back on high gear.""

0,"US expels Russian diplomats, imposes sanctions for hacking",https://apnews.com/article/us-expel-russia-diplomats-sanctions-6a8a54c7932ee8cbe51b0ce505121995,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration announced Thursday the U.S. is expelling 10 Russian diplomats and imposing sanctions against several dozen people and companies, holding the Kremlin accountable for interference in last year’s presidential election and the hacking of federal agencies.

The sweeping measures are meant to punish Russia for actions that U.S. officials say cut to the core of American democracy and to deter future acts by imposing economic costs on Moscow, including by targeting its ability to borrow money. The sanctions are certain to exacerbate tensions with Russia, which promised a response, even as President Joe Biden said the administration could have taken even more punitive measures but chose not to in the interests of maintaining stability.

“We cannot allow a foreign power to interfere in our democratic process with impunity,” Biden said at the White House.

Sanctions against six Russian companies that support the country’s cyber efforts represent the first retaliatory measures against the Kremlin for the hack familiarly known as the SolarWinds breach, with the U.S. explicitly linking the intrusion to the SVR, a Russian intelligence agency. Though such intelligence-gathering missions are not uncommon, officials said they were determined to respond because of the operation’s broad scope and the high cost of the intrusion on private companies.

The U.S. also announced sanctions on 32 individuals and entities accused of attempting to influence last year’s presidential election, including by spreading disinformation. U.S. officials alleged in a declassified report last month that Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized influence operations to help Donald Trump in his unsuccessful bid for reelection as president, though there’s no evidence Russia or anyone else changed votes or manipulated the outcome.

The actions, foreshadowed by the administration for weeks, signal a harder line against Putin, whom Trump was reluctant to criticize even as his administration pursued sanctions against Moscow. They are the administration’s second major foreign policy move in two days, following the announcement of troop withdrawals from Afghanistan. Until now, Biden has largely focused on the coronavirus pandemic and economy in his first months in office.

Biden said that when he advised Putin days earlier of the forthcoming measures — which included expulsion of the 10 diplomats, some of them representatives of Russian intelligence services — he told the Russian leader “that we could have gone further but I chose not to do so. I chose to be proportionate.”

“We want,” he said, “a stable, predictable relationship.”

Even so, Russian officials spoke of a swift response, with Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov warning that “a series of retaliatory measures will come in the nearest time.”

Other American measures are expected, though the administration is not likely to announce them. Officials have advised that their response to Russia would be in ways both seen and unseen.

The sanctions are the latest in a series of actions that successive presidential administrations have taken to counter Russian behavior seen as antagonistic. It is unclear whether the new U.S. actions will result in changed behavior, especially since past measures — both Trump and Barack Obama expelled individual diplomats during their presidencies — have failed to bring an end to Russian hacking.

But experts suggest this latest round, even while not guaranteed to curb cyberattacks, might have more resonance because of its financial impact: The order makes it more difficult for Russia to borrow money by barring U.S. banks from buying Russian bonds directly from the Russian Central Bank, Russian National Wealth Fund and Finance Ministry. It could complicate Russian efforts to raise capital and give companies pause about doing business in Russia.

The impact of the sanctions and the U.S. willingness to impose costs will be weighed by Putin, though he is unlikely to make “a 180” degree pivot in his behavior, said Daniel Fried, a former assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs.

“The issue is, how can we push back against Putin’s aggression, while at the same time keeping open channels of communication and continuing to cooperate with Russia in areas of mutual interest,” Fried said. “And it seems to me the Biden administration has done a pretty good job framing up the relationship in exactly this way.”

Eric Lorber, a former Treasury Department official now with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the administration, is “surely trying to balance putting pressure on Russia, pushing back on Russia, while at the same time, not engaging in full-fledged economic warfare.”

The White House did not impose sanctions related to separate reports that Russia encouraged the Taliban to attack U.S. and allied troops in Afghanistan, saying instead that Biden was using diplomatic, military and intelligence channels to respond.

Reports of alleged “bounties” surfaced last year, with the Trump administration drawing criticism for not raising the issue directly with Russia. Administration officials said Thursday they had only low to moderate confidence in that intelligence, in part because of the ways in which the information was obtained, including from interrogations of Afghan detainees.

Among the companies sanctioned are websites U.S. officials say operate as fronts for Russian intelligence agencies and spread disinformation, including articles alleging widespread voter fraud in 2020. The individuals who were targeted include Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian and Ukrainian political consultant who worked with former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and who was indicted in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.

The Treasury Department said Thursday that Kilimnik had provided “sensitive information on polling and campaign strategy” to Russian intelligence services. That went further than Mueller’s office, which said in 2019 that it had been unable to determine what Kilimnik had done with the polling data after getting it from the Trump campaign.

Also sanctioned were the Kremlin’s first deputy chief of staff, Alexei Gromov, several individuals linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman with close ties to Russia’s president, nicknamed “Putin’s chef” for serving Kremlin functions, and several front companies the U.S. says helped Prigozhin evade sanctions imposed earlier.

The U.S. also sanctioned eight individuals and entities tied to Russia’s occupation in Crimea.

Biden informed Putin that the sanctions were coming earlier this week. Administration officials have made clear in their contacts with the Russia side that they are hoping to avoid a “downward spiral” in the relationship, according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity following the sanctions announcement.

The two leaders had a tense call in which Biden told Putin to “de-escalate tensions” following a Russian military buildup on Ukraine’s border, and said the U.S. would “act firmly in defense of its national interests” regarding Russian intrusions and election interference.

In a television interview last month, Biden replied “I do” when asked if he thought Putin was a “killer.” He said the days of the U.S. “rolling over” to Putin were done. Putin later recalled his ambassador to the U.S. and pointed at the U.S. history of slavery and slaughtering Native Americans and the atomic bombing of Japan in World War II.

U.S. officials are still grappling with the aftereffects of the SolarWinds intrusion, which affected agencies including the Treasury, Justice and Homeland Security departments.

The sheer lack of positive experiences he’s had with football probably mean he’s scarred for life, but that doesn’t make him a bad quarterback. We think with some love and attention, he could get healthy and maybe even become a decent backup.” At press time, Sam had scrambled under a bench and started crying after seeing the Jets logo on the Panthers 2021 regular season schedule.

But now we have a piece of truly perplexing news that we’re going to need someone to sort out for us. Today, in separate press conferences, the biggest publishers in the world just revealed that the upcoming installments in the Super Mario, Grand Theft Auto, and Metal Gear Solid franchises are somehow all subtitled “ The Sands of Time” ?

Your guess is as good as ours, gamers. We got nothing on this one.

While we’re incredibly excited to have Nintendo, Rockstar Games, and Hideo Kojima all taking the stage on the same day, we’re also having a tremendous amount of trouble wrapping our heads around why each of the developers’ latest games seems to be named after the 2003 action-platformer set in ancient Persia—or are they? We really have no idea.

It’s especially confusing given that most of the titles in some way makes use of an hourglass in the graphic. You could argue that it was just a mistake if it only happened to be one of these companies that adopted the “Sands of Time” suffix. But all three? It just doesn’t make any sense.

Super Mario: Sands of Time. Grand Theft Auto: The Sands of Time. Metal Gear Solid: The Sands of Time. We’re not going to act like these aren’t cool titles. They definitely are. But we’d assume that Ubisoft would have the exclusive rights to that phrase. Even if not, why would any other game developer want to associate their games with such an iconic phrase? It’s simply not possible that nobody at any of these three major video game companies had ever heard of the original “Sands of Time” game. That was one of the most popular titles of the sixth console generation.

Does anyone understand how this could have happened? Anyone?

We’re just going to go ahead and assume that each game has some sort of time-travel element too, but why would these publishers do that? How could all three of them possibly use this mechanic in an inventive way?

Please don’t take our confusion as negativity, gamers. These are huge announcements for some of the most popular franchises in video game history. We’re talking about a new Metal Gear Solid, a series long thought dead since Kojima’s departure from Konami. And new titles in Mario and Grand Theft Auto? This is incredibly exciting stuff. All we’re saying is that it’s kind of incomprehensible why any single one of them would choose to have a title that had already been used 17 years ago.

We reached out to programmers at Nintendo, Rockstar, and Konami about it, but they refused to respond and seemed genuinely angry that we questioned this baffling decision.

Are they fucking with us?

Seriously, gamers, if anyone knows what the hell is going on here please let us know. Maybe there’s some sort of movement to establish “Sands of Time” as its own video game genre subset that we don’t know about? Or for some reason, all future video ga mes will be named after Prince Of Persia games or Jake Gyllenhaal films? Whatever the truth is, we’re confused but prepared to enjoy these awesome new games alongside the just announced Prince of Persia: The Origami King.",560,3230,23,132

In the letter, Bolsonaro said he is committed to eliminating illegal deforestation in the Amazon by 2030. However, he also said that ""massive resources"" will be needed and the support of ""the United States government, the private sector and the American civil society will be very welcome.""

The letter also confirms Bolsonaro's participation in a virtual climate summit convened by Biden on April 22 and 23. ""I pledge my commitment to the pursuit of ambitious commitments and outcomes at the April 22nd summit,"" he said.

A senior administration official confirmed to CNN that the White House had received the letter.

""The White House is in receipt of President Bolsonaro's letter accepting the invitation to participate in the April 22 Leaders' Summit on Climate. Brazil is one of the world's top 10 economies, and a regional leader; it has a responsibility to lead,"" the senior official said in a statement on Thursday.

Momeen Rezaei, secretary of the Expediency Discernment Council that reports directly to the supreme leader, told Iran’s Mehr News on Wednesday that the country needs a major revamp of its security.

“The country has been widely exposed to security violations, and the example is that in less than a year, three security incidents have occurred: two explosions and one assassination,” said Rezaei.

The two explosions took place at the Natanz nuclear site, first in July, taking out about three-fourths of the above-ground centrifuge assembly facility, and then on Sunday night, when the site’s electric grid and backup system were destroyed, along with large numbers of centrifuges. The assassination was of the head of Iran’s nuclear program, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, in November.

“Before this, documents from our entire nuclear [archive] have been stolen, and before that, a few suspicious drones came and did some work,” Rezaei added.

When the Mossad smuggled the nuclear archive out of Iran in 2018, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presenting evidence that the Islamic Republic aimed to develop a nuclear weapon, Iran denied that it was real. Iran nuclear negotiator Abbas Araghchi called it “a very childish and even a ridiculous play.” Mohammad Marandi, one of Iran’s negotiators in the 2015 nuclear deal, said Israel had “fabricated evidence.”

Rezaei said this week’s attack on Natanz was “a bad event in terms of prestige,” and that “they did it to break our resistance in diplomacy.”

0,Fierce Beijing critic Jimmy Lai jailed for 14 months over Hong Kong pro-democracy protests,https://abcnews.go.com/International/fierce-beijing-critic-jimmy-lai-jailed-14-months/story?id=77112720&amp;cid=clicksource_4380645_14_comic_strip_sq_hed,"Hong Kong's rebel media tycoon Jimmy Lai was sentenced to 14 months in prison in Hong Kong District Court Friday after being found guilty of charges related to pro-democracy protests in 2019.

Lai, a 73-year-old billionaire and founder of pro-democracy paper Apple Daily, has been remanded in jail since December.

In addition, Hong Kong's ""father of democracy"" Martin Lee, 83, was given suspended sentences for the Aug. 18 and Aug. 31 protests, which were sparked by a widely unpopular extradition bill, which would have allowed suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial. Anger over the proposed legislation grew into a broader call for democracy in the Chinese-ruled territory. The mass protests lasted for more than six months, plunging Asia's financial hub into crisis.

It represented the biggest form of resistance to the Chinese Communist Party in a generation.

The two are among a handful of other prominent activists and lawmakers charged with organizing and taking part in what authorities called unauthorized assemblies. At least four of the other defendants were jailed up to 18 months.

""The sentences handed down are incompatible with the non-violent nature of their actions,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. ""We will continue to stand with Hong Kongers as they respond to Beijing’s assault on these freedoms and autonomy, and we will not stop calling for the release of those detained or imprisoned for exercising their fundamental freedoms.""

It's the first sentencing for Lai, who has been denied bail in a separate national security trial. On Friday, prosecutors also added two more charges to Lai's national security case, related to his alleged assistance of fugitive Andy Li. Li was among 12 Hong Kong activists intercepted at sea by the Chinese coast guard during a failed escape bid last year. That case is adjourned until June 15, while another fraud case leveled against Lai will be heard in May.

Lai was arrested on Aug. 10 under the controversial national security law, which Beijing imposed on Hong Kong at the end of June to clamp down on the pro-democracy movement after last year's unrest.

The national security law targets succession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, but critics say it breaches the ""One Country, Two Systems"" framework, which is meant to guarantee Hong Kong people a degree of autonomy and freedom not afforded to the mainland.

There have been a wave of arrests and prosecutions of activists since the law came into effect, with many of the territory's most well-known pro-democracy figures either behind bars or in self-imposed exile.

Speaking with ABC News at his home while he was out on bail in September, Lai said that Apple Daily will push on, despite the odds.

Last week, Lai sent a handwritten letter to his colleagues, published in Apple Daily, from prison: ""It is our responsibility as journalists to seek justice. As long as we are not blinded by unjust temptations, as long as we do not let evil get its way through us, we are fulfilling our responsibility.""",507,3084,14,90
0,Study Warns of Catastrophe if Explosion Takes Place at Yemen's Safer Oil Tanker: FSO Safer is currently holding 1.1 million barrels of crude oil that are at a risk of either exploding or spilling into Red Sea waters.,https://english.aawsat.com/home/article/2920636/study-warns-catastrophe-if-explosion-takes-place-yemens-safer-oil-tanker,"A picture of the deteriorating condition of FSO Safer in 2019 (AP)

Aden - Mohammed Nasser

A recent study has warned that the coastline of Yemen’s Red Sea and of its neighboring countries is at risk of an environmental disaster that could happen any day if an oil spill from or an explosion takes place at the derelict FSO Safer oil tanker.

“It is increasingly likely that there could be an immense oil leakage from and/or an explosion of the FSO Safer, a floating storage and offloading unit anchored in the Red Sea, 60km north of the port of Hodeidah,” said Riskaware, Catapult Satellite Applications and Acaps in their joint assessment.

Although it is owned by Yemen’s national oil company, FSO Safer fell into the hands of Iran-backed Houthi militias in 2015. Since then, no maintenance work has been carried out on the aging tanker.

Disregarding international warnings against the hazards of poor maintenance at FSO Safer, Houthis continue to block a team of UN experts from repairing the rundown oil vessel.

FSO Safer is currently holding 1.1 million barrels of crude oil that are at a risk of either exploding or spilling into Red Sea waters.

“Up to 5.9 million people in Yemen and 1 million in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) could be exposed to very high air pollution levels, with harmful effects seen 24–48 hours after a fire starting on the Safer,” said study.

In its impact assessment for April-June 2021, the study warned that up to 967,000 internally displaced persons could be covered by a smoke plume if an explosion goes off at Safer.

The fire, according to the study, would likely affect Yemen’s governorates of Hajjah, Hodeidah, Sadah, Dhamar, Sanaa, Al Mahwit, and Raymah.

Saudi Arabia’s southern Jazan city could also be affected, the study added.

“There would be a significant health risk to vulnerable populations (such as adults and children with lung problems and adults with heart problems) and the elderly, with aggravation of pre-existing heart and lung problems likely,” it highlighted.

Pollution from a fire taking place on FSO Safer would create an additional hazard for coronavirus patients with breathing problems.",359,2161,38,216
0,Facebook planned to remove fake accounts in India – until it realized a BJP politician was involved,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/15/facebook-india-bjp-fake-accounts?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other,"Facebook allowed a network of fake accounts to artificially inflate the popularity of an MP from India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), for months after being alerted to the problem.

The company was preparing to remove the fake accounts but paused when it found evidence that the politician was probably directly involved in the network, internal documents seen by the Guardian show.

The company’s decision not to take timely action against the network, which it had already determined violated its policies, is just the latest example of Facebook holding the powerful to lower standards than it does regular users.

“It’s not fair to have one justice system for the rich and important and one for everyone else, but that’s essentially the route that Facebook has carved out,” said Sophie Zhang, a former data scientist for Facebook who uncovered the inauthentic network. Zhang has come forward to expose the company’s failure to address how its platform is being used to manipulate political discourse around the world.

Facebook’s failure to act against the MP will also raise questions about Facebook’s relationship with the Hindu nationalist party. Facebook has repeatedly treated rule violations by BJP leaders with undue leniency, the Wall Street Journal reported in August 2020.

Since Narendra Modi and the BJP harnessed the power of Facebook and took power in India’s 2014 general election, deceptive social media tactics have become commonplace in Indian politics, according to local experts.

“Politicians in India are ahead of the curve when it comes to adopting these manipulative techniques, and so this leveraging of social media for political means is only to be expected,” said Nikhil Pahwa, an an Indian digital rights activist and founder of MediaNama. “This is an arms race between the social media platforms and those who are generating inauthentic behavior.”

All of the major political parties in India benefit from deceptive techniques to acquire fake likes, comments, shares or fans, Zhang found. Ahead of India’s 2019 general election, she worked on a mass takedown of low-quality scripted fake engagement on political Pages across all parties, resulting in the removal of 2.2m reactions, 1.7m shares and 330,000 comments from inauthentic or compromised accounts.

In December 2019, Zhang detected four sophisticated networks of suspicious accounts that were producing fake engagement – ie likes, shares, comments and reactions – on the Pages of major Indian politicians. Two of the networks were dedicated to supporting members of the BJP, including the MP; the other two supported members of the Indian National Congress, the leading opposition party.

An investigator from Facebook’s threat intelligence team determined that the networks were made up of manually controlled inauthentic accounts that were being used to create fake engagement. They did not rise to the level of “coordinated inauthentic behavior” – the term Facebook applies to the most serious deceptive tactics on its platform, such as the Russian influence operation that interfered in the 2016 US election – but they still violated the platform’s rules.

The investigator recommended that the accounts be sent through an identity “checkpoint” – a process by which suspicious accounts are locked unless and until the account owner can provide proof of their identity. Checkpoints are a common enforcement mechanism for Facebook, which allows users to have just one account, under the user’s “real” name.

On 19 December, a Facebook staffer checkpointed more than 500 accounts connected to three of the networks. On 20 December, the same staffer was preparing to checkpoint the approximately 50 accounts involved in the fourth network when he paused.

“Just want to confirm we’re comfortable acting on those actors,” he wrote in Facebook’s task management system. One of the accounts had been tagged by Facebook’s “Xcheck” system as a “Government Partner” and “High Priority – Indian”, he noted. The system is used to flag prominent accounts and exempt them from certain automated enforcement actions.

It was the MP’s own account, Zhang realized, and its inclusion in the network constituted strong evidence that either the MP or someone with access to his Facebook account was involved in coordinating the 50 fake accounts. (The Guardian is aware of the MP’s identity but is choosing not to reveal it since the evidence of his involvement in the network is not definitive. The MP’s office did not response to requests for comment.)

Political ambitions may explain why an MP would attempt to acquire fake likes on his Facebook posts.

“The worth of a politician is now determined by his social media followers, with Modi leading among most world leaders,” said Srinivas Kodali, a researcher with the Free Software Movement India. “Popularity on social media doesn’t directly help acquire real power, but it has become a means to enter politics and rise up in the ranks.

Task management documents show that Zhang repeatedly sought approval to move ahead with the checkpoints. “For completeness and [to] avoid accusations of biased enforcement, could we also come to an assessment on the cluster acting on [the MP]?” she wrote on 3 February. No one responded.

On 7 August, she noted the still unresolved situation, writing: “Given the close ties to a sitting member of the Lok Sabha, we sought policy approval for a takedown, which we did not receive; and the situation was not deemed to be a focus for prioritization.” Again there was no response.

And on her final day at Facebook in September 2020, she updated the task one last time to flag that there was a “still-existing cluster of accounts associated with” the MP.

“I asked about it repeatedly, and I don’t think I ever got a response,” Zhang said. “It seemed quite concerning to myself because the fact that I had caught a politician or someone associated with him red-handed was more of a reason to act, not less.”

Facebook provided the Guardian with several contradictory accounts of its handling of the MP’s network. The company initially denied that action on the network had been blocked and said the “vast majority” of accounts had been checkpointed and permanently removed in December 2019 and early 2020.

After the Guardian pointed to documents showing that the checkpoints had not been carried out, Facebook said that “a portion” of the cluster had been disabled in May 2020, and that it was continuing to monitor the rest of the network’s accounts. It later said that a “specialist team” had reviewed the accounts and that a small minority of them had not met the threshold for removal but were nevertheless now inactive.

The company did not respond to questions about why the accounts had not been checkpointed in December, when the investigator first recommended the enforcement. It also did not respond to questions about which specialist team was involved in the May review of the accounts, nor why this review and enforcement was not recorded in the task management system. It claimed that the policy team was not responsible for blocking any action.

A Facebook spokesperson, Liz Bourgeois, said: “We fundamentally disagree with Ms Zhang’s characterization of our priorities and efforts to root out abuse on our platform. We aggressively go after abuse around the world and have specialized teams focused on this work. Over the years, our teams investigated and publicly shared our findings about three CIB takedowns in India. We’ve also continuously detected and taken action against spam and fake engagement in the region, in line with our policies.”

While Zhang was trying and failing to convince Facebook to take action on the MP’s network, Facebook’s staff took repeated action against one of the two Indian National Congress networks that it had tried to remove in December. Though the checkpoints had knocked out most of the fake accounts, Facebook saw immediate efforts to reconstitute with new accounts and, in the weeks ahead of the 2020 state elections in Delhi, the network that had previously boosted a Congress politician in Punjab began supporting AAP, the anti-corruption party in Delhi.

In the comments of posts by BJP politicians in Delhi, the fake accounts represented themselves as supporters of Modi who were nevertheless choosing to vote for AAP in the state elections. The intervention may have been a result of political actors attempting to support the party in Delhi with the best chance to defeat the BJP, since Congress enjoys little support in local Delhi politics. Facebook undertook multiple rounds of checkpointing to knock out the network.

The MP’s case was not the first time that Facebook’s lower standards toward politicians violating its rules against inauthentic behavior prompted concern among some staff. “If people start realizing that we make exceptions for Page admins of presidents or political parties, these operators may eventually figure that out and deliberately run their [coordinated inauthentic behavior] out of more official channels,” a researcher said to Zhang during a June 2019 chat about the company’s reluctance to take action against a network of fake accounts and Pages boosting the president of Honduras.

The issue is particularly sensitive in India, where Facebook has come under fire by opposition politicians for allowing BJP politicians to break its rules, particularly with regard to anti-Muslim hate speech.

Facebook’s head of public policy for India, Ankhi Das, overruled policy staff who had determined that the BJP politician T Raja Singh should be designated a “dangerous individual” – the classification for hate group leaders – over his anti-Muslim incitement, according to an August 2020 Wall Street Journal report. Das resigned following the Journal’s reporting on her open support for Modi’s 2014 campaign. Facebook denied any bias or wrongdoing.",1616,10124,17,99
0,India’s COVID Surge Affects the Entire World-The subcontinent was set to vaccinate dozens of other nations. Then its own outbreak spiraled out of control.,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/04/india-covid-surge-vaccine-supply-elections.html,"On Friday, India reached a record of 217,000 COVID-19 infections in 24 hours, far outpacing any other country (and likely still undercounting the total, considering the subcontinent’s long-inadequate testing regime). This week, it surpassed Brazil as the second-most-infected country in the world, and is now only behind the United States in total infection and death rates. Reports of packed hospitals, low oxygen supply, overflowing crematoriums, and the spread of multiple variants abound. As alarming as this is for India itself, the increased global demand for vaccines and the deadly new variants developing within the country pose grave dangers for the rest of the world as well.

The easily transmissible B.1.1.7 strain, which originated in the United Kingdom, took root in the subcontinent as it has elsewhere—but it’s not the only variant of its kind, or even the most worrying. According to data from Johns Hopkins, in the first half of April, the state of Maharashtra not only had the single biggest cluster of new cases within the country, but within the entire Asian continent. Much of this is due to a so-called double mutant, which in India consists of both the easily transmissible strain first found in Brazil and South Africa as well as another mutation that helps the virus sidestep the body’s immune system. Neeraj Kaushik, a professor at the National Institute of Technology, mentioned other troubling features of the variant in a report for the Delhi Police, noting that the variant was infecting younger people, spreading faster among families and groups, avoiding detection in certain tests, and causing new symptoms. The National Institute of Virology in Pune studied hundreds of Maharashtra virus samples from January through March and found that 61 percent of them matched the characteristics of this double mutant. Initially, this mutation had been downplayed by both the state and national governments, despite the fact that it was first detected back in December; on Tuesday, Maharashtra’s chief minister kicked off a 15-day period where only “essential services” would function, though he took care not to refer to it as a lockdown, and also dispatched police to enforce safety measures.

Meanwhile, stories from last year’s pandemic impact are merely repeating themselves. Infections are spreading in other parts of India, like Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh, and states like Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh have either laid down new curfews or extended already-existing curfew hours; Delhi, the single most devastated metropolis, has shut down several business operations, including restaurants, and is also installing a curfew this weekend. Urban low-wage and domestic laborers, cut off from their livelihoods, are leaving in large numbers for their families’ remote villages, very possibly bringing the virus with them. Members of the Lancet COVID-19 Commission Task Force on Public Health are repeatedly urging Indians to take extra safety measures, stating that “vaccines won’t be enough” in the face of variants. Last week, New Zealand banned visitors from India, claiming that the surge it had recently seen at its border (i.e., 23 cases) was spurred mostly by 17 Indian travelers. Other countries have not forbidden flights from India yet, but it could happen soon.

Less than four months ago, the administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi had declared victory over the pandemic and got to work on what’s been projected to be the world’s largest vaccination campaign, approving the manufacture and use of the British AstraZeneca vaccine (branded in India as Covishield) as well as India’s own vaccine, Covaxin, crafted by domestic drugmaker Bharat Biotech. World Trade Organization intellectual property regulations still prevent India from producing generic forms of approved, branded vaccines—a baffling decision for many reasons, not least because the country’s cheap, effective generics are among its biggest exports—yet the country was still determined to not just vaccinate its native population but also give vaccines to its neighbors and allies. This was planned in large part as a counter to geopolitical rival China’s global vaccine distribution campaign. The United States was also happy to partner with India for the purpose of speeding up manufacturing and distribution.

In the first few months of 2021, the vaccine program did seem a startling success, even as COVID cases started to trickle upward (and were subsequently downplayed by the government). By this week, India claimed to have already distributed more than 100 million individual domestic vaccine doses—an impressive number that still wouldn’t even account for 8 percent of India’s population, not to mention that only 11 million people by this point have been fully vaccinated (all the currently available vaccines in India require two shots). The country’s External Affairs Ministry also claimed that, as of Friday, it had exported more than 65 million vaccines to at least 90 countries, mostly to developing nations that have struggled to obtain vaccines.

Yet with the virus still wrecking the country, optimism about India’s recovery has dwindled, and systems are rapidly readjusting. Vaccine rollout has slowed amid the latest surges, putting further benchmarks (including that of vaccinating 250 million “priority people” by July) out of reach and portending a yearslong slog toward herd immunity. Last month, the government halted Covishield exports in order to prioritize the native population; on Tuesday, it announced that it would grant emergency approvals to vaccines being used in other countries, including Russia’s Sputnik V. India is also trying to obtain the Pfizer vaccine, which its government had shrugged off in January after it had refused to sign an indemnity bond—a deal other countries with Pfizer contracts have agreed to—that would have inoculated the company from potential lawsuits over side effects. Moderna appears reluctant to take its product to India, while Johnson & Johnson is in talks with India’s government for a deal on the one-shot vaccine, although its recent pause in the U.S. might spur further skepticism among vaccine-hesitant Indians.

Meanwhile, regional vaccine reception is dependent on the national effort—and there, the rollout is increasingly flailing. At least 10 states have vaccine shortages in their areas, leading to vaccination sites closing down or turning people away; in turn, national leaders are denying that there is a shortage and instead are blaming the states for supposedly poor logistics. India’s Serum Institute, which is producing Covishield, has admitted publicly that its capacity is “very stressed.” Plus, Covaxin production is also bound to slow, in part due to lack of supply of a crucial ingredient sourced from the U.S.; as a result, states like Punjab are missing second doses for those who are on schedule to receive them. These logistical issues are compounding further troubles for Punjabi health officials, who already had trouble persuading vaccine-skeptical seniors to take the shots. And Indian vaccine hesitancy isn’t limited to old age: In other cities, poor urban laborers whose livelihoods were already affected by economic recession are shunning the vaccine, worrying that missing any time for work to get the shots will imperil their employment.

All this was sadly foreseeable. After a messy stay-at-home order in spring 2020 that displaced tens of millions of people from their homes, India never mandated more such large-scale restrictions, and individual states often had to come up with their own responses, with successful results in certain regions and dire ones in others. Throughout the pandemic, Modi and his ideological acolytes have mainly done what they’ve done best over the past seven years: downplay problems, fuel culture wars, and fail to address the consequences of their own policies and statements.

On Monday and Wednesday, 3 million maskless Hindus from across the nation gathered in tight crowds at the Ganga River to observe the Kumbh Mela holiday; hundreds of participants in Monday’s festivities have tested positive for the virus, and almost 200 devotees there were found to already have been positive when they reached the river. There is a notable contrast between the response from the Indian government and its ideological allies to this event and the reaction to Muslims who celebrated at religious events early on in the pandemic. Back in spring 2020, the hashtag #CoronaJihad dominated social media, and Muslims who’d held gatherings were disproportionately blamed for viral spread. Already, the Kumbh Mela case count far exceeds the numbers from Islamic observations, yet there will likely be no comparable uproar.

Religious festivities aren’t the only crowds likely playing a part in viral spread: Local political elections are ramping up. The states of Assam, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu are set to hold elections through the end of the month, despite the lack of distancing in political rallies and tense skirmishes at poll sites. These very states are experiencing high case upticks, yet federal government officials are still prioritizing events in states like West Bengal, whose local elections are being perceived as a referendum on Modi’s conservative Bharatiya Janata Party.

But it’s not just poor public examples that other countries have to fear from India—it’s also the supply of vaccines. India’s Covishield had become an essential part of COVAX, a World Health Organization–backed initiative to get vaccines to lower-income nations; by late March, India had supplied almost 30 million doses for COVAX’s use. With India keeping Covishield totally domestic for now, countries without strong manufacturing bases or health systems that benefited from India’s vaccine generosity will lose out, and the COVAX effort itself will have to slow down. Regions of the world with enhanced vaccine production capacity, including the U.S. and the European Union, remain stingy with vaccine sharing, while a Chinese government official recently cast doubt on the efficacy of his own country’s domestic and exported vaccines. Because of all this, more than 85 of the world’s poorest countries may not have sufficient vaccine access before 2023, according to the Economist. India’s vaccine generosity had helped plug the gap left by other heavyweights, but its domestic reprioritization may now have the unfortunate effect of putting dependent nations at higher risk for viral spread, economic shutdown, and variant emergence. Speaking of variants: Maharashtra’s double mutant has now been found in at least eight other countries. With the rapid global reach of the British, South African, and Brazilian variants, it likely won’t be long before India’s variant also establishes a deadly hold.

The pandemic is far from over in India. Rather, it’s become even more horrifying than before. The rest of the world can’t afford to ignore this.",1790,11590,24,154
0,"Philippines President Duterte urged to end 'policy of subservience' towards China: Duterte has been accused of being silent at a time when Chinese ""maritime militia"" vessels have refused to withdraw the ships from Manila's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the South China Sea.",https://www.aninews.in/news/world/asia/philippines-president-duterte-urged-to-end-policy-of-subservience-towards-china20210417170013/,"Manila [Philippines], April 17 (ANI): As Chinese coast guard ships continue to amass near a disputed reef in the South China Sea, Philippines lawmakers and foreign policy experts called on the country's President Rodrigo Duterte to end the ""policy of subservience"" towards Beijing.

Duterte has been accused of being silent at a time when Chinese ""maritime militia"" vessels have refused to withdraw the ships from Manila's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the South China Sea.

Several Filippino officials, including the country's top diplomat and the defence chief have openly objected to the Chinese provocative actions.

During an address on Thursday night, Duterte did not mention the South China Sea. His spokesman said earlier that the president preferred to pursue his ""diplomatic initiatives"" in ""private"", Al Jazeera reported.

Earlier on Thursday, the Philippine Coast Guard revealed that despite repeated demands by Manila that Chinese ships leave Whitsun Reef, at least 240 Chinese vessels remained in the area and surrounding waters as recently as Wednesday.

Senator Leila de Lima, an opposition member, had warned that the Philippines could become ""just another one of China's satellites"" if Duterte and the military failed to confront China.

De Lima said despite the expression of support by the United States towards Manila's position in the South China Sea, Duterte's ""policy of grovelling before China"" could prove detrimental to the integrity of the Philippine territory.

Since Duterte came to office in 2016, he has nurtured closer ties with China and has openly shown his disdain towards Washington, even threatening to end the US-Philippine military alliance.

Risa Hontiveros, another opposition senator, said it was time for Duterte to confront his ""best friend"" China, for its ""blatant deception"".



""China is truly intent on refusing any diplomatic means of resolving our disputes,"" she said.

Retired Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio, an international law expert, said unless Duterte speaks and defends the country's sovereignty, China will not take the Philippines position seriously.

""He must stand up for himself. Because if his subordinates do the talking, China will not listen. And if the president is silent, then China will continue ... the Chinese will take us seriously if the president will speak,"" Carpio said in an interview with ABS-CBN News Channel on Thursday.

""The maritime militia vessels are manned by the maritime militia under the payroll of the Chinese government. In fact, the maritime militia are placed under the command of the [Chinese] navy,"" he said.

The defence and foreign affairs ministries in the Philippines have been up in arms for a fortnight over the presence of 220 fishing boats suspected to be manned by Chinese maritime militia at Whitsun Reef, with statements flying back and forth over the alleged incursion into the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.

Secretary of Philippines Foreign Affairs Teddy Locsin Jnr said last Wednesday he was ""firing off another diplomatic protest"" to China's embassy and would continue objecting ""every day until the last one's gone like it should be by now if it is really fishing"".

Even after such an intensifying row, China hasn't shown any sign of relocation of the vessels. Instead, they have accused the Philippines of using a 2016 international tribunal ruling, which deprived China of certain outcrops of territorial-generating status, the ruling from the permanent court of arbitration effectively punches holes in China's all-encompassing ""nine-dash"" line that stretches deep into the South China Sea, as reported by the Sydney Morning Herald.

The 2016 International Tribunal Ruling denies China of its thousand years of fishing rights in the area.

China claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea and has overlapping territorial claims with Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Taiwan.

China has been increasing its maritime activities in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea over the past few months, partly in response to Beijing's concerns over the increasing US military presence in the region because of escalating Sino-US tensions.

Beijing's rising assertiveness against counter claimants in the East and South Sea has resulted in unprecedented agreement across the Indo-Pacific. (ANI)

0,NASA selects SpaceX as its sole provider for a lunar lander,https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/04/nasa-selects-spacex-as-its-sole-provider-for-a-lunar-lander/,"In an extraordinary announcement on Friday, NASA said that it has selected SpaceX and its Starship vehicle to serve as the lunar lander for its Artemis Program. This is NASA's plan to return humans to the Moon later this decade.

About a year ago, NASA gave initial study and preliminary development contracts for Moon landers to SpaceX, Dynetics, and a team of aerospace heavyweights led by Blue Origin. The cost of SpaceX's bid was about half that of Dynetics, and one-fourth the amount received by Blue Origin. That frugality, at least in part, led NASA on Friday to choose SpaceX as the sole provider of landing services during the down-select phase.

""We looked at what’s the best value to the government,"" said Kathy Lueders, chief of the human exploration program for NASA, during a teleconference with reporters on Friday.

NASA said it will award SpaceX $2.89 billion for development of the Starship vehicle and two flights. One of these missions will be an uncrewed flight test of Starship down to the lunar surface and back. The second mission will be a crewed flight—the first one of the Artemis program—down to the Moon.

Starship offered several advantages, NASA officials said. It has a spacious cabin for astronauts, two airlocks, and ample payload capability to bring large numbers of experiments to the Moon and return samples to Earth. Significantly, the NASA engineers also praised the vehicle's innovative design and future-looking technology that might also one day be used on Mars.

Ultimately, the selection criteria were based on a company's technical proficiency, management, and cost. SpaceX scored well in all three. But budget appears to have been the biggest factor. The space agency has had difficulty securing funding from Congress for the lunar lander aspect of the program. For the current fiscal year, NASA said it needed $3.3 billion in funding to meet the goal of landing humans on the Moon by 2024. Congress provided just $850 million, and as a result, NASA acknowledged that 2024 was no longer a realistic target.

Making Artemis affordable

At the direction of the Trump administration, NASA formally created the Artemis Program about two years ago to send humans back to the Moon in a sustainable way and establish a base there. The goal was to move beyond the flags-and-footprints forays of the Apollo Program and gain the knowledge needed to eventually send humans to Mars. The Biden administration has endorsed this basic goal, and it's working to update the Artemis Program with a more realistic timeline given the budget predilections of Congress.

Friday's announcement is part of that process of making Artemis more affordable. A sole-source award to SpaceX for the Human Landing System will certainly not be particularly popular in Congress, where traditional space companies such as Lockheed Martin and newer entrants like Blue Origin have more established lobbying power. But it sends a clear message from NASA and the White House to budget writers in the House and Senate.

This award effectively says that NASA is serious about getting to the Moon with the funding it has. And if Congress were to fully fund the Human Landing System program, NASA could bring on a competitor. Ideally, of course, there should be competition. This approach has worked well for NASA's commercial cargo and crew programs. But NASA is getting a small fraction of what it needs to run a lunar lander competition.

In addition to this development award, NASA said it would soon move to procure ""recurring landing services"" from industry. This contract will be for operational missions to the lunar surface, and it seems like SpaceX would have a significant advantage in winning the award. However, there may be an opening here, if Congress provides more funding for the Human Landing System, for either Dynetics or the Blue Origin-led team to play a role in human landings.

Self-funding Starship

SpaceX has largely self-funded development of the large Starship vehicle for about five years, with the intent of using it to settle humans on Mars one day. Starship is a fully reusable upper stage that will launch atop the Super Heavy rocket. SpaceX is in various states of testing and developing both of these vehicles at its facility in South Texas.

As part of the Artemis Program, SpaceX has proposed launching a modified version of its Starship vehicle to lunar orbit. Shortly afterward, a crew of NASA astronauts would launch inside an Orion spacecraft on top of a Space Launch System rocket, both of which were developed by NASA. Orion would rendezvous with Starship in lunar orbit, board the vehicle, and go down to the surface. Starship would then lift off from the lunar surface and link back up with Orion, and the crew would come back to Earth in the smaller capsule.

Left unsaid is the reality that SpaceX is also planning to launch humans on Starship from Earth. It does not seem like all that much of a stretch to question the need for the much more costly Orion and Space Launch System rocket, when lunar crews could simply launch in a Starship into low-Earth orbit, undergo refueling there from another Starship, and then go to the Moon and back. But NASA knows that Congress—which is heavily invested in Orion and the SLS rocket, and their jobs across all 50 states—would not support a SpaceX-only program.

The choice of SpaceX was applauded by some industry officials on Friday. ""The selection of SpaceX as the sole-source developer of the Human Lander System is a sign of how far both the company and their relationship with NASA has come over the last ten-years,"" said Lori Garver, a deputy administrator for NASA under President Obama. ""SpaceX's involvement in Artemis is sure to elevate public interest and will hopefully lead to our soonest possible return to the Moon.""

For years, space industry leaders like Garver have advocated for NASA to increase support for commercial space companies that have sought to drive down the costs of spaceflight. After all, SpaceX's bid for the entirety of its Human Landing System, $2.9 billion, is about what NASA spends each year on the Space Launch System and associated ground systems development. Now, the space agency appears to be boldly embracing such a future.",1044,6292,11,59
1,Rumors Confirmed: IO Interactive Confirms Agent 47’s Barcode Brings Up Del Monte Whole Green Beans When Scanned,https://ogn.theonion.com/rumors-confirmed-io-interactive-confirms-agent-47-s-ba-1846104102,"With the Hitman trilogy finally wrapping up this month, series fans everywhere can celebrate a fittingly badass end to one of gaming’s great stealth antiheroes. But one nagging mystery—the story behind the protagonist’s iconic tattoos—remained unsolved. That is until today, when iO Interactive confirmed a long-rumored theory that scanning Agent 47’s barcode would bring up a can of Del Monte Whole Green Beans.

That’s right. Some of Hitman’s most rabid fans might have guessed it. For the rest of us, though? Mind. Blown.

“Since the series started way back in 2000, we’ve constantly heard from gamers telling us their pet theories about how Agent 47 got his infamous barcode,” said series director Christian Elverdam in a livestream revealing the long-suspected series secret. “Some people thought it had to do with his past links to an international criminal syndicate. Others even thought that 47 got the tattoo while being cloned in some sort of underground laboratory. I don’t know where they think up this stuff.”



“The answer is simple: 47 ’ s neck can be rung up to purchase a can of Del Monte Whole Green Beans for $1.99,” he added.

According to Elverdam, iO Interactive excitedly followed fan theories as they piled up over the years, expressing delight at the way gamers honed in on E aster eggs such as a throwable can of green beans in 2012 ’ s Hitman: Absolution or the countless appearance of Del Monte products in the Miami mission of 2018 ’ s Hitman 2. While several Reddit users came tantalizingly close recently with speculation that Agent 47 ’ s neck could be used to purchase a can of Hormel Baked Beans, it wasn’t until today that the full truth could be appreciated in all its glory.

“What we want fans to imagine is a supermarket cashier slowly sliding Agent 47 ’ s neck over a checkout scanner,” added Elverdam. “Maybe he has to do it four or fives times because the laser is broken and knocks 47 ’ s head against the checkout counter’s metal lip. But when it works, a little line that reads ‘Del Monte Cut GB 28oz’ pops up on the register screen.”

“There’s also this two-for-one deal where you can get any other Del Monte canned vegetable of equal or lesser value for free if you use Agent 47,” he added. “I should have mentioned that before. Sorry.”

It all seems so obvious in retrospect! But we’ve got to admit that this mystery had us stumped until today. Thankfully, this massive reveal just gives us more reason than ever to go back to the beginning of the series and experience Agent 47 ’ s incredible story all over again. Now that’s the kind of pleasant surprise we love to see!

There aren’t any efforts of submitting the ballots of deceased Wisconsin residents or by people trying to vote multiple times that we could see before we tossed them in the trash. This just goes to show that concerns about voter fraud have been way overblown. It’s very encouraging.” Wisconsin officials added that their examination of votes did find a negligible 0.05% of ballots that they were going to count.

(AP Photo/Nic Coury)

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Chris Lambert would like to get back to making music but he can’t seem to stop chasing a ghost that has haunted him for nearly 25 years.

A billboard on the side of the road on California’s Central Coast led him on a detour three years ago from his career as a singer-songwriter and recording engineer. He created a podcast about the 1996 disappearance of college freshman Kristin Smart and it’s taken over his life.

“I can’t step away from it for more than a few days,” Lambert said. “I just get sucked right back in because I want to be resolving things.”

It was an unlikely turn for someone who refers to himself as a shy, “random boy with a beard” and it has produced results he never imagined.

On Tuesday, as San Luis Obispo County Sheriff Ian Parkinson announced arrests , he credited Lambert with helping draw worldwide attention to the case and bringing forward several key witnesses.

The longtime suspect, Paul Flores, and Smart were fellow freshmen at the California Polytechnic State University campus in San Luis Obispo. Now 44, Flores was charged with murder in the killing of the 19-year-old while trying to rape her in his dorm room, prosecutors said.

His father, Ruben Flores, 80, was charged as an accessory after authorities said he helped hide the body, which has never been located.

Paul Flores’ lawyer has declined to comment on the criminal charge. A lawyer for Ruben Flores said his client is innocent.

Lambert has been thrust into the spotlight with the arrests. His eight-part series, “ Your Own Backyard, ” hit 7.5 million downloads Thursday and it was the No. 2 podcast on iTunes. Lambert’s phone has been blowing up with messages — from fans, tipsters and news reporters. He appreciates the attention but has been overwhelmed.

“It’s driving me insane,” he said, yet he remained focused, patient and polite during a 45-minute interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday.

All the attention isn’t leading to any money — Lambert takes no advertising for the podcast, relying on donations.

His is the latest in a line of true-crime podcasts to play a role in an arrest, a court appeal or even an exoneration.

“Up and Vanished” led a man to confess to killing a Georgia beauty queen, while “Serial” helped a convicted murderer win a new trial in Maryland. “In the Dark” unearthed new evidence in a case prosecutors dropped instead of seeking a seventh trial against a Mississippi man who spent decades on death row.

Lambert, 33, was just 8 when Smart vanished a short drive up the coast from his own home in the small town of Orcutt, about 140 miles (225 kilometers) northwest of Los Angeles. It scared him that someone had gone missing and no one knew what happened.

For more than two decades, a billboard featuring a photo of a grinning Smart advertised a $75,000 reward. It’s located in the town of Arroyo Grande. where Paul Flores grew up and his parents still live.

Lambert passed it many times and it ultimately motivated him to start investigating.

“I thought I’d give it a shot and see if I could get a few people talking,” Lambert said. “All I have to do is get over my shyness and start calling these people out of the blue and start asking really personal questions.”

He bought some high-quality recording equipment and began making calls. He located overlooked or reluctant witnesses who hadn’t spoken with police, he said.

People opened up to Lambert and he encouraged them to contact investigators with relevant information. Deputies started calling him to connect them with people he interviewed.

“What Chris did with the podcast was put it out nationally to bring in new information,” Parkinson said without elaborating on the new evidence. “It did produce some information that I believe was valuable.”

A former colleague of Paul Flores’ mother, Susan Flores, told him Mrs. Flores came into work after Memorial Day weekend 1996 — when Smart went missing — saying she didn’t sleep well because her husband had gotten a phone call in the middle of the night and left in his car.

“The speculation has been all along that Paul called his dad in the middle of the night and his dad came up and helped him get rid of Kristin’s body,” Lambert said.

A tenant who lived for a year at Susan Flores’ home told him she heard a watch alarm every morning at 4:20 a.m. Smart had worked as a lifeguard at 5 a.m. at the Cal Poly pool, so it’s possible she set her watch to wake up at that early hour.

“That seems to be the moment in the podcast series that most people have been just completely shaken,” he said. “This may be the piece of evidence that points to the fact that Kristin was buried in that backyard or that her belongings were buried in that backyard.”

Susan Flores, who hung up when called by the AP, told KSBY-TV in March in the only interview she’s granted that she could “shoot a lot of holes into a lot of (Lambert’s) lies.”

She said Lambert never contacted her. He said he sent an intermediary to her house and Susan Flores threatened to call the police. His efforts to speak with Paul Flores were also fruitless, he said.

Lambert spoke with a former Australian exchange student at Cal Poly who said he saw Flores and Smart struggling near where Smart was last seen. Lambert said investigators had dismissed that account in the early years of the probe.

Lambert has developed a close relationship with the Smart family, who issued a statement after the arrest, praising his skills and “unselfish dedication.”

He is grateful to have grown close to the family. He feels like he’s gotten to know Kristin Smart, but wishes he had the chance to meet her.

“For most of my life, Kristin Smart has been a face on a billboard,” he wrote on Instagram. “I’ve learned about Kristin the daughter, Kristin the big sister, Kristin the friend, the neighbor, the roommate. Kristin the swimmer. Kristin the dreamer. And I’ve learned that you can miss a person you never even got to meet.”",1223,7096,8,54

Mr. Traoré, who was 27 at the time, had been troubled by Ms. Halimi’s mezuza, which “amplified the frantic outburst of hate,” according to one psychiatric report.

The verdict, more than four years after the killing, ended judicial proceedings in France for the case. The verdict came after a lower-court ruling rejected a trial, and the Halimi family appealed. President Emmanuel Macron made an unusual personal intervention by calling for the case to have its day in court.

Train tickets to some of the most popular destinations for this year's May Day holiday sold out the moment they became available, causing platforms to temporarily crash, foretelling an explosive holiday season starting on May 1.



According to qunar.com, an online travel agency, train tickets departing on April 30 has already sold out for several popular routes, including from Beijing to beach resort Beidaihe, and from Xi'an in Northwest China's Shaanxi Province to Chengdu in Southwest China's Sichuan. Changsha in Central China's Hunan and Wuhan in Hubei and Chongqing are among the destinations in top demand.



The demand on Friday for booking holiday tickets was so high that the surging traffic caused a temporary crash on the official booking website 12306.com.



""I tried wearing and taking off my glasses, binding and not binding my hair, and walked to the brighter living room to pass the facial recognition check on the app, but failed five or six times,"" a Beijing resident surnamed Zhang told the Global Times on Friday.



""Only when I browsed social media did I realize it wasn't my problem, it was that 12306 was down,"" Zhang said. She was trying to purchase a ticket to her hometown, Luoyang in Central China's Henan Province, which also has many historical sites and tourist spots.



Apart from railway travels, China's domestic civil aviation industry has also come up with a vengeance, based on bookings for the coming holiday. According to the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), the five-day May Day holiday will ""fully release"" the transportation demand in China that had been previously suppressed by the pandemic.



The CAAC estimates that, based on current bookings, both the volume and prices of tickets will significantly surpass the level from the same period in 2019. It also advised that passengers avoid travelling on peak days of the holiday, which fall on first and last days of the May Day holiday; that is, on April 30, May 1 and May 5.



The spike in domestic travel, compared to international flight routes that are still mired in global travel restrictions, has led China's airline companies to shift most of their resources to domestic flights. At the end of March, a total of 322 flight routes were added to the summer and autumn operation seasons.



Tourism and travel have mostly resumed to pre-pandemic levels in China. China's civil flight passenger volume increased 216 percent to 47.8 million trips in March, according to CAAC. Domestic trips in March have recovered to the same level in the same period of 2019, and total trips in Q1 increased 38 percent.



""The worst days for the civil aviation industry have passed,"" market watcher Qi Qi said, ""and with the full recovery of the economy, airline companies are expected to see their profits grow in leaps and bounds as people's demand for domestic travel resumes.""



However, as profits and demand resume, Chinese airlines' ""fly freely"" programs, unveiled during the pandemic, are facing online backlash among consumers, who said that they can't redeem their rewards as promised now that demand is rebounding.

Washington: The Biden administration announced Thursday the US is expelling 10 Russian diplomats and imposing sanctions against several dozen people and companies, holding the Kremlin accountable for interference in last year's presidential election and the hacking of federal agencies.

The sweeping measures are meant to punish Russia for actions that US officials say cut to the core of American democracy and to deter future acts by imposing economic costs on Moscow, including by targeting its ability to borrow money. The sanctions are certain to exacerbate tensions with Russia, which promised a response, even as President Joe Biden said the administration could have taken even more punitive measures but chose not to in the interests of maintaining stability.

“We cannot allow a foreign power to interfere in our democratic process with impunity,” Biden said at the White House.

Sanctions against six Russian companies that support the country's cyber efforts represent the first retaliatory measures against the Kremlin for the hack familiarly known as the SolarWinds breach, with the US explicitly linking the intrusion to the SVR, a Russian intelligence agency. Though such intelligence-gathering missions are not uncommon, officials said they were determined to respond because of the operation's broad scope and the high cost of the intrusion on private companies.

The US also announced sanctions on 32 individuals and entities accused of attempting to influence last year’s presidential election, including by spreading disinformation. US officials alleged in a declassified report last month that Russian President Vladimir Putin authorised influence operations to help Donald Trump in his unsuccessful bid for reelection as president, though there’s no evidence Russia or anyone else changed votes or manipulated the outcome.

The actions, foreshadowed by the administration for weeks, signal a harder line against Putin, whom Trump was reluctant to criticise even as his administration pursued sanctions against Moscow. They are the administration’s second major foreign policy move in two days, following the announcement of troop withdrawals from Afghanistan. Until now, Biden has largely focused on the coronavirus pandemic and economy in his first months in office.

Biden said that when he advised Putin days earlier of the forthcoming measures — which included expulsion of the 10 diplomats, some of them representatives of Russian intelligence services — he told the Russian leader “that we could have gone further but I chose not to do so. I chose to be proportionate.""

“We want,” he said, “a stable, predictable relationship.”

Even so, Russian officials spoke of a swift response, with Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov warning that “a series of retaliatory measures will come in the nearest time.""

Other American measures are expected, though the administration is not likely to announce them. Officials have advised that their response to Russia would be in ways both seen and unseen.

The sanctions are the latest in a series of actions that successive presidential administrations have taken to counter Russian behavior seen as antagonistic. It is unclear whether the new US actions will result in changed behavior, especially since past measures — both Trump and Barack Obama expelled individual diplomats during their presidencies — have failed to bring an end to Russian hacking.

But experts suggest this latest round, even while not guaranteed to curb cyberattacks, might have more resonance because of its financial impact: The order makes it more difficult for Russia to borrow money by barring U.S. banks from buying Russian bonds directly from the Russian Central Bank, Russian National Wealth Fund and Finance Ministry. It could complicate Russian efforts to raise capital and give companies pause about doing business in Russia.

The impact of the sanctions and the US willingness to impose costs will be weighed by Putin, though he is unlikely to make “a 180” degree pivot in his behavior, said Daniel Fried, a former assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs.

“The issue is, how can we push back against Putin’s aggression, while at the same time keeping open channels of communication and continuing to cooperate with Russia in areas of mutual interest,” Fried said. “And it seems to me the Biden administration has done a pretty good job framing up the relationship in exactly this way.”

Eric Lorber, a former Treasury Department official now with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the administration, is “surely trying to balance putting pressure on Russia, pushing back on Russia, while at the same time, not engaging in full-fledged economic warfare.”

The White House did not impose sanctions related to separate reports that Russia encouraged the Taliban to attack US and allied troops in Afghanistan, saying instead that Biden was using diplomatic, military and intelligence channels to respond.

Reports of alleged “bounties” surfaced last year, with the Trump administration drawing criticism for not raising the issue directly with Russia. Administration officials said Thursday they had only low to moderate confidence in that intelligence, in part because of the ways in which the information was obtained, including from interrogations of Afghan detainees.

Among the companies sanctioned are websites US officials say operate as fronts for Russian intelligence agencies and spread disinformation, including articles alleging widespread voter fraud in 2020. The individuals who were targeted include Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian and Ukrainian political consultant who worked with former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and who was indicted in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.

The Treasury Department said Thursday that Kilimnik had provided “sensitive information on polling and campaign strategy” to Russian intelligence services. That went further than Mueller's office, which said in 2019 that it had been unable to determine what Kilimnik had done with the polling data after getting it from the Trump campaign.

Also sanctioned were the Kremlin’s first deputy chief of staff, Alexei Gromov, several individuals linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman with close ties to Russia's president, nicknamed “Putin’s chef” for serving Kremlin functions, and several front companies the US says helped Prigozhin evade sanctions imposed earlier.

The US also sanctioned eight individuals and entities tied to Russia’s occupation in Crimea.

Biden informed Putin that the sanctions were coming earlier this week. Administration officials have made clear in their contacts with the Russia side that they are hoping to avoid a “downward spiral” in the relationship, according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity following the sanctions announcement.

The two leaders had a tense call in which Biden told Putin to “de-escalate tensions” following a Russian military buildup on Ukraine’s border, and said the US would “act firmly in defense of its national interests” regarding Russian intrusions and election interference.

In a television interview last month, Biden replied “I do” when asked if he thought Putin was a “killer.” He said the days of the US “rolling over” to Putin were done. Putin later recalled his ambassador to the US and pointed at the US history of slavery and slaughtering Native Americans and the atomic bombing of Japan in World War II.

US officials are still grappling with the aftereffects of the SolarWinds intrusion, which affected agencies including the Treasury, Justice and Homeland Security departments. The breach exposed vulnerabilities in the supply chain as well as weaknesses in the federal government's own cyber defenses.",1219,8004,18,127

It comes a day after Denmark became the first country in Europe to abandon the jab over links with very rare blood clots.

Both the World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency have said the benefits of the vaccine outweigh its risks.

""There is now significantly more knowledge about the connection between the AstraZeneca vaccine and the rare and serious incidents of low platelets, blood clots and bleeding than when Norway chose to put further use of the AstraZeneca vaccine on pause in March,"" said Geir Bukholm, director of infection control at Norway's National Institute of Public Health.

""Based on this knowledge, we have arrived at a recommendation that the AstraZeneca vaccine be removed from the coronary vaccination programme in Norway.""

On March 11, authorities had suspended the rollout of the vaccine after a small number of people who had received the jab were hospitalised with a combination of blood clots and a low count of platelets, with three cases proving fatal.

Bukholm said that now, with ""significantly more knowledge"" about the connection between the AstraZeneca vaccine and rare incidents of blood clotting and low platelets, Norway should cease use of the vaccine.

The institute estimated that pulling distribution of the AstraZeneca jab would likely bring about a delay in overall vaccine rollout by two weeks.

Bukholm said that it had not been easy to come to that recommendation. However, he suggested he believe it was a necessary step.

Those who have already received the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine are expected to be offered another coronavirus jab as their second dose.

However, the country's public health institute said it would be offering more information on the specifics of the programme in the coming days.",300,1882,12,88

AKRON, OH—Stressing that continuing to watch the animated television series would be worth it in the long run, local man Collin North reportedly assured his friend Brice Mitchell Monday that he just had to stick with The Flintstones through the J.L. Gotrocks arc. “I get it, the whole mistaken-identity thing isn’t exactly the show’s finest hour, but if you can just power through the Gotrocks Corp. stuff, that’s when The Flintstones really takes off,” said North, adding that he definitely didn’t recommend his friend skip the Gotrocks episode since it also laid important groundwork for future story arcs in the series. “It might be a little boring in the thick of Fred and Barney signing up for the army, but ultimately the series is really an intricate tapestry and you have to give the writers room to weave it. Plus then you’ll eventually get to the third season, which is absolutely the golden age of The Flintstones. But those classic episodes like the Fraternal Order of the Water Buffaloes Convention in Frantic City and the heartrending one where Fred hires Lollobrickida the French maid wouldn’t resonate as deeply if it hadn’t been for the careful foundation the Flintstones writers built back in season one. Just wait until season four, when Barney Rubble really comes into his own as a character. Honestly, I’m jealous that you get to watch it for the first time.” North assured his friend that if he stuck with The Flintstones he would also finally understand all the memes their other friends were constantly sending in the group chat.

0,New Brexit checks continued to hamper meat exports in February,https://www.pig-world.co.uk/news/new-brexit-checks-continued-to-hamper-meat-exports-in-february.html,"The introduction of new Brexit checks at the start of the year continued to hamper UK meat exports to the EU in February, new trade figures show.

The Government figures, published on Tuesday, show that overall UK exports to the EU made something of recovery from the slump in January, but volumes remain well below 2020 levels.Total exports from the UK to EU were up 47% on the previous month after a record drop of 42% in January.

After plummeting to just £400m in January, exports of food and live animals recovered to £700m in February, although this remains 29% below the £900m the UK exported to the EU in February 2020.

The data for meat and meat preparations showed an even larger deficit, with exports to the EU down 42% on the previous year:

Feb 2019: £115m

Feb 2020: £113m

Feb 2021: £66m

(Export value to the EU of Meat and Meat Preparations, Office of National Statistics, 13 April 2021)

In January, pork exports to the EU fell by a staggering 84%, amounting to just 2,500 tonnes, a reduction of 13,000 tonnes year on year. As a result, overall pig meat (including offal) shipments fell by nearly a half compared with 2020 to only 15,600 tonnes.

NPA Senior Policy Adviser, Charlie Dewhirst, said: “Obviously it’s encouraging to see exports recover from the dire situation in January but we are still a long way short of previous trade numbers.

“The pandemic will still be affecting export opportunities but there is plenty more work to do to tackle the systemic problems. We need to improve and modernise our trading processes with the EU to help the pig sector recapture the export market and sell our world class produce on the Continent.”

Live exports

Live pig exports are still not possible due to the lack of border infrastructure at the Channel ports. NPA senior policy adviser Rebecca Veale told BBC Farming Today how the inability to trade live animals with the EU is damaging the UK pig sector.

She was interviewed as part of a feature about how the new requirement for Border Control Posts (BCP) to inspect animals exported from and imported to the UK is causing disruption across the livestock sectors.

You can listen to the feature HERE (from 3.30 mins)

Questioned about the impact on pigs, Rebecca said: “Unfortunately, on the routes through seaports we would use, there are currently no Border Control Posts.”

She highlighted how BCPs were an issue for individual companies and not something EU Governments had control over. She said the NPA was ‘working really hard’ with some countries who are interested in putting a BCP in place, but stressed, while progress is being made, none are accepting live animals.

“For the pig industry in the UK, it is really important that we export breeding animals. There are a small number of breeding companies and the ability for them to operate in this country and abroad is of relevance to all producers.”

Mr Dewhirst updated the NPA’s Pig Industry Group on the search for new BCPs at EU ports at its latest meeting.

A possible site has been found inland near Calais, although it still needs approval from the French authorities and Brussels. Other options include the Hook of Holland and Zeebrugge. However, none of the facilities have yet been constructed, so it is likely to be some time before exports can resume.

The need for BCPs to check live pigs coming into the UK from the EU has been delayed until the start of 2022 – various possible sites have been identified.

Vjosa Osmani says justice for the 13,000 people killed in the conflict, the one million displaced or expelled and the 1,600 who are still missing, must be the foundation for a long-sought deal to normalise relations with Serbia, which is a condition for both Balkan states to eventually join the European Union.

The US-educated lawyer also accuses her counterpart in Belgrade, Aleksandar Vucic, of sharing the expansionist mindset of Slobodan Milosevic, the nationalist Serbian leader whose belligerence was a catalyst for the wars that destroyed Yugoslavia in the 1990s, and whom he served as information minister.

Osmani’s stance will raise hackles in Serbia, but she says Kosovo is ready to wait years if necessary for a “quality” deal that secures Belgrade’s recognition of Kosovo’s independence without any changes to its current borders.

“Our main job is to speak on behalf of the victims and their families. So the missing persons are our number one priority,” says Osmani, who as a teenager trekked hundreds of kilometres with fellow Kosovars to seek safety from a brutal Serbian crackdown on separatist rebels fighting to end Belgrade’s rule over Kosovo.

“Also war reparations for all the destruction that Serbia caused in Kosovo, and not just during the war but since 1989, when Milosevic came to power and led an apartheid-like system in our country,” she says. “And finally justice, which is a precondition for peace.”

Kosovo’s parliament elected Osmani (38) as president last week, with the backing of prime minister Albin Kurti and his Vetevendosje (Self-Determination) party.

Their alliance in February’s national election and focus on “jobs and justice” for Kosovo’s 1.8 million people secured a landslide victory, and Osmani’s own tally of 300,000 votes has confirmed her status as the nation’s most popular politician.

She says Kosovo’s leaders are now analysing the history of its EU-brokered talks with Serbia, so as to gear future negotiations towards improving the lives of Kosovo’s people and securing “the key component” – mutual recognition between Kosovo and Serbia and their current borders.

“There is no price and no pressure that would make us give up or give in with respect to those principles ... We are going to sit at that table [with Serbia] precisely so we can look in their eyes, so that they can ask for forgiveness for crimes that were committed,” she says.

Claims of genocide She is convinced that those crimes, which she describes as “beyond human imagination”, constitute not only ethnic cleansing but genocide: “The will and intention of Serbia to exterminate, to destroy a people based on their nationality, was clear.”

“So we will be preparing as a country for a genocide case against Serbia as soon as we are ready for that, legally and in terms of the evidence ... The witnesses, most of them are still alive, and the evidence is there and it’s clear-cut,” she said.

Kosovo’s newly elected president, Vjosa Osmani, with her husband and their twin daughters attend the presidential handover ceremony. Photograph: Visar Kryeziu/AP Photo Osmani does not say which court could hear such a case, and legal experts note the difficulty of proving that a state committed genocide.

An international court convicted Bosnian Serb military and political officials of committing genocide against Bosnian Muslims at Srebrenica in 1995, but the United Nations’ highest court ruled that while Serbia had failed in its duty to prevent genocide there, it was not directly responsible for the massacre.

Serbia’s official commemoration of the Kosovo war focuses on Serbian victims of Nato bombing that forced Milosevic to end his crackdown in June 1999, and left Kosovo under UN administration until it declared independence in 2008.

Serbian courts have not launched a significant new trial related to the Kosovo conflict in several years, existing cases are beset by long delays, and Serbs convicted of war crimes by international tribunals are often welcomed home as heroes.

“So when the time comes for the Kosovo delegation to sit with the president of Serbia, our very first question will be: where are our loved ones?” Osmani says of the 1,600 people still missing from the Kosovo war.

Defending Milosevic Vucic has admitted making mistakes in his political past without clearly denouncing Milosevic and his dream of “Greater Serbia”. In 2018, he said Milosevic “was a great Serbian leader whose intentions were certainly for the best, but our results were very poor”.

Vucic and Kosovo’s previous president, Hashim Thaci, were widely reported to have considered a “land swap” as part of a Serbia-Kosovo deal, despite warnings that changing borders in the Balkans could ignite violence. Thaci, who was a leader of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, is now awaiting trial at a war crimes court in the Hague.

Osmani says an exchange of territory is impossible, and believes Vucic “is yet to prove that he has broken away from the past mindset of Milosevic”.

“I think he is pursuing a similar strategy through different means; obviously not through war and destruction and violence but through a different strategy, which still aims at grasping more territories and doesn’t really care about the fate of the people.”

A first meeting with Vucic may be some way off, and Osmani says her current priority is to source Covid-19 vaccines for a country that has received just 24,000 doses.",919,5656,9,61

🇬🇧 UN Human Rights Chief @mbachelet urges UK Parliament to amend proposed law that risks undermining key human rights obligations by shielding military personnel operating abroad from accountability for torture and other war crimes.

“As currently drafted, the Bill would make it substantially less likely that UK service members on overseas operations would be held accountable for serious human rights violations amounting to international crimes”, the High Commissioner said.

Shielded from probes

The Bill could shield military personnel operating abroad “from due accountability for acts of torture or other serious international crimes”, she maintained.

In its present form, the UN rights chief also said that the legislation potentially put it at odds with the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the Convention against Torture.

And quoting from the UK Government’s background to the Bill, Ms. Bachelet highlighted that the purpose of the Bill was “to provide greater certainty for Service personnel and veterans in relation to claims and potential prosecution for historical events that occurred in the complex environment of armed conflict overseas”.

Raising the bar

In future, prosecutors would have to “have proper regard to the challenging context…in relation to alleged historical incidents that occurred on overseas operations”, the UN High Commissioner continued, while noting that the Government had been in contact with her office, OHCHR, over the issue.

“I appreciate the Government’s engagement with my Office on these issues. I also note that similar concerns have been raised by numerous politicians, NGOs, lawyers and former senior British military officers, as well as by the UN Committee against Torture and a group of UN Special Rapporteurs, including the Special Rapporteur on Torture,” Ms. Bachelet said.

The Bill is now reaching its final stages in the legislative process and will shortly be debated for a third and final time by the House of Lords, the UK’s upper house, where amendments may still be made.

0,"In a Russia-NATO War, Missiles Would Destory All of Europe",https://nationalinterest.org/blog/reboot/russia-nato-war-missiles-would-destory-all-europe-183030,"In the event of a military conflict over the Baltic States, Russian missiles in Kaliningrad could target NATO troops heading from Poland.

Here's What You Need to Remember: Air defenses ring Russia’s Western periphery. S-300 and S-400 anti-aircraft missiles cover half of Poland and overlap in concentric circles over the Baltic States — requiring NATO to neutralize these sites during a conflict before its aircraft could provide cover for Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.

The first of 3,500 American troops began rolling into Poland for a nine-month-long mission starting on Jan. 8, 2017. It was an unprecedented length of time for a U.S. armored unit to stay in Eastern Europe. The U.S. Army’s 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division were heading to Zagan and Pomorskie, with the unit’s 87 M-1 Abrams tanks following on trains.

It’s the beginning of a bulked-up and continuous NATO troop rotation to counter a resurgent Russia. In addition to the tanks, the unit is bringing with it 18 self-propelled Paladin howitzers, hundreds of Humvees, and 144 Bradley fighting vehicles which will spread out across Eastern Europe.

At the time, there hadn’t been a U.S. military deployment in Europe this big since the Cold War.

But as the troops moved beyond Zagan, they fell under the shadow of Russia’s land-based strike missiles in Kaliningrad, the Connecticut-sized enclave squeezed between Poland, Lithuania, and the Baltic Sea. Russia has invested heavily in building up its military presence there in recent years.

In the event of a military conflict over the Baltic States, Russian missiles in Kaliningrad could target NATO troops heading from Poland. That could slow reinforcements were Russia to invade Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.

The Baltics would need those NATO reinforcements to have a chance, slim as it would be, to stop a vastly more numerous Russian army. Indeed, Russia’s army is smaller than it once was, but it is “more than adequate … to overwhelm whatever defense the Baltic armies might be able to present,” a RAND Corporation study noted in 2016.

Kaliningrad’s missiles pose a serious complication to NATO. The enclave is practically loaded with them.

Russia/NATO A2AD

For a visual illustration, here’s an interactive map — larger version here — showing these missile “bubbles” indicating the range of various weapons in Europe. The map was produced by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank.

The map can display the ranges of various Russian land attack, air defense, and naval strike weapons near its borders. It’s not comprehensive and there are fixed points of reference for naval weapons — which, of course, would vary in location during an actual conflict.

For NATO, you can select options to show the range of the alliance’s land-attack naval weapons and its air defenses, along with the location of key PODS — or ports of debarkations — where the alliance could land reinforcements by air and sea.

While none of this information is new, it is humbling when displayed graphically. Russian Iskander M ballistic missiles, packing 1,500-pound high-explosive warheads, can reach hundreds of miles into Poland. The entirety of the Baltic States, of course, are within range.

The NATO base at Zagan is just on the edge of the Iskander M’s envelope.

On multiple occasions in 2015 and 2016, Russian warships launched SS-N-30 Kalibr cruise missiles from the Caspian Sea into Syria, requiring the missiles to travel from 1,000 miles away. Similar to the U.S. Tomahawk cruise missile, the Kalibrs could likewise reach most of Europe from ships in the Black Sea, the Baltic or from beyond the Arctic Circle.

Russia’s navy has declined since the Soviet era and is best suited today for coastal defense and regional power projection, but the Kremlin doesn’t need a large navy to fulfill these objectives. In the Caspian, Russia relied on small, Buyan-class missile boats to fire the Kalibrs, which Russia also keeps in its Baltic Sea Fleet.

Air defenses ring Russia’s Western periphery. S-300 and S-400 anti-aircraft missiles cover half of Poland and overlap in concentric circles over the Baltic States — requiring NATO to neutralize these sites during a conflict before its aircraft could provide cover for Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.

But the map also displays Russia’s clear vulnerabilities.

NATO warships with Tomahawk missiles could easily reach Russia’s biggest cities — and strike the center of government power — from a considerable distance away.

In short — war would be chaotic, brutal, and terrible.

0,"European car manufacturers linked to illegal deforestation: Carmakers like VW, BMW, Daimler, PSA and Renault have been linked to Amazon rainforest deforestation in a new study. It said the firms may be using leather from cattle raised on illegally deforested land for their seats",https://www.dw.com/en/amazon-rainforest-european-car-manufacturers-linked-to-illegal-deforestation-says-report/a-57225234,"Car seats from manufacturers like Volkswagen, BMW, Daimler, the PSA group (Peugeot, Citroen, Opel) and Renault could be linked to deforestation, the Rainforest Foundation Norway reported on Friday.

As the leading exporter of bovine leather, Brazil provides about 30% of this material to the global automotive industry. But before turned into car upholstery, the leather may have been removed from cattle raised on land in the Amazon rainforest that was deforested, possibly illegally.

""The purpose of the report is to give an overview of a sector that needs to be studied and that needs transparency,"" Joana Faggin, the study’s lead author, told DW. ""At the moment, no manufacturer can prove that it is not involved in this.""

The pace of deforestation is picking up. Last year, the Amazon rainforest lost 11,088 square kilometers (4,280 square miles) of land, the largest area cleared over a yearlong period within the last 12 years, according to Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research, INPE.

Cattle farming continues to be the motor driving the logging. More than 90% of deforestation is illegal, and a majority of that land is used for grazing, according to the Brazilian conservation NGO Imazon. Following the path of the animals that are raised on this land is a massive challenge.

""If European consumers want to know where the leather comes from, they will face many difficulties,"" said Faggin. ""This industry has a complex supply chain. It’s very difficult to follow the path of the product after the slaughterhouse.""

Leather follows an obscure route

To understand the origins of the leather the manufacturers use, the study delved into complex network of international commerce between Brazil and major importers around the world. It mapped these relations using company documents, studies detailing environmental crimes committed by Brazilian cattle farms, and information on Panjiva, a global trade database.



The analysis identified three primary export routes: Brazil to Asia (China, Indonesia and Thailand); Brazil to North America (Mexico and the United States); and Brazil to Europe (Italy, Germany and Slovenia).

To get from the Brazilian tanneries to the European car manufacturers, the raw material mostly passes through Italy. At this point, it is still chrome-tanned leather, known as wet blue.

After another round of processing, the material is sold on to car seat factories. The Czech Republic and Germany make up 22% and 13% of this global market, respectively. Here, the seats are finalized and then delivered to the car manufacturers.

According to the study, buyers can't be sure that material from major Brazilian suppliers didn't come from deforested areas.

""On the contrary, this report shows a high probability that deforestation is a factor in the leather supply chain,"" the document said.

Most of the material exported from Brazil comes from tanneries in the nine states in the Amazon basin, which use leather from cattle raised and slaughtered in the region.

The biggest suppliers to the European industries — JBS Couros, Minerva Couros, Vancouros, Fuga Couros, Durlicouros, Mastrotto Brasil and Viposa — all have some sort of link to deforestation, though it may not necessarily be illegal, according to the study.

Suppliers cheating the system?

The starting point in tracing the origins of the leather is the cattle. In Brazil, which has the world's biggest cattle herd with about 214 million cows, this path could prove difficult.

Half of these animals are raised in the Amazon, on land that encroaches on the forest. Many suppliers here cheat environmental laws to hide that they are selling cattle raised in deforested spaces and protected areas.

The most common practice translates to ""cattle washing,"" which means transferring the animals from illegal farms to legal farms before making the final sale, which evades the monitoring systems. The cows are then sent on to meat companies.

Making leather from Mexican cacti How it all began Two Mexican entrepreneurs, Adrian Lopez Velarde and Marte Cazarez, have developed the world's first vegan leather from the nopal cactus. Before hitting upon the idea for their alternative to animal leather the duo worked in the furniture, automotive and fashion industries, where they were exposed to animal cruelty.

Making leather from Mexican cacti Traditional leather According to animal rights group PETA, the global leather industry slaughters more than a billion animals and tans their skins and hides every year. Most leather produced and sold in the US is made from the skins of cattle and calves, but some is derived from sheep, lambs, goats and pigs.

Making leather from Mexican cacti The potential of plants The cactus-based material, which is known as Desserto, is similar to its animal counterpart in terms of flexibility, breathability and durability. As such, it could be a potential game-changer for the leather industry. It is partially biodegradable, although not completely because it contains some plastic.

Making leather from Mexican cacti Cacti in their natural habitat The cactus chosen for the leather — which grows in the central Mexican state of Zacatecas — is very resilient and strong and can survive in low winter temperatures. In the quest to remain pesticide-free and use little water, the entrepreneurs rely on rain and minerals abundant in the soil of Zacatecas to sustain their plants.

Making leather from Mexican cacti A cactus that doesn't hurt Although cacti can be hard on the hands, the thorns of the nopal cactus, which is also known as the prickly pear, are small enough for farmers to harvest them without too much difficulty. Once the mature leaves have been cut, they are dried under the sun for three days until they contain the right amount of water needed for successful processing.

Making leather from Mexican cacti A new challenge for the desert ecosystem The team only selects and cuts the leaves without damaging the cactus itself. This process enables them to re-harvest from the plants, which can also be used in Mexican cooking, every six-eight months.

""Everybody, including these companies, knows that the problem lies with the indirect suppliers. Even though the big companies have signed an agreement to stop this, none of them have made much progress in monitoring indirect suppliers,"" said Faggin.

Although the clandestine practice is well-known, companies that buy cattle from the Amazon have done little to minimize the risk, according to Paulo Barreto, a researcher with NGO Imazon.

The institute has developed a methodology that measures the degree of deforestation for each meat company in the region. It bases the measurement on the place where the cattle is bought, the distance of the meat company from the farm, and if there are highways nearby, among other information.

What leather exporters say

Of the seven exporters cited in the report, four replied to DW at the time of writing.

JBS, a giant in the meat and byproduct industry, denied any connection to deforestation, citing an online tool with which one can trace the source of its leather, JBS 360.

The company said it is dealing with the problem of illegal products from indirect suppliers with a platform called Transparent Livestock. Launched in 2020, it extends the ""reach to monitor the suppliers of its suppliers,"" and will bring a ""definitive solution"" by 2025.

Minerva said it signed a commitment to eliminate illegal deforestation from its supply chain, and that it plans on integrating a new tool ""to its geographic monitoring system of the Amazon that assesses the risks related to farms that are indirect suppliers."" The timeline is not clear.

The company, however, said it remains a challenge to accurately trace the origin of the leather. But it maintained that it has a tracking system for the material once it leaves the meat companies and tanneries to guarantee the source of ""100% of the leather processed in its facilities in Brazil.""

Vancouros and Viposa said they have policies and certifications in place to track their raw material.

What manufacturers say

Responding to the report, Volkswagen criticized its alleged inaccuracies.

""For the brands in the Volkswagen Group, we can state: Leather from Brazil is usually chrome-tanned. However, the Volkswagen Group only uses chrome-free tanned leather in Europe,"" it said.

The manufacturer said it has ""written agreements"" from all its suppliers that none of their material can be linked to illegal deforestation in the Amazon.

BMW said it had the same guarantee from its suppliers. Brazilian leather currently represents 5% of its total stock, according to the company.

""It will account for 1% at the end of next year. This will decrease to 0% in the medium term as we restructure our leather supply chains and no longer rely on leather from South America,"" it said in a statement.

Daimler (top), BMW and VW are among the German car manufacturers cited in the report

Daimler, which produces Mercedes-Benz, said it demands in its contracts with suppliers that the products not be connected to illegal deforestation.

PSA preferred not to give a statement until it had access to the full report, while Renault did not respond to a request for comment.

More certification, international pressure needed

Some exporters said they used the Leather Working Group (LWG), which provides internationally accepted environmental certification for ethical leather manufacturers. But the organization may have some limitations in guaranteeing the origins of its material, according to the Rainforest Foundation Norway.

""The supplier provides a declaration to the LWG saying it has no connection to deforestation. There is no rigorous verification,"" Faggin said about the certification process.

The authors of the report said the automotive industry is complicit if it continues to buy raw materials coming from deforested areas in the Amazon.

""It is highly likely that all of the big five car manufacturers in Europe are sourcing leather from Brazilian companies linked to deforestation,"" the study said.

Paulo Barreto of NGO Imazon said it's important that the issue be in the international spotlight.

""Monitoring where leather comes from is even more complicated than for meat. We had some changes because of international pressure, but they are too small given the magnitude of the problem,"" he said. ""Much more effort is needed.""",1717,10777,44,279

Joe Biden? What the hell is going on?” said California governor Gavin Newsom, echoing concerns several other convention speakers had confided to reporters that basically anyone else would have been a better choice to close out the convention than the six-term Delaware senator. “This whole event is supposed to be about inspiring people about the future, and with all due respect to the former vice president, giving him a big speaking spot just isn’t going to cut it. I can see putting him in somewhere in the middle on one of the earlier nights, like right before Billie Eilish performs or maybe have him do a short pre-recorded 30-second clip where he talks about how he loves the country or some shit like that. There’s going to be all this momentum building with the earlier speakers, and then they expect Joe goddamn Biden is going to bring it all home? Give me a fucking break.” Several Democratic speakers told reporters they were still holding out hope that Biden would drop out of his speaking slot before the evening and it could be given to someone better.

""I have to be very clear in this: the Brazilian authorities' negligence is costing lives.""

—Dr. Christos Christou, MSF

""After accounting for over a quarter of global Covid-19 deaths last week, Brazil does not have an effective plan in place to deal with the pandemic,"" the international medical charity, known by its French acronym, MSF, charged in a blog post.

""The pandemic in the country has become politicized, and the government has not adopted science-based measures to try to bring it under control,"" the group said, referring to the administration of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro—who has dismissed Covid-19 as a ""little flu"" while refusing to follow or promote mask-wearing, quarantines, and social distancing despite having contracted the virus last year. Bolsonaro has also encouraged large gatherings and disparaged vaccines.

""The lack of political will to adequately respond to the pandemic is killing Brazilians in their thousands,"" said MSF. ""Last week, Brazilians accounted for 11% of the world's Covid-19 infections and 26.2% global Covid-19 deaths. On 8 April, 4,249 deaths from Covid-19 were recorded in a single 24-hour period, alongside 86,652 new Covid-19 infections.""

According to Johns Hopkins University's global coronavirus tracker, nearly 362,000 people have died of Covid-19 in Brazil, trailing only the United States and its more than 565,000 deaths.

""Last week, intensive care units were full in 21 out of 27 of Brazil's capitals,"" said MSF. ""In hospitals across the country there are ongoing shortages of both oxygen, needed to treat patients who are severely and critically ill, as well as sedatives, needed to intubate critically ill patients. As a result, our teams have seen patients, who may have otherwise had a chance at survival, being left without appropriate medical care.""

""Public health measures have become a political battlefield in Brazil. As a result, science-based policies are associated with political opinions, rather than the need to protect individuals and their communities from Covid-19.""

—Christou

Pierre Van Heddegem, emergency coordinator for MSF's Covid-19 response in Brazil, said that ""not only are patients dying without access to healthcare, but medical staff are exhausted and suffering from severe psychological and emotional trauma due to their working conditions.""

MSF international president Dr. Christos Christou said that ""public health measures have become a political battlefield in Brazil. As a result, science-based policies are associated with political opinions, rather than the need to protect individuals and their communities from Covid-19.""

""The Brazilian authorities have overseen the unmitigated spread of Covid-19,"" Christou continued. ""Their refusal to adapt evidence-based public health measures has sent too many to an early grave. The response in Brazil needs an urgent, science-based reset.""

Driving home his point once again during a Thursday press conference, Christou added: ""I have to be very clear in this: the Brazilian authorities' negligence is costing lives.""",557,3714,9,84

Liaison Office Director Luo Huining gave no details but said Beijing has always been “true to its word and resolute in its deeds” in ensuring national security.

“Now that we have a law, a mechanism, and a team, the implementation is ever more important,” said Luo. “For all who endanger national security, hard resistance should be stricken down by law, soft resistance should be regulated by law.”

More than 100 people have been arrested since Beijing in June last year imposed a national security law on Hong Kong, mandating punishments of up to life imprisonment. The Chinese and Hong Kong governments say foreign forces conspired to encourage the months-long anti-government protests in 2019, a claim denied by pan-democrats.

Some western nations have imposed sanctions on mainland and Hong Kong officials in response to the security legislation and a sweeping political overhaul designed to ensure only “patriots” rule Hong Kong.

In a rare public appearance at the ceremony, Director of the Office for Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong Zheng Yanxiong thanked the legal sector for its support: “I have to especially thank the friends in the legal sector who resolutely supported the implementation of the national security law,” said Zheng.

“Judges, prosecutors, lawyers, and scholars, they all made professional contributions by speaking justly and acting proactively in legal events, with the moral recognition of national security, a serious attitude towards the rule of law, and legal responsibility towards social order.”

Zheng, who was appointed director in July last year, was known for a hardline approach that stamped out anti-corruption protests in Wukan, a village in Guangdong province, in 2011.

Zheng also described the Hong Kong administration, especially the disciplined services, as the city’s “guardian angels” in maintaining national security and prosperity.

Legislative efforts ‘demonised’

In her opening speech, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said national security and regime security were inseparable. “To genuinely secure national security, the right to rule must be tightly gripped in the hands of patriots.”

Lam said legislative efforts to maintain national security had been “demonised by individuals with ulterior motives” since the 1997 handover, making Hong Kong a gap in China’s national security.

Meanwhile, Most of Hong Kong’s newspapers carried front-page government advertisements promoting Thursday’s National Security Education Day, with the exception of the pro-democracy Apple Daily.

The sometimes-violent protests which gripped the city for months in 2019 and early 2020 have subsided since the start of the Covid pandemic and the passing of the National Security Law. Meetings of more than four people are still banned under pandemic regulations.

But the League of Social Democrats and the Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China staged a four-person protest in Wan Chai demanding full democracy. They also called for political prisoners to be released and for human rights to be respected.",533,3506,19,122

The review does not recommend suspending any weapons sales to the United Arab Emirates. That fact emerged on Monday, after the Justice Department formally notified lawyers about the decision, which officials say was made this year as part of a lawsuit opposing the agreement brought by the nonprofit New York Center for Foreign Policy Affairs.

The Emirates played a big role in the Yemen war but stepped back recently. As part of negotiations last year to try to persuade the Emirates to normalize relations with Israel, the Trump administration told Emirati officials that it would accelerate approval of sales of F-35 fighter jets and drones.

U.S. officials said on Wednesday that Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken received the report this week from other offices in the State Department, and that he was expected to approve it. The report would then go to the National Security Council for final approval.

“I and many other House members remain concerned about the proposed sale of $23 billion in arms to the U.A.E.,” said Representative Gregory W. Meeks, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He said he had “many questions about any decision by the Biden administration to go forward with the Trump administration’s proposed transfers” of the fighter jets, drones and munitions to the Emirates.

Israeli officials and some members of Congress have expressed concerns that the sales of F-35s would weaken what they called Israel’s “qualitative military edge” over other countries in the region, and that Congress requires presidential administrations to maintain it as a matter of law. Israel is currently the only country in the region with F-35s.

Other U.S. officials have been concerned about selling the F-35, one of the military’s most advanced pieces of hardware, to the United Arab Emirates when it is developing a closer relationship with China, which is notorious for technological espionage. American officials are worried about the radar and stealth abilities of F-35s and some drone technology, among other things.",386,2415,12,64

The big picture: Sullivan also defended President Biden for not mentioning Navalny in a Thursday speech about Russia or in a Tuesday call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying the White House aims to deal with the issue ""privately and through diplomatic channels.""

Biden denounced Navalny's arrest as ""totally, totally unfair"" and ""totally inappropriate"" on Saturday, according to a pool report.

Where it stands: Navalny — Putin's fiercest and most organized domestic political critic, who previously attempted a run for president in 2018 — faces possible kidney failure as he continues his multi-week hunger strike.

Prison authorities said they offered Navalny treatment, but he refused, arguing he should be seen by a doctor of his choice. That request was denied.

""People usually avoid the word 'dying'. But now Alexey is dying. In his condition, it is a matter of days,"" tweeted the opposition leader's press secretary Kira Yarmysh on Saturday.

What he's saying: Sullivan did not specify what actions the U.S. would take against the Kremlin over Navalny's potential death, saying: ""We are looking at a variety of different costs that we would impose ... but we have communicated that there will be consequences if Mr. Navalny dies.""",227,1456,12,75

SCHAUMBURG, IL—In an ultimately futile act some have described as courageous and others have called a mere postponing of the inevitable, existentialist firefighter James Farber delayed three deaths Monday.

""I'm no hero,"" Farber said after rescuing the family from a house fire on the 2500 block of West Thacker Street, and prolonging for the time being their slow march toward oblivion. ""Like any other man, I am thrown into this world, alone and terrified, to play a meaningless role in an empty life. In my case, that role happens to involve charging through towering blazes to pull helpless individuals from a sea of flames before they suffocate or are burnt alive.""

Added Farber, ""That hardly makes me a paragon of virtue.""

At 2:30 a.m. Monday, the alarm sounded at Farber's station house, causing the despondent firefighter to emerge from a deep malaise and, though still absorbed by the sense of dread that has preoccupied him since youth, respond promptly to the request for assistance at the home of Stanley and Joyce Morgenstern.

According to department officials, Farber, a 13-year veteran of Ladder Company 8, climbed through a kitchen window and, despite carrying with him a heavy burden of alienation, managed to see all three members of the family to safety.

""He came out the front door with a body slung over each shoulder, and seconds later there was this big fireball and beams started falling and the whole thing caved in,"" neighbor Judy Neal said. ""When it was all over, he just sort of stood there emotionless and silent, as if nothing had happened at all.""

""I think I even saw him shrug,"" she added.

While acknowledging that the Morgenstern family no longer has a home, authorities said it really makes no sense to bemoan this fact, as things like this happen every day, and it's no use trying to pretend that, in and of itself, existence is anything but a provisional circumstance over which we exert limited control.

Though the cause of the fire remains unknown, and can perhaps never truly be known, sources close to the investigation said that no foul play is suspected, only the haphazard, amoral processes inherent in nature itself.

""The house will be rebuilt, or perhaps it won't,"" Farber said of the destruction. ""Perhaps an entirely new building will be built there, one that's not even a house. Or maybe it will remain a vacant lot, and a tree will grow there, and some day, long after I and everyone I know has died, young children will come here and play in its branches.""

Farber became a firefighter in 1997, although he stresses that he could just as easily have ended up a baker, an attorney, or a parking garage attendant, depending on whether or not circumstances led him to find himself in such a life.

As for the ultimate consequences of his actions Monday, Farber said they will forever remain uncertain.

""The family has thanked me repeatedly, especially for saving the life of their only child, but their gratitude ignores the full, crushing weight of reality,"" said Farber, his brow furrowed. ""The world may have all kinds of torture in store for that kid, misery that could have been avoided if not for me.""

""I tried to explain to them that what I did was really nothing more than an expression of despair, and thus absurd, but they just kept saying 'thank you, oh my God, thank you, thank you so much,'"" Farber continued.

With local residents applauding the rescue as an inspiring act of bravery, Farber acknowledged to reporters that entering a burning building and knowing you may never come out is indeed a scary thing. But, he argued, it takes far more courage to face down the fear that comes each day from the horrifying and inescapable knowledge that, at any given moment, a man has the complete freedom to simply pour gasoline all over himself, strike a match, and let himself burn.

When asked if he felt something, anything, after briefly extending the lives of three human beings, Farber replied in the negative.

""I was doing what, at that moment, I was doing,"" he said. ""Tomorrow, if there is another fire, I will do the same. Perhaps in that fire, I will be the one who is killed. Or, on the other hand, perhaps I will not. Either way, there will be anguish and sorrow at some unknown point.""

Scientists have successfully grown monkey embryos containing human cells for the first time — the latest milestone in a rapidly advancing field that has drawn ethical questions.

In the work, published on 15 April in Cell1, the team injected monkey embryos with human stem cells and watched them develop. They observed human and monkey cells divide and grow together in a dish, with at least 3 embryos surviving to 19 days after fertilization. “The overall message is that every embryo contained human cells that proliferate and differentiate to a different extent,” says Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, a developmental biologist at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California, and one of the researchers who led the work.

Researchers hope that some human–animal hybrids — known as chimaeras — could provide better models in which to test drugs, and be used to grow human organs for transplants. Members of this research team were the first to show in 20192 that they could grow monkey embryos in a dish for up to 20 days after fertilization. In 2017, they reported a series of other hybrids: pig embryos grown with human cells, cow embryos grown with human cells, and rat embryos grown with mouse cells3.

But the latest work has divided developmental biologists. Some question the need for such experiments using closely related primates — these animals are not likely to be used as model animals in the way that mice and rodents are. Nonhuman primates are protected by stricter research ethics rules than are rodents, and they worry such work is likely to stoke public opposition.

“There are much more sensible experiments in this area of chimaeras as a source of organs and tissues,” says Alfonso Martinez Arias, a developmental biologist at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, Spain. Experiments with livestock animals, such as pigs and cows, are “more promising and do not risk challenging ethical boundaries”, he says. “There is a whole field of organoids, which can hopefully do away with animal research.”

Touchy subject

Izpisua Belmonte says that the team does not intend to implant any hybrid embryos into monkeys. Rather, the goal is to better understand how cells of different species communicate with each other in the embryo during its early growth phase.

Attempts at growing human–mouse hybrids are still preliminary and chimaeras need to be more effective and healthier before they can be useful. Scientists suspect that such hybrids might have trouble thriving because the two species are evolutionarily distant, so the cells communicate through different means. But observing cellular cross-talk in monkey–human embryo chimaeras — which involve two more closely related species — could suggest ways to improve the viability of future human–mouse models, Izpisua Belmonte says.

In the study, researchers fertilized eggs extracted from cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) and grew them in culture. Six days after fertilization, the team injected 132 embryos with human extended pluripotent stem cells, which can grow into a range of cell types inside and outside an embryo. The embryos each developed unique combinations of human and monkey cells and deteriorated at varying rates: 11 days after fertilization, 91 were alive; this dropped to 12 embryos at day 17 and 3 embryos at day 19.

“This paper is a dramatic demonstration of the ability of human pluripotent stem cells to be incorporated into the embryos of cynomolgus monkey when introduced into the monkey blastocysts,” says Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz, a developmental biologist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. She noted that this team, like others in the past, was not able to control which cells developed into which tissues — a key step to master before such models can be used.

Martinez Arias was not convinced by the results. “I expect better evidence,” especially of the later stages of development, he says. That embryo numbers rapidly plummeted as they approached day 15 of development suggests to him “that the things are very sick”.

Combining human cells with closely related primate embryos prompts questions about the status and identity of the resulting hybrids. “Some people may see that you’re creating morally ambiguous entities there,” says Insoo Hyun, a bioethicist at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. He says this team was thorough in following existing guidelines. “I think they did quite a bit of due care to be mindful of regulations and ethical issues.”

Research restrictions

Meanwhile, international guidelines are catching up to the field’s advances — next month, the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) is expected to publish revised guidelines for stem-cell research. These will address nonhuman-primate and human chimaeras, says Hyun, who is leading an ISSCR committee discussing chimaeras. That group’s guidelines currently prohibit researchers from letting human–animal chimaeras mate. Also, the group recommends additional oversight when human cells could integrate with an animal host’s developing central nervous system.

Many countries — including the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan — have at points limited research on chimaeras involving human cells. Japan lifted its ban on experiments with animal embryos containing human cells in 2019 and began funding such work that year.

In 2015, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced a moratorium on federal funding for studies in which human cells would be injected into animal embryos. In 2016, the funding agency proposed lifting the ban but restricting research to hybrids created after gastrulation, when the early nervous system begins to form. More than four years later, the funding ban is still in place. An NIH spokesperson says the agency is awaiting the May ISSCR update “to ensure our position reflects the input from the community”, but did not provide a timeline for release of the agency’s rules.",959,6095,8,62

REUTERS/Stringer

Opponents of Myanmar's junta announced a National Unity Government on Friday including ousted members of parliament and leaders of anti-coup protests and ethnic minorities, saying their aim was to end military rule and restore democracy.

Myanmar has been in turmoil since the Feb. 1 coup that ousted a civilian government led by democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi which had held power for five years and was starting its second term after a landslide election victory in November.

People have taken to the streets day after day to demand the restoration of democracy, defying crackdowns by the security forces in which more than 700 people have been killed, according to a monitoring group.

At the same time, political leaders, including ousted members of parliament from Suu Kyi's party, have been trying to organise to show the country and the outside world that they and not the generals are the legitimate political authority.

""Please welcome the people's government,"" veteran democracy activist Min Ko Naing said in a 10-minute video address announcing the formation of the National Unity Government (NUG).

While setting out few positions, Min Ko Naing said the will of the people was the unity government's priority, while acknowledging the scale of the task at hand.

""We're trying to get this out from the roots so we have to sacrifice a lot,"" he said, referring to the junta.

A spokesman for the junta could not be reached for comment.

The generals justified their takeover with accusations of fraud in the November election won by Suu Kyi's party, though the election commission dismissed the objections.

One of the unity government's primary objectives will be to win international support and recognition.

""We are the democratically elected leaders of Myanmar,"" said the unity government's minister of international cooperation, Dr Sasa, who goes by one name.

""So if the free and democratic world rejects us that means they reject democracy.""

International pressure has been building on the Myanmar military, particularly from Western governments that have imposed limited sanctions, though the generals have a long record of dismissing what they see as outside interference. read more

The unity government released a list of office holders including members of ethnic minorities and protest leaders, underlining the unity of purpose between the pro-democracy movement and autonomy-seeking minority communities, some of whom have battled the central government for decades.

CLAPPING IN THE DARK

Suu Kyi, who has been in detention since the coup, was listed as state counsellor, the post she held in government.

The only known communication she has had with the outside world since the coup has been monitored video calls with her lawyers.

A spokesman for the democratic politicians said while they could not inform her about their new government, he was sure she was aware of what was happening.

Sasa told Reuters the objective was to end violence, restore democracy and build a ""federal democratic union"". The military, while playing lip service to the idea of federalism, has long seen itself as the core power holding the country together.

Unity government leaders said they intended to form a federal army and were in talks with ethnic minority forces.

The Special Advisory Council for Myanmar, a group of international experts including former United Nations officials, hailed the creation of the NUG as historic and said it was the legitimate government.

After darkness fell over Myanmar's biggest city Yangon, people clapped at their windows and chanted ""our government"", video posted by activists on Twitter showed. Some community groups reported the sound of explosions and gunfire shortly afterwards.

While the politicians were announcing the unity government, other opponents of military rule observed a ""silent strike"" staying home to mourn those killed or wearing black in small marches in half a dozen cities and towns, media reported.

Yangon's streets were largely deserted, residents said.

There were no immediate reports of violence at Friday's rallies.

The military has also been rounding up critics and state media announced arrest warrants for 20 doctors on charges of encouraging dissent in the armed forces. The junta is seeking more than 200 people, including several internet celebrities, actors and singers, on the same change.

The turmoil has alarmed Myanmar's neighbours in Southeast Asia who have been trying to encourage talks between the rival sides.

Leaders of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which includes Myanmar, will meet in Indonesia on April 24 to discuss the situation, Thai and Indonesian media reported.

Junta leader Senior General Min Aung Hlaing was due to attend, a Thai broadcaster said, but the Jakarta Post said it had not been confirmed whether the summit would include representatives of the junta or the former government.

Sasa said ASEAN should not invite ""murderer-in-chief"" Min Aung Hlaing.

0,"Beijing warns US, Japan against collusion vs China",https://news.yahoo.com/beijing-warns-us-japan-against-092813433.html,"BEIJING (AP) — China said Friday it has expressed “serious concerns” to the United States and Japan over what it calls negative moves and collusion between the two countries against China.

The statement from Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian came just before President Joe Biden welcomes Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to the White House on Friday in his first face-to-face meeting with a foreign leader.

That meeting is seen as reflecting Biden’s emphasis on strengthening alliances to deal with a more assertive China and other global challenges.

Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing that Japan and the United States should “take China’s concerns and demands seriously, avoid words and actions that interfere in China’s internal affairs and harm China’s interests.”

“China has no objection to the development of normal bilateral relations between Japan and the United States, but such relations should help enhance mutual understanding and trust among regional countries and contribute to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, and should not target or harm the interests of third parties,"" Zhao said.

China would “make necessary responses as appropriate,"" he said.

Biden and Suga see their meeting as a chance to counter messaging from Chinese President Xi Jinping that America and democracies in general are on the decline, after the political turmoil and backing away from global leadership that marked Donald Trump’s presidency.

Japan remains China's traditional rival dating from Tokyo's brutal WWII occupation of much of the country. Relations between Washington and Beijing are tenser than ever over trade, technology, Hong Kong, Taiwan and human rights, particularly China's policies toward Turkic Muslims in the northwestern region of Xinjiang.

U.S. and Chinese naval movements in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea, which China claims virtually in its entirety, have added to tensions in recent days, following statements from U.S. officials that Beijing may be accelerating its schedule to annex Taiwan by force.

The Biden administration says the primary challenge for the United States lies in managing U.S. policies toward the Indo-Pacific, the main theater in which China is flexing its growing economic and military power. That helped guide Biden’s decision, announced this week, to pull U.S. troops out of Afghanistan and free the administration to focus more on East Asia.",374,2431,8,50

Myanmar’s junta on Saturday announced it pardoned and released more than 23,000 prisoners to mark the traditional Thingyan New Year holiday, but it wasn’t immediately clear if they included pro-democracy activists who were detained in the wake of the military’s seizure of power in February.

Advertising Read more

The releases were announced on state broadcaster MRTV, which said that junta chief Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing had pardoned 23,047 prisoners, including 137 foreigners who will be deported from Myanmar. He also reduced sentences for others.

The move comes as daily protests against the Feb. 1 ouster of the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi continue, as does the use of deadly force against them.

According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which monitors casualties and arrests, government forces have killed at least 728 protesters and bystanders since the takeover. The group says 3,141 people, including Suu Kyi, are in detention.

Unconfirmed but credible accounts with photos on social media claimed that three people were killed Saturday by security forces in a violent crackdown in the central city of Mogok, in Myanmar’s gem mining region.

Detainees released Saturday from Yangon’s Insein Prison included at least three political prisoners who were jailed in 2019, said witnesses and local press reports.

The three are members of the Peacock Generation performance troupe where were arrested during that year's New Year celebrations for skits that poked fun at military representatives in Parliament and military involvement in business.

Their traditional style of acting is called Thangyat, a mash-up of poetry, comedy and music with a sharp undertone of satire. Several members of the troupe were convicted under a law banning circulation of information that could endanger or demoralize members of the military. The actors may have drawn the special wrath of the military because they performed in army uniforms.

Several members were also found guilty of online defamation for livestreaming their performances. It could not be ascertained if all imprisoned members of the troupe were released.

Another freed prisoner was Ross Dunkley, an Australian newspaper entrepreneur sentenced in 2019 to 13 years in a Myanmar prison for drug possession. His release was confirmed by his ex-wife Cynda Johnston, reported The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper.

Dunkley co-founded the The Myanmar Times, an English-language daily, but was forced to give up his share in it. He became well-known for co-founding or acquiring English-language publications in formerly socialist states that were seeking foreign investment as they liberalized their economies, but was sometimes criticized for doing business with authoritarian regimes.

Early prisoner releases are customary during major holidays, and this is the second batch the ruling junta has announced since taking power.

Following the release of more than 23,000 convicts to mark Union Day on Feb. 12, there were reports on social media that some were recruited by the authorities to carry out violence at night in residential areas to spread panic, especially by setting fires. Some areas responded by setting up their own neighborhood watch groups.

In March, more than 600 people who were imprisoned for demonstrating against the February coup were released from Insein Prison, a rare conciliatory gesture by the military that appeared aimed at placating the protest movement.

Those freed were mostly young people caught in sweeps of street demonstrations, while those considered protest leaders were kept locked up.

Neither the military government nor those opposed to it show any signs of backing off from their struggle for power. Western nations have tried to pressure the military through diplomatic and economic sanctions with little evident effect.

Myanmar’s Southeast Asian neighbors, concerned about the prospects for regional instability, are also trying to get the junta to start back on the path to restoring democracy, or at least end its violent repression.

A spokesman for Thailand’s Foreign Ministry in Bangkok said Saturday that junta chief Min Aung Hlaing has confirmed he will attend a summit meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations — ASEAN — expected to be held on April 24.

Tanee Sangrat said in a text message to journalists that Brunei, the current chair of the 10-nation body, confirmed it had proposed the date for a meeting at the group’s secretariat in the Indonesian capital Jakarta. Indonesia has taken the lead in calling for the special meeting to discuss the crisis in Myanmar.

Ludovic Marin /Pool via REUTERS/File Photo

The United States has ordered its non-essential staff in Chad to leave the African country as rebel fighters approached the capital on Sunday after early election results showed President Idriss Deby on course to extend his three-decade rule.

Deby, who seized power in 1990 at the head of an armed rebellion, is a staunch ally of France and the United States in the fight against Islamist militants in the arid Sahel region.

""Due to their growing proximity to N'Djamena and the possibility for violence in the city, non-essential U.S. government employees have been ordered to leave Chad by commercial airline,"" the U.S. state department said in a statement.

The British government on Saturday urged its citizens to leave because, it said, two armed convoys from the rebel Front for Change and Concord in Chad (FACT) were advancing towards the capital.

One convoy was seen approaching the town of Mao, about 220 km (137 miles) to the north of N'Djamena, it said.

Large numbers of heavily armed Chad security forces were patrolling the streets of the capital on Sunday morning, a Reuters witness said.

Chad's army said it had destroyed a rebel convoy in the north of Kanem province on Saturday afternoon.

""The column was totally decimated,"" army spokesman Azim Bermandoa Agouna said in a statement late on Saturday.

Partial provisional results have given Deby a strong lead in the April 11 poll despite signs of growing discontent over his handling of the nation's oil wealth.

Deby, one of Africa's longest-serving leaders, has successfully put down a string of rebellions since taking power, sometimes with military assistance from France.

French air strikes helped the Chad army to repel a rebel incursion from Libya in February 2019.

FACT, which is based on Chad's northern frontier in Libya, attacked a Chadian border post on the evening of April 11, just as polling stations were closing.

On Friday FACT said it had seized a garrison of Gouri in the country's north.

""The enemy, despite the logistical support of the French Air Force, was totally routed,"" FACT spokesman Kingabe Ogouzeimi de Tapol said in a statement posted on Facebook.

France's defence ministry on Sunday declined to comment on whether it was involved.

PHILIPPE WOJAZER/Reuters

If one Tyrannosaurus rex - the school bus-sized meat-eating dinosaur that stalked the Cretaceous Period landscape - seems impressive, how about 2.5 billion of them?

Researchers on Thursday unveiled the first calculation of the total T. rex population during the estimated 2.4 million years that this fearsome species inhabited western North America during the twilight of the age of dinosaurs.

They considered factors including the size of its geographic range, its body mass, growth pattern, age at sexual maturity, life expectancy, duration of a single generation and the total time that T. rex existed before extinction 66 million years ago. They also heeded a doctrine called Damuth’s law linking population to body mass: the bigger the animal, the fewer the individuals.

Story continues below advertisement

Their analysis put the total number of T. rex individuals that ever existed at about 2.5 billion, including approximately 20,000 adults alive at any one time.

Fossils of more than 40 T. rex individuals have been found since it was first described in 1905, providing a wealth of information about a beast that thrives in the popular imagination.

“Why iconic?” asked paleontologist Charles Marshall, who led the study published in the journal Science.

“Heck, a hugely massive killer with super-huge teeth, one that you would never dream up on your own if we didn’t have the fossil record. So not only super-cool and beyond the imagination, but real. Like Godzilla, but actually real. And I think we like feeling small, and T. rex sure makes us feel small and vulnerable,” Prof. Marshall said.

Inside Victoria’s Dino Lab, where ancient bones await new homes

It was among the largest carnivorous dinosaurs, possessing a skull about five feet (1.5 metres) long, massive and muscular jaws with a bite force capable of crushing bone, a mouthful of banana-sized serrated teeth, a keen sense of smell, strong legs and puny arms with hands boasting just two fingers.

Perhaps the largest-known T. rex is a specimen named Sue at the Field Museum in Chicago, measuring 40-1/2-foot-long (12.3-metres), weighing an estimated nine tons and living about 33 years.

The new study put the weight of the average adult T. rex at 5.2 tons, average lifespan at 28 years, generation time at 19 years, total number of generations of the species at about 125,000, and its geographic range at roughly 890,000 square miles (2.3 million square kilometers).

Story continues below advertisement

They calculated an average population density of about one T. rex for every roughly 40 square miles (100 square kilometres).

T. rex fossils have been found in Alberta and Saskatchewan and the U.S. states of Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. T. rex apparently met a fiery end when an asteroid slammed into Mexico, exterminating three quarters of Earth’s species.

While the uncertainties in the estimates were large and some of the assumptions may be challenged by other paleontologists, the study was a worthwhile effort to expand the understanding of this famous dinosaur, said Prof. Marshall, director of the University of California Museum of Paleontology and a University of California, Berkeley professor of integrative biology.

The formula could be applied to other extinct animals, Prof. Marshall added.

Paleontologist and study co-author Ashley Poust of the San Diego Natural History Museum said while 2.5 billion is a lot, it represents only about a third of Earth’s current human population - and 20,000 is merely the size of a small town.

“They’d have to meet up over possibly long distances to mate, or maybe even care for their young,” Prof. Poust said of Tyrannosaurus. “The numbers can seem big and cold, but I guess I see them as a pretty intimate window into their lives.”

India’s capital New Delhi recorded 25,500 coronavirus cases in a 24-hour period, with about one in three people tested returning a positive result, its chief minister said, urging the federal government to provide more hospital beds to tackle the crisis.

Less than 100 critical care beds were available in the city of more than 20 million people, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Sunday, as social media was flooded with people complaining about lack of beds, oxygen cylinders and drugs.

""The bigger worry is that in last 24 hours positivity rate has increased to around 30% from 24% ... The cases are rising very rapidly. The beds are filling fast,"" Kejriwal told a news briefing.

In a separate statement, the city government said it had informed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's federal administration about ""the dire need of beds and oxygen"" and beds were now being set up in schools.

New Delhi, which has imposed a weekend curfew, is among the worst hit cities in India, where a second major wave of coronavirus infections is straining health infrastructure.

Nationwide, India reported 261,500 new cases on Sunday, taking the total number of cases to nearly 14.8 million, second only to the United States, which has reported more than 31 million infections. The country's deaths from COVID-19 rose by a record 1,501 to reach a total of 177,150.

As cases rise across India, criticism is mounting over how Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration has handled the health crisis, as religious festivals and election rallies attended by thousands continue.

India’s government relaxed almost all lockdown curbs of last year by the beginning of 2021, although some regions including New Delhi and the state of Maharashtra, home to financial hub Mumbai, have introduced localised restrictions.

While Mumbai remains under curfew on all days as per state guidelines, New Delhi has allowed cinema halls to operate at 30% capacity and people to move freely during weekdays.

""There is no option but to lockdown Delhi for 1-2 weeks,"" said Dr. Ambrish Mithal, a top doctor of endocrinology and diabetes at hospital operator Max Healthcare, adding that weekend curfews ""won't do"".

""(The) situation is unmanageable at present,"" he said on Twitter.

ELECTION RALLIES

Amid reports of severe shortage of oxygen supplies and critical medicines such as the anti-viral drug Remdesivir, Modi on Saturday asked authorities to pull out all the stops to ramp up production of COVID-19 vaccines and asked his teams to work closely with local governments.

But opposition parties, including the Congress party, criticised Modi for addressing large election rallies to help his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) win the state assembly election in the eastern state of West Bengal.

Addressing a large gathering of his supporters in West Bengal on Saturday, Modi said: ""I can see a sea of masses. I haven't seen a rally like this.""

The Aam Aadmi (Common Man) Party, which is in power in the capital, New Delhi, mocked Modi's political rallies by posting pictures on social media of funeral pyres at overburdened crematoriums of the city.

""I deplore his (Modi's) remarks,"" Yashwant Sinha, a former cabinet minister who broke away from the BJP, said on Twitter, adding that they were insensitive.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi - who has also addressed election rallies in recent weeks - said on Sunday he was suspending all his public rallies in West Bengal.

Amit Shah, the government's interior minister and Modi's close aide, addressed an election rally in the state on Sunday which was attended by thousands of people, few of whom followed social distancing norms, according to a video on his Twitter account.

Adding to the crisis, at least five coronavirus patients died in a hospital fire late on Saturday in Raipur, the capital of the central state of Chhattisgarh.

“We know there’s been speculation about the origin of the demonic forces in Doom, so we’re excited to officially confirm fan theories that the game’s antagonists were given their ghastly forms as punishment for getting sexually aroused by a Victoria’s Secret advertisement while they were home sick from school,” series director Hugo Martin told OGN, noting that antagonists such as the Arachnotron had been imbued with a hideous spider-like form for staying up late in eighth grade to watch the scrambled Spice channel in his bedroom.

Martin went on to note that—while not in any way referenced in-game—the studio designed elaborate onanism-based backstories for every single demonic foe that you kill, stressing that the stronger the demon, the more they sinned against God by committing the sin of self-pleasure. For example, he indicated that the three Hell Priests each separately torrented Hustler videos on the family’s shared computer as 13-year-olds, before giving up and masturbating into a tube sock.

“One of the enemies we’re most proud of is the leader of the Maykrs, Khan Maykr, who achieved her rank in hell for committing the ultimate sin of using a vibrator while fantasizing about a crush from geometry class,” he continued. “In fact, the primary motivation for these characters invading Earth is an attempt to slake their depraved lust for self-abuse and sexually-suggestive photographs.”

So, there you have it, gamers! Thanks to the master storytellers at Bethesda, there’s even more depth to explore in one of the greatest video game franchises of all time. Happy slaying!",377,2348,20,122

And I let them know, even if things do get serious, the most they’d ever have to deal with is an occasional visit to lay flowers at her graveside.” Dugas added that even if she found the right man, she had no plans to have any living children of her own since she knew she’d be a pretty terrible mother.

REUTERS/Stringer

Opponents of military rule in Myanmar observed a “silent strike” on Friday, with many people staying home to mourn the more than 700 people killed in protests against a Feb. 1 coup and others wearing black held small marches in several cities and towns.

Many Myanmar citizens, infuriated by the return of military rule after five years of civilian government led by democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi, have been taking to the streets day after day with activists thinking up new ways to show opposition as the security forces step up their suppression.

""Let's make the roads silent,"" protest leader Ei Thinzar Maung posted on her Facebook page.

""We have to stage a Silent Strike to show our sorrow for the martyrs who have scarified their lives. The most silent voice is the loudest.""

Friday is the fourth day of the five-day traditional Buddhist New Year holiday, known as Thingyan. Most people this year are shunning the usual festivities to focus on their campaign against the generals who overthrew Suu Kyi's government and locked up her and many others.

Streets in the main city of Yangon were largely deserted, residents said, while black-clad protesters held small rallies in half a dozen cities and towns, media reported.

There were no immediate reports of violence but overnight, two people were shot and killed in the central town of Myingyan, Radio Free Asia reported.

A spokesman for the junta could not be reached for comment.

The military has also been rounding up its critics and has published the names of more than 200 people wanted under a law that makes it illegal to encourage mutiny or dereliction of duty in the armed forces.

Two prominent protest organisers were arrested on Thursday along with an actor and singer, both known for speaking out against the coup.

Late on Thursday, soldiers raided a famous Buddhist monastery in the second city of Mandalay and arrested two people, the Myanmar Now media group reported.

SOUTH KOREANS END VENTURE

Opponents have been organising both at home and abroad with the aim of stepping up their campaign.

A previously unknown group called the Ayeyarwaddy Federal Army said on Facebook it aimed to fight the military to restore an elected government and protect the people and it called for volunteers.

It gave no details about how it aimed to take on the well-equipped and seasoned army, which has been battling ethnic minority insurgents for decades.

International pressure has also been slowly building on the military, particularly from Western governments, though the military has a long record of brushing off outside pressure.

The European Union has agreed to impose sanctions on another 10 individuals linked to the coup and to target two businesses run by the armed forces for the first time in protest at the military takeover, two diplomats said.

While the EU has an arms embargo on Myanmar and targeted 11 senior military officials last month, the decision to target the two companies is the most significant response for the bloc since the coup.

EU diplomats told Reuters in March that parts of the military's conglomerates, Myanma Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC), would be targeted, barring EU investors and banks from doing business with them.

Human rights groups have also called for them to be sanctioned.

The EU declined to comment and no one at Myanmar's mission to the EU in Brussels could be reached for reaction.

In rare action by an Asian company, South Korea’s POSCO Coated & Color Steel Co Ltd (POSCO C&C) (058430.KS) said on Friday it would end its joint venture with MEHL.

The firm did not give details of how it would end the venture but a spokesman told Reuters while it was ending the venture relationship, it was not pulling out of Myanmar.

Leaders of Southeast Asian neighbours, which have been trying to encourage talks between the rival Myanmar sides, will meet in Indonesia on April 24 to discuss the situation, Thai and Indonesian media reported.

Junta leader Senior General Min Aung Hlaing was due to attend, a Thai broadcaster said, but the Jakarta Post said it had not been confirmed whether the summit would include representatives of the junta or the former government.

CHUGUR, Peru (AP) — As schools across Peru closed due to the coronavirus pandemic, Pedro Castillo tried to find a way to keep classes going for his 20 fifth- and sixth-grade students. But in his impoverished rural community deep in the Andes, his efforts were futile.

Seventeen of the students didn’t even have access to a cellphone. Tablets promised by the government never arrived.

“I called my students who have a basic cellphone, and the father answers you from the farm. You cannot connect with the child,” he said. “You call again in the afternoon or evening. The children don’t answer because they are exhausted in bed.”

ADVERTISEMENT

“Where is the state?” Castillo, 51, told The Associated Press after a day of planting sweet potatoes on his own land.

It was the last straw for Castillo, who over 25 years had seen his students struggle in crumbling schools where teachers also cook, sweep floors and file paperwork. He’d already dabbled in activism with the local teachers’ union and helped lead a national strike in 2017. But now he went further, tossing his name into a crowd of 18 candidates in Peru’s presidential election.

Defying the polls, the elementary school teacher came first in the April 11 voting , albeit with less than 20% of the overall vote. The stunning result gave him a place in June’s presidential runoff against Keiko Fujimori, one of Peru’s most established political figures and the daughter of former president Alberto Fujimori. It is her third attempt to become president.

Castillo’s unlikely campaign comes at a turbulent time for the South American nation that has suffered like few others from the COVID-19 pandemic. It recently ran through three presidents in a week after one was removed by congress over corruption allegations. Every president of the past 36 years has been ensnared in corruption allegations, some imprisoned. One died by suicide before police could arrest him.

Fujimori herself has been imprisoned as part of a graft investigation though she was later released. And her father Alberto, who governed between 1990 and 2000, is serving a 25-year sentence for corruption and the killings of 25 people. She has promised to free him should she win.

The two candidates have had dramatically different lives.

While Fujimori’s father himself was a political outsider when he won office, his daughter grew up in the halls of power. She attended Boston University and got a master’s from Columbia University in the United States. She later served as first lady during her father’s last six years in office.

Castillo is the son of illiterate peasants, the third of nine children. While he went on to complete a degree in educational psychology at Peru’s César Vallejo University, he still lives in the country’s third poorest district, his home surrounded by cypress trees, cornfields, pigs and cows.

He wears ponchos, straw hats and sandals made from leftover tires. When he walks through rural areas, people run to shake his hand.

“He is my neighbor, he is good people, he talks to us wherever he is,” said Emelina Medina, 70, who was shucking corn at her home a few blocks from Castillo’s house.

He also made a favorable impression on 31-year-old Elizabeth Altamirano, though she said she doesn’t know him personally.

“He is in favor of the countryside. We have not finished primary school, we have not had the ability to eat good food,” she said. “He is a peasant, a teacher. Politicians have only come to the (presidential) palace to profit, while we live in misery.”

Castillo’s politics mingle a nationalist, agrarian leftism with socially conservative impulses. He is Catholic and his wife, Lilia Paredes, a rural teacher like him, and his two children are evangelical. He has expressed opposition to same-sex marriage and has said that for him abortion and LGBT issues “are not a priority.”

He has proposed nationalizing mining, oil and energy sectors as well as deporting all immigrants living in the country illegally who commit crimes, a move aimed largely at the wave of Venezuelans who have sought refuge from their country’s crisis.

His chances of enacting his policies are uncertain. He would face a deeply divided unicameral congress that was newly elected on April 11. At the moment, his party has 37 of the 130 seats though the electoral counting to determine how many seats each party gets has not yet concluded.

It is also very much up in the air his chance of winning the June runoff against Fujimori. He received roughly 19% support in the first round of voting and she about 13%, leaving a vast sector of the electorate that supported neither.

His proposals to nationalize broad sectors of the economy have alarmed many in Peru, including business interests.

Peruvian Nobel Prize laureate for literature Mario Vargas Llosa, a longtime critic of Keiko Fujimori and her father, in a column published Saturday in the newspaper El País, warned that if Castillo wins in June, Peru will become like crisis-wracked Venezuela.

“It is an unprecedented danger, the daughter of pure ignorance,” wrote Vargas Llosa, who lost Peru’s 1990 presidential election to Alberto Fujimori. He urged people to support Keiko Fujimori as “the lesser evil.”

Whoever wins the runoff will have to cope with the economic hammer-blow of the pandemic, which prompted a lockdown of more than 100 days that left about 7 million people unemployed.

The country has recorded more than 1.6 million confirmed cases and over 56,400 deaths from COVID, and rising death counts recently forced the return of lockdowns.

According to data collected by Johns Hopkins University, only 1.48% of the population has been fully vaccinated, undermining hopes for a quick recovery from the pandemic.

Unlike former Bolivian President Evo Morales - an Indigenous former coca growers’ union leader to whom he has been compared - Castillo has held no public office before this run for the presidency. Morales held a seat in Bolivia’s Chamber of Deputies before becoming president.

Castillo’s lone “political post” was leading the 55-day teachers’ strike for better pay. He was an active rural teacher until 2020. Even with the campaign entering a critical phase, Castillo has continued to work on his farm in Chugur, hundreds of miles north of Lima, the capital.

“When you go out to ask for rights, they say that you are a terrorist,” said Castillo, apparently referring to unsupported allegations by some Peruvian media outlets that has ties to the country’s Maoist Shining Path rebel group.

“I know the country and they will not be able to shut me up,” he said. “The terrorists are hunger and misery, abandonment, inequality, injustice.”

Joe Manchin (D-WV) claimed Wednesday that West Virginians were too deficient in character and grit to deserve a $15 minimum wage. “Frankly, Mountain Staters have never shown the work ethic or drive necessary to merit $15 an hour, so what makes them think they have any right to that kind of money?” said Manchin, who added that he hadn’t gone to Washington to bring home benefits to constituents who lacked the moral fiber, backbone, and talent required to provide for themselves. “If the people of West Virginia want to earn a living wage, they need to pound the pavement until they get a job that pays one. Look at me: I went out there, found work in the U.S. Senate, and became a multimillionaire. So don’t tell me a person can’t work his way up.” Manchin went on to observe that the least West Virginians could do is take enough personal responsibility to vote out the legislators in Charleston who set the state minimum wage at a measly $8.75 per hour.

1,"I'm Like a Chocoholic, But for Booze","http://www.theonion.com/articles/im-like-a-chocoholic-but-for-booze,10739/","Ralph Chadwick



Did you ever know a ""chocoholic""? One of those folks who just can't get enough chocolate? I bet there's at least one in your home or workplace. At my house, it's my wife Emily. She's got to have her little bowl of Hershey's Kisses in the living room. She can't go shopping without bringing home some chocolate ice cream or a chocolate-cake mix. She's even got a funny little sweatshirt that says, ""My Name Is Emily, And I'm A Chocoholic.""

Advertisement

To be honest, I'm a bit of a chocoholic myself. Except for one small detail. You see, instead of being addicted to chocolate, I'm addicted to booze. Yep, from dawn to dusk, there's one thing on my mind: booze! Beer, liquor, wine, all that stuff!

When my wife gets one of her cravings, she reaches for a Baby Ruth or Mars bar. With me, it's Icehouse beer. My refrigerator is always stocked with plenty of it. I also have a little flask of whiskey in my desk drawer at work. In fact, if you can keep a secret, I even keep some booze in my car in case of traffic jams. I just can't stand to be without booze for too long!

I'm a lot like that Cookie Monster on Sesame Street. Only it's more like the Booze Monster. When I walk into a party and see that they have booze of any kind, it's like, ""Whoa-hoa! All bets are off! Lemme at that booze!""

I remember this one time, there was no chocolate in the house. Emily was going out of her mind, trying to scrape up some sort of chocolate fix. In the end, she resorted to drinking a cup of hot cocoa. It was so cute! Sort of like the time I drank all her hairspray because there was no booze in the house. Or that other time with the rubbing alcohol. Or the Nyquil. Or the Aqua-Velva.

Another time, I was completely out of booze, and all the stores and bars were closed, so I drove 45 minutes to find a place that would sell me some beer or something. I was kind of embarrassed, because here it was late Monday night, and I had to work the next day, and I'm driving around looking for booze. But, hey, that's just how things are when you're a ""booze-oholic"" like me! I finally found a huge all-night liquor store. You should have seen how I loaded up! Cases of this, fifths of that. It was 5 a.m. when I finally got home, so I just said, ""To heck with work!"" and had my own little improvised holiday. I called it Booze Day! I'd been working hard, getting to work on time almost every day for two weeks, so I figured I'd earned what wound up being the rest of the week off.

Sometimes Emily and I think we should cut down a little–you know, health concerns and all. But there's always some special occasion that gives us an excuse to go off our ""diets."" Halloween was Emily's last big bender. We only got three trick-or-treaters the entire night, so the whole big bowl of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups went straight to her. (Or straight to her thighs, as she said!)

Advertisement

My most recent bender was today. There was a good movie on TV, and I figured, hey, I'll need steady hands to change the volume. Of course, it all went straight to my liver, but what are you gonna do?

For my birthday, Emily gave me the funniest coffee mug, perfect for Irish coffee. It has a little teddy bear on it with a ""don't mess with me"" look on his face, and it says, ""Hand Over The Booze And Nobody Gets Hurt."" I laughed so hard! That bear was just like me when I robbed the party store earlier this year! Also, the mug is really big, so it can hold a lot of booze… another plus!

Yes, those chocoholics are a funny sort. But they won't hurt you–as long as they have their chocolate, that is. Or, in my case, booze!",691,3633,7,36

Overall, these are very low numbers for America at this stage in the republic.

The country's health ministry said the crash happened about 40 kilometres (25 miles) outside the capital.

Over 55 ambulances were dispatched to treat the injured, the ministry said, and investigators have been sent to assess the accident's cause.

The train was set to travel to the northeast city of Mansoura.

Reuters news agency said eight carriages had overturned, citing a post on the province's verified Facebook page.

The state-run Ahram daily reported that authorities have detained at least 10 railway officials, including the train driver and his assistant.

A video on social media purported to show the train lying on its side and widespread debris. This footage has not been independently verified by DW.

In March, two trains collided in the Sohag Governorate in Egypt, killing 18 people and injuring at least 200 others.

Egypt sees frequent crashes on its railway system due in part to poor maintenance and lack of investment.

0,Why is this not making more headlines?,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-united-states-standoff-fears/,"Moscow — Russia warned the United States on Tuesday against sending warships to the Black Sea, urging American forces to stay away from the annexed Crimean peninsula ""for their own good"" as the situation along Ukraine's border caused increasing concern in the West. The U.S. Secretary of State, meeting with Ukrainian and NATO officials in Brussels, made it clear that the Biden administration, along with its allies in Europe, has Ukraine's back and considers Russia's ongoing military buildup in the region ""very provocative.""

The Turkish Foreign Ministry said on Friday that Washington had informed Ankara that two U.S. warships would pass through Turkish waters this week to be deployed in the Black Sea. The deployment would come amid a significant escalation of the conflict in eastern Ukraine between Russian-backed separatists and Ukraine's forces, which have U.S. and European support.

Hostilities first flared in 2014 when Russia unilaterally annexed Crimea — a peninsula that sticks out into the Black Sea and is home to a Russian navy base — away from Ukraine, drawing condemnation from the Western world and a series of sanctions.

Russian Deputy Foreign Ministry Sergei Ryabkov was cited by Russian news agencies on Tuesday as calling the deployment of U.S. warships in the Black Sea a provocation designed to test Russia's nerves.

""There is absolutely nothing for American ships to be doing near our shores,"" Ryabkov said, warning there was a very high risk of unspecified incidents if U.S. military hardware were to be positioned in the Black Sea.

""We warn the United States that it will be better for them to stay far away from Crimea and our Black Sea coast,"" Ryabkov was quoted as saying. ""It will be for their own good.""

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby declined during a regular press briefing on Friday to confirm the Turkish government's statement that U.S. warships were being sent to the Black Sea. He noted that the U.S. ""routinely"" operates in the Black Sea, but said he wouldn't ""speak to operations.""

The current escalation has added strain to already tense U.S.-Russian relations. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Russia against aggressive actions in an interview aired over the weekend, saying any aggression in Ukraine would have consequences.

Ryabkov responded on Tuesday, accusing the Russian ""adversary"" of trying to undermine Russia's position on the international stage. He reiterated Russia's readiness to defend the interests of its citizens, and ethnic Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was preparing itself in the event any new sanctions should be imposed on Moscow by the U.S. or its global partners.

Meanwhile, Russia has continued to move forces into both Crimea and the region along its border with Ukraine. The Defense Ministry reported on Tuesday that 15 warships and vessels of the Caspian Flotilla had been sent to the Black Sea as part of previously announced military exercises.

Ukraine said earlier this week that Russia had already massed more than 40,000 troops along its border, and at least 40,000 more in Crimea. Russia says the troop buildup is part of exercises, and has stressed that its forces will go where they want, when they want on Russian territory.

""Very provocative action""

Top U.S. officials are in Europe this week, including Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Blinken. Austin announced during a stop in Germany on Tuesday that the U.S. was going to deploy an additional 500 troops to that country.

When asked if the move was meant as a message to Russia, he said it was ""a sign to NATO"" of the U.S. commitment to the transatlantic alliance, and of the firm commitment to Germany. Under President Donald Trump, Washington said it would withdraw thousands of the American forces who've been stationed in Germany for decades. That decision was suspended by the Biden administration, and now the force is set to grow.

Blinken, meanwhile, was in Brussels, meeting NATO partners, and he met separately with his Ukrainian counterpart to discuss the standoff with Russia.

""The United States stands firmly behind the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and I'm her to reaffirm that with the foreign minister today,"" Blinken said. ""That's particularly important in a time when we're seeing, unfortunately, Russia take very provocative action when it comes to Ukraine. We're now seeing the largest concentration of Russian forces on Ukraine's border since 2014. That is a big concern not only to Ukraine, but to the United States and indeed to many of our allies and partners.""

For thousands of kilometers to the north and to the east of our border with Russia, there is no democracy. So, this is the struggle that is taking place between democracies and authoritarianism, and in this struggle the support of the United States is absolutely crucial, and deeply appreciated.""

Kuleba thanked NATO, also, and said that warnings already conveyed to Moscow through diplomatic channels, ""will be supported by actions that make it very clear for Russia that the price of further aggression against Ukraine will be too heavy for it to bear.""

He said the Ukrainian and U.S. delegations in Brussels, and more broadly the NATO allies at large, would continue discussing ways to ensure stability along his country's tense border with Russia.

While no NATO deployments have been confirmed, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed the alliance was planning to position 40,000 more troops and 15,000 pieces of military equipment close to Russian territory. He didn't elaborate, but said that ""in response to the military activity of the alliance that threatens Russia, we have taken appropriate measures.""

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said earlier on Tuesday that he was ""seriously concerned"" by Russia's deployment of additional forces to the Ukrainian border.

""Russia is now trying to reestablish some kind of sphere of influence where they try to decide what neighbors can do,"" Stoltenberg said.

A future where buses, trains, trucks, cars, home heating and farm machinery run on zero emission hydrogen fuel – that’s all part of the new hydrogen hub vision unveiled on Wednesday (14th April) for Edmonton, Canada.

Thought to be Canada’s first hydrogen hub, the vision for Edmonton has been backed by $1.2m in funding from Western Economic Diversification Canada (WD), $600,000 from Alberta’s Industrial Heartland Association and $450,000 from the Province of Alberta.

Such funds will help kickstart Edmonton Region’s low-carbon hydrogen economy, ushering in a wave of clean energy jobs and ensuring a strong economic future as the world shifts towards a greener future.

The hub represents an early hydrogen deployment hub as outlined in the Canadian Hydrogen Strategy and will serve as a blueprint of how to accelerate a strong regional hydrogen economy that can be replicated in other regions across the country with low-cost, low-carbon hydrogen.

With support from the Transition Accelerator, planning for the hub is underway for over 25 potential projects related to the supply, delivery and use of low-carbon hydrogen. Potential projects include the use of hydrogen for municipal and commercial vehicle fleets and home and industrial heat and power.

Welcoming the plans, the Honourable Jim Carr, Special Representative for the Prairies, said, “This investment to launch the Edmonton Region Hydrogen hub to accelerate the production and distribution of hydrogen fuel is part of our government’s Hydrogen Strategy and will help us achieve our goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.”

“Today’s announcement demonstrates how our government is committed to investing in the economy, creating jobs and supporting our energy workers.”

A final report released by Alberta’s Industrial Heartland Hydrogen Task Force outlined that Canadian hydrogen has a wholesale market potential of up to $100bn a year and identified the Edmonton Region as the best launch point for a pan-Canadian hydrogen economy[1].

Read more: Alberta’s Industrial Heartland Hydrogen Task Force details steps to a hydrogen-fuelled future

According to the report, the region is well-positioned for success because it has one of the lowest hydrogen production costs in the world, existing experience in hydrogen production, a vast network of pipeline infrastructure, and suitable and existing sites for carbon capture, utilisation and storage which are necessary to upgrade natural gas into hydrogen for use as a low-carbon fuel.

The report also found that the best way to quickly achieve sufficient scale for a strong Canada-wide hydrogen economy is through the creation and deliberate connection of regional hydrogen hubs across the country.

“Hydrogen has the potential to be not just a key part of the world’s cleaner energy future, but the future of Alberta’s dynamic energy industry. The launch of the Edmonton Region Hydrogen HUB is a critical step towards building that future by establishing the local connections which will pave the way for provincial, national, and international networks in the years to come,” said Dale Nally, Associate Minister of Natural Gas and Electricity, Government of Alberta.

“The Government of Alberta is proud to be a partner in the development of this first Canadian hub and we look forward to continuing our partnership with The Transition Accelerator, other levels of government, and industry as the hydrogen economy continues to gather momentum.”

“Achieving the low-carbon economy required of us will be a challenge; the hydrogen HUB checks all the boxes representing solutions to this challenge including: practical use of our current energy sector infrastructure and resources, the opportunity to be a global leader in an emerging industry, and the local unprecedented collaboration needed to achieve our ambitions,” added William Morin, Vice-Chair, Edmonton Region Hydrogen hub and Chief, Enoch Cree Nation.

Following the launch of Canada’s Hydrogen Strategy late last year, H2 View sat down with Sabina Russell, Zen Clean Energy Solutions’ Principal and co-author of the strategy. Speaking to Russell in exclusively, H2 View discussed why Canada’s time for hydrogen has come, what plans have been unveiled under the strategy and the country’s hopes for the future.

0,43 people sent by AKP municipality to Germany for workshop never returned to Turkey,https://www.duvarenglish.com/43-people-sent-by-akp-municipality-to-germany-for-workshop-have-not-returned-to-turkey-news-57112,"Duvar English

Some 43 out of 45 people from Turkey who attended a workshop in Germany have never returned back to the country.

The organization was part of an initiative launched by the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) municipality in the eastern Malatya province's Yeşilyurt district.

The workshop named “Project to Raise Environmentally Conscientious People” was held by Mega Kilit GMBH in the German city of Hannover.

The incident became public when Yeşilyurt councilors from the main opposition Republican Peoples' Party (CHP) have submitted a motion to Mayor Mehmet Çınar, demanding answers from him.

Online media outlet Artı Gerçek contacted two of the workshop attendees who never came back to Turkey.

The two people on April 15 said that Turkish authorities had provided them with service (gray) passports for their September 2020 trip to Germany.

“We came last year, but visits are still continuing. Two weeks ago, two buses [from Turkey] came to Hamburg,” they said, adding that they now hold temporary residence permits in Germany.

As Turkish authorities have launched an investigation into the incident, reports suggested that the case was not limited to the Yeşilyurt municipality.

Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) Muazzez Orhan filed a parliamentary question inquiring about rumors that a similar incident happened at an initiative launched by the trustee municipality of Van's Tuşba district.

Orhan said that the Tuşba municipality had similarly on Jan. 7 taken a decision to send 55 people to Germany “in a nonprocedural way.” He said that this decision was adopted at the city council despite the objections of HDP councilors.

The HDP lawmaker asked Vice President Fuat Oktay if the Tuşba municipality had sent personnel or councilors to Germany for the purposes of raising “environmentally conscientious people.”

“If they have been sent, have all of them returned back to the country? If not, who are the 'runaways'?” he asked.",309,1966,14,83

0,Democrats call on Biden to stop Saudi Arabia’s Yemen blockade,https://www.vox.com/2021/4/9/22375381/saudi-arabia-yemen-blockade-biden-letter,"Saudi Arabia is continuing its six-year air and sea blockade of Yemen, starving millions of Yemenis and deepening the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.

Anger from Democrats and progressives in the US isn’t just directed at Riyadh, though. It’s also aimed at the Biden administration for failing to fully pressure Saudi Arabia to lift the restrictions.

When Saudi Arabia and its allies launched a war against the Houthis in 2015 — with US support — Saudi used its military to block planes from landing and ships from docking in Yemen, saying such measures were necessary to stop the Houthis from smuggling in weapons, including from Iran.

The Saudi coalition is fighting to oust the Houthi rebels, who overthrew the internationally recognized government of President Abdrabbuh Mansur al-Hadi in 2015, and return al-Hadi, who currently lives in exile in Saudi Arabia, to power.

But critics warned the blockade would keep much-needed food, fuel, medicine, and humanitarian aid from reaching desperate Yemenis, including millions of children, who are caught in the middle of the fighting.

That concern proved devastatingly prophetic.

The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, the world’s top authority on food security, said last year that 47,000 Yemenis were suffering from famine-like conditions and that more than 16 million — over half of Yemen’s population — couldn’t reliably and adequately feed themselves. Multiple United Nations agencies have said that at least 400,000 Yemeni children could die this year alone if conditions don’t improve.

In early February, President Joe Biden promised the US would stop supporting the Saudi-led coalition’s offensive operations in the war. But, he added, “We’re going to continue to support and help Saudi Arabia defend its sovereignty and its territorial integrity and its people.”

Some analysts believe Riyadh took that as implicit support for the blockade, even as the Biden administration has consistently expressed the free flow of fuel and goods into Yemen is “critical.”

That may partly explain why Saudi Arabia has kept the restrictions in place. In March, for instance, CNN found that Saudi warships had kept all oil tankers from docking in the Houthi-controlled port of Hodeidah since the start of the year.

“The Saudi vessels that patrol the waters of Hodeidah have control over which commercial ships can dock and unload their cargo,” CNN reported. “Some goods are getting through — CNN witnessed aid being loaded on to trucks at the port after being delivered by ship — but not any fuel to deliver them.”

Now, Democrats want Biden to push Riyadh to end the blockade once and for all. Nearly 80 Democrats made that clear in a Tuesday letter to the president.

“We ask you to take additional steps to publicly pressure Saudi Arabia to lift this blockade immediately, unilaterally, and comprehensively,” wrote the lawmakers, including Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the House Intelligence Committee chair. Among other things, they want the Saudis to “[guarantee] that humanitarian and commercial imports can freely enter Yemen” and “[ensure] that and crossings for commercial and civilian traffic are permanently opened.”

“Every day that we wait for these issues to be resolved in negotiations is another day that pushes more children to the brink of death,” the letter added.

It’s unclear if the White House will listen to their plea. The Biden administration’s current approach toward the conflict is to try to broker a peace deal between the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis. Some progressive activists accuse the president and his team of wanting to keep the blockade in place to serve as a bargaining chip in negotiations.

“They support the blockade currently,” said Erik Sperling, executive director of Just Foreign Policy, a progressive foreign policy group. “The administration would only want it lifted as part of a comprehensive agreement.”

Other analysts disagree. “That’s hyperbolic,” said Seth Binder, an advocacy officer at the Project on Middle East Democracy (POMED) in Washington, DC, noting that Biden’s team restarted humanitarian funding for northern Yemen cut by the Trump administration and repeated calls for open trade.

Still, Binder said the president and his aides “could and should be sharpening their rhetoric” toward Saudi Arabia about ending the blockade.

Biden will continue to face pressure over the Saudi blockade

Days after CNN’s March report exposing the disastrous effects of the blockade, Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud proposed to reopen the airport in the Yemeni capital of Sana’a and allow food and fuel imports at Hodeidah.

“The initiative will take effect as soon as the Houthis agree to it,” the minister said. It was the first time Riyadh openly acknowledged carrying out a deliberate blockade in Yemen.

Hodeidah is vitally important to Yemen’s economy. It’s the country’s largest and most important port, and it’s crucial to the nation’s trade and taxation efforts, said Shamiran Mako, an assistant professor at Boston University.

But the Houthis almost immediately rejected the Saudi plan, saying it didn’t fully lift the long-imposed restrictions. “Opening the airports and seaports is a humanitarian right and should not be used as a pressure tool,” said Mohammed Abdulsalam, the Houthis’ chief negotiator. The Houthis, however, are also known to divert aid away from the population and to their own officials, supporters, and fighters.

Since then, the Saudi-led coalition has allowed at least four fuel ships in Hodeidah’s port, even as Riyadh has gone back to denying restrictions exist.

“There is no blockade,” the Saudi foreign minister told CNN in an interview this week, saying that 67 ships had docked in Hodeidah over the last three months and that the flow of goods continues at other crossings.

But experts say that’s still not enough to ease the humanitarian crisis. And they say Saudi Arabia won’t change its tune unless the Biden administration exerts significant pressure.

One way it could do that, POMED’s Binder said, is to threaten to further downgrade the US-Saudi relationship if such restrictions persist. “That gives the administration the most leverage” throughout the diplomatic process. For example, the US could further restrict arms sales to the kingdom or curtail economic ties.

Meanwhile, pressure from Democrats and activists has become more visible. Activists from Detroit and Dearborn, Michigan, have been on a hunger strike for more than 10 days, calling for an end to the blockade. Their effort has the support of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), who joined one of the striking activists, 26-year-old Iman Saleh, outside the White House for a press conference on Friday. It was Saleh’s 12th day without food.

Between the letter from lawmakers and increased activity from anti-blockade activists, it looks like Biden will continue to face criticism on the issue.

“Democrats are starting to get concerned and wanting to push the administration more,” Binder told me. “The honeymoon phase is coming to an end.”",1122,7100,10,61
0,American export controls threaten to hinder global vaccine production,https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2021/04/17/american-export-controls-threaten-to-hinder-global-vaccine-production,"LAST WEEK the billionth dose of covid-19 vaccine was produced. It is a sign of how greatly manufacturing capacity has expanded over the past six months that the next billion doses could be produced by May 27th, according to Airfinity, an analytics firm (see chart). Yet this ambition is at risk from American export controls on raw materials and equipment. Production lines in India, making at least 160m doses of covid vaccine a month, will come to a halt in the coming weeks unless America supplies 37 critical items.

On April 16th, Adar Poonawalla, the chief executive of the Serum Institute of India (SII), the world’s biggest vaccine-maker, put out a tweet begging President Joe Biden to “lift the embargo of raw material exports out of the US...Your administration has the details”. Suresh Jadhav, SII’s executive director, says “we are absolutely concerned,” and that in the next four to six weeks the production of two vaccines will be affected: AstraZeneca’s, of which SII makes 100m doses a month, and Novavax’s, of which it expects to make 60m-70m doses a month. SII says it first alerted the American government to the impending problem two months ago. That was shortly after the Biden administration announced, on February 5th, plans to use the Defence Production Act (DPA)—legislation that grants the president broad industrial-mobilisation powers—to bolster vaccine-making. This legislation has helped American pharmaceutical companies to secure raw materials and equipment needed to make more vaccines. But American firms that supply products essential to vaccine production say the DPA hinders their ability to export them. They must seek permission before exporting goods, which requires time and paperwork, and if America’s government decides they need the goods, firms may be barred from exporting them at all. Some are also concerned about pharma companies outside of America stockpiling goods because of concerns about delays caused by American export controls. Together, export controls and stockpiling risk gumming up the global supply chain. Vaccine production requires an array of special materials, including plastic tubing, raw goods, filters and even paper. Because all these items have to be specially approved by regulators to be used in medicine production, finding substitutes quickly can be impossible.

SII is not the only company to be concerned. Export controls also affect European vaccine producers, who need special bags from America in which to make their products. At a vaccine supply-chain meeting in early March, one European pharmaceutical company complained of 66-week delivery times for the supply of bags, commenting that it would be quicker to make a steel container to manufacture them in.

On March 24th, Micheál Martin, Ireland’s prime minister, warned that export bans (and not just from America) would undermine global vaccine production, and noted that the Pfizer vaccine involves 280 components from 86 suppliers in 19 countries. Richard Hatchett, head of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a global partnership to develop vaccines, says his organisation is “extremely concerned about constraints on global supply chains”.

CEPI is part of a new task force working with industry on this problem, and has also appealed to the World Trade Organisation for support. Its new head, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, held a high-level meeting this week, which concluded that stronger supply chains were critical to addressing global vaccine inequity.

If all goes swimmingly, the world could produce as many as 14bn doses of vaccine this year. But if vaccines and raw materials do not arrive where and when needed, production will fall grievously short of that estimate. Shortfalls in India will hinder its own vaccination programme, which is ramping up amidst an alarming second wave of infections—the country is recording more than 1,000 deaths per day from covid-19. And since India has banned the export of finished vaccines while it serves domestic needs, Mr Jadhav says that SII cannot fulfill its commitments to Covax, a global vaccine-sharing programme, and cannot deliver supplies to Europe and Britain.

At a time when many American states have a surplus of vaccines, with as many as one in three doses going unused, American export restrictions are not just galling. They may soon derail the plan to vaccinate the world.

Due to launch in October 2021 after years of delays, the new cutting-edge telescope could allow humanity to detect life signs on distant planets in as little as 60 hours, according to early calculations.

“What really surprised me about the results is that we may realistically find signs of life on other planets in the next 5 to 10 years,” said Caprice Phillips, a graduate student at the Ohio State University.

Phillips is due to present at the 2021 APS April Meeting on Sunday, to discuss exactly how the new eye in the sky might detect biosignatures on distant gas dwarf planets, which include both super-Earths and mini-Neptunes.

Phillips calculated that once the James Webb Space telescope becomes operational after its expected launch in October, it could detect ammonia signatures on approximately six gas dwarf planets in a matter of just a few orbits.

“Humankind has contemplated the questions, ‘Are we alone? What is life? Is life elsewhere similar to us?’” Phillips says.

“My research suggests that for the first time, we have the scientific knowledge and technological capabilities to realistically begin to find the answers to these questions.”

The JWST will peer into the distant past by observing far-away galaxies and other remote objects out in the wider universe, so even if it doesn’t find alien lifesigns right away, it will help humanity answer other fundamental questions about the origin and nature of the universe.

1,Bill Simmons Ventures Into Interdimensional Vortex To Find Out If LeBron James Could Dominate In Different NBA Eras,https://sports.theonion.com/bill-simmons-ventures-into-interdimensional-vortex-to-f-1819576589,"THE MULTIVERSE—Aiming to settle the longstanding debate over LeBron James’ place within basketball history, Grantland editor-in-chief Bill Simmons reportedly stepped into an interdimensional vortex Thursday to determine if the Miami Heat star would have dominated in other NBA eras.

Advertisement

Reports confirmed the longtime ESPN columnist created various ripples in the fabric of space-time and opened the door to an infinite cascade of universes in which James matched up against the best players from each period of NBA history.

“We can already label LeBron as the best player of his generation—that debate is all but over—but the big question is whether he would have been the top guy during the way more physical, pre-hand-check-rule NBA,” said Simmons, who reportedly warped through a cluster of dark matter to watch James face off against the Chicago Bulls in the 1991 Eastern Conference Finals as a member of Chuck Daly’s Detroit Pistons. “He just wouldn’t get the calls back then that he gets in 2014.”

“That said, even with players literally getting clotheslined while driving to the basket, LeBron is big enough and strong enough to cope with the physicality of the ’90s,” continued Simmons, carefully watching as James received the ball from Isaiah Thomas and then darted through Scottie Pippen and Bill Cartwright for a heavily contested dunk. “But I still can’t see him winning more than two championships while the Bulls were at their peak. He’d win, but he wouldn’t have a dynasty.”

Pinning the four-time MVP against a variety of iconic players such as Bill Russell, Jerry West, and Larry Bird, Simmons reportedly vibrated his subatomic particles through a number of time streams and planes of reality, enabling the sports columnist to venture across any conceivable point within limitless parallel universes in order to appraise the theoretical scenarios in person.

“LeBron is, in a lot of ways, the most complete player we’ve ever seen, especially in terms of pure physical attributes and basketball IQ,” Simmons said as every molecule in his body gradually materialized in the mouth of a Lorentzian traversable wormhole that opened courtside at the Forum in 1985. “And based on how he’s holding his own against Kareem [Abdul-Jabbar], who’s arguably the toughest player to guard ever, there’s no doubt that he would have been a powerhouse during the Magic-Bird era of the ’80s.”

Sources indicated that Simmons then manipulated the universal wave function to enter an isolated pocket dimension where Oscar Robertson, his body retroactively strengthened by modern 21st-century training methods and diet regimens, narrowly lost to James in a one-on-one game held in an endless expanse of empty white space. However, while occupying a Hubble volume within the Level III multiverse hypothesized by Dr. Max Tegmark, the 44-year-old sports writer reportedly questioned whether James would have been as prolific a scorer in the 1960s after seeing the 1964 Boston Celtics beat the 2012 Miami Heat in a 1010,000,000-game series.

“No one is questioning his skills, but he just doesn’t have that killer instinct that Jordan had,” Simmons said as a team of five 28-year-old Michael Jordans defeated five 28-year-old LeBron Jameses—a discovery that led the Grantland editor-in-chief to conclude that the Jordans were “clearly playing in full-blown ‘Eff You’ mode.” “LeBron’s definitely in the conversation of best player ever, but MJ is still at the top of the pyramid.”

“At the end of the day, Jordan is the CT to LeBron’s Adam on The Challenge—there’s only going to be one winner in a head-to-head matchup,” added Simmons, the dissonant echoes of his voice repeating at various octaves in an infinite, crescendoing loop.

According to reports, Simmons continued to venture into increasingly divergent quantum branches, at one point watching James record two touchdowns and 131 yards as a wide receiver for the Cleveland Browns during a regular-season loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Simmons reportedly went on to later—as well as earlier and simultaneously—travel at the speed of light along an arcwise-connected manifold and enter a timeline in which John F. Kennedy survived Lee Harvey Oswald’s 1963 assassination attempt and where a James-led Team USA subsequently won gold over the Soviet Union at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Baghdad.

“LeBron is obviously a Pantheon-level guy who would have been an All-Star in any decade,” said Simmons, his very being and consciousness spreading apart along a 26-dimensional space comprised of bosonic strings. “But the fact remains that he struggled to take ‘alpha dog’ status from Wilt Chamberlain when they played together on the San Francisco Warriors, and he was Robin to Jabari Parker’s Batman when the Milwaukee Bucks won their second straight championship in 2017.”

Hey, it might even be prudent. After all, you don’t want to be the one who’s caught off guard. So why not take a drive through town and clear out the shelves of every single store that sells the stuff?

0,Hong Kong Court Sentences Pro-Democracy Leaders to Prison,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/world/asia/hong-kong-martin-lee-jimmy-lai.html,"HONG KONG — Jimmy Lai has skewered the Chinese Communist Party for decades. The 73-year-old founder of a fiercely pro-democracy newspaper in Hong Kong, Mr. Lai helped give voice to critics of the city’s leaders and their bosses in Beijing, winning friends in Washington and other places along the way.

Now, for one of his acts of defiance, Mr. Lai is going to prison.

A Hong Kong court on Friday sentenced Mr. Lai to 12 months in prison for his role in a peaceful demonstration in 2019 against Beijing’s encroachment over the semiautonomous territory. Three activists and a labor leader were given sentences of eight to 18 months for their role in the protest.

Other prominent opposition figures received suspended sentences, meaning they would avoid being put behind bars if they are not convicted of another crime in the next two years. They included Martin Lee, an 82-year-old lawyer who is often called Hong Kong’s “father of democracy,” who was given an 11-month suspended term.

The sentences fell short of the maximum of five years in prison the defendants had faced. Still, they sent an unmistakable message that activism carries severe risks for even the most internationally prominent opposition figures. Supporters of the defendants say the sentences are the latest sign of the fundamental transformation that Beijing has sought to impose on Hong Kong, once a bastion of free speech, to silence dissent.",233,1417,8,57

RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — The global death toll from the coronavirus topped a staggering 3 million people Saturday amid repeated setbacks in the worldwide vaccination campaign and a deepening crisis in places such as Brazil, India and France.

The number of lives lost, as compiled by Johns Hopkins University, is about equal to the population of Kyiv, Ukraine; Caracas, Venezuela; or metropolitan Lisbon, Portugal. It is bigger than Chicago (2.7 million) and equivalent to Philadelphia and Dallas combined.

And the true number is believed to be significantly higher because of possible government concealment and the many cases overlooked in the early stages of the outbreak that began in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019.

When the world back in January passed the bleak threshold of 2 million deaths, immunization drives had just started in Europe and the United States. Today, they are underway in more than 190 countries, though progress in bringing the virus under control varies widely.

While the campaigns in the U.S. and Britain have hit their stride and people and businesses there are beginning to contemplate life after the pandemic, other places, mostly poorer countries but some rich ones as well, are lagging behind in putting shots in arms and have imposed new lockdowns and other restrictions as virus cases soar.

Worldwide, deaths are on the rise again, running at around 12,000 per day on average, and new cases are climbing too, eclipsing 700,000 a day.

“This is not the situation we want to be in 16 months into a pandemic, where we have proven control measures,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, one of the World Health Organization’s leaders on COVID-19.

In Brazil, where deaths are running at about 3,000 per day, accounting for one-quarter of the lives lost worldwide in recent weeks, the crisis has been likened to a “raging inferno” by one WHO official. A more contagious variant of the virus has been rampaging across the country.

As cases surge, hospitals are running out of critical sedatives. As a result, there have been reports of some doctors diluting what supplies remain and even tying patients to their beds while breathing tubes are pushed down their throats.

The slow vaccine rollout has crushed Brazilians’ pride in their own history of carrying out huge immunization campaigns that were the envy of the developing world.

Taking cues from President Jair Bolsonaro, who has likened the virus to little more than a flu, his Health Ministry for months bet big on a single vaccine, ignoring other producers. When bottlenecks emerged, it was too late to get large quantities in time.

Watching so many patients suffer and die alone at her Rio de Janeiro hospital impelled nurse Lidiane Melo to take desperate measures.

In the early days of the pandemic, as sufferers were calling out for comfort that she was too busy to provide, Melo filled two rubber gloves with warm water, knotted them shut, and sandwiched them around a patient’s hand to simulate a loving touch.

Some have christened the practice the “hand of God,” and it is now the searing image of a nation roiled by a medical emergency with no end in sight.

“Patients can’t receive visitors. Sadly, there’s no way. So it’s a way to provide psychological support, to be there together with the patient holding their hand,” Melo said. She added: “And this year it’s worse, the seriousness of patients is 1,000 times greater.”

This situation is similarly dire in India, where cases spiked in February after weeks of steady decline, taking authorities by surprise. In a surge driven by variants of the virus, India saw over 180,000 new infections in one 24-hour span during the past week, bringing the total number of cases to over 13.9 million.

Problems that India had overcome last year are coming back to haunt health officials. Only 178 ventilators were free Wednesday afternoon in New Delhi, a city of 29 million, where 13,000 new infections were reported the previous day.

The challenges facing India reverberate beyond its borders since the country is the biggest supplier of shots to COVAX, the U.N.-sponsored program to distribute vaccines to poorer parts of the world. Last month, India said it would suspend vaccine exports until the virus’s spread inside the country slows.

The WHO recently described the supply situation as precarious. Up to 60 countries might not receive any more shots until June, by one estimate. To date, COVAX has delivered about 40 million doses to more than 100 countries, enough to cover barely 0.25% of the world’s population.

Globally, about 87% of the 700 million doses dispensed have been given out in rich countries. While 1 in 4 people in wealthy nations have received a vaccine, in poor countries the figure is 1 in more than 500.

In recent days, the U.S. and some European countries put the use of Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine on hold while authorities investigate extremely rare but dangerous blood clots. AstraZeneca’s vaccine has likewise been hit with delays and restrictions because of a clotting scare.

Another concern: Poorer countries are relying on vaccines made by China and Russia, which some scientists believe provide less protection than those made by Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca.

Last week, the director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention acknowledged the country’s vaccines offer low protection and said officials are considering mixing them with other shots to improve their effectiveness.

In the U.S., where over 560,000 lives have been lost, accounting for more than 1 in 6 of the world’s COVID-19 deaths, hospitalizations and deaths have dropped, businesses are reopening, and life is beginning to return to something approaching normalcy in several states. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits tumbled last week to 576,000, a post-COVID-19 low.

But progress has been patchy, and new hot spots — most notably Michigan — have flared up in recent weeks. Still, deaths in the U.S. are down to about 700 per day on average, plummeting from a mid-January peak of about 3,400.

In Europe, countries are feeling the brunt of a more contagious variant that first ravaged Britain and has pushed the continent’s COVID-19-related death toll beyond 1 million.

Close to 6,000 gravely ill patients are being treated in French critical care units, numbers not seen since the first wave a year ago.

Full Coverage: Coronavirus pandemic

Dr. Marc Leone, head of intensive care at the North Hospital in Marseille, said exhausted front-line staff members who were feted as heroes at the start of the pandemic now feel alone and are clinging to hope that renewed school closings and other restrictions will help curb the virus in the coming weeks.

“There’s exhaustion, more bad tempers. You have to tread carefully because there are a lot of conflicts,” he said. “We’ll give everything we have to get through these 15 days as best we can.”

She was 88.

Hana Pokorna, a friend, confirmed the death and said that Mrs. Supikova had had breathing problems and Alzheimer’s disease and had recently overcome Covid-19.

Mrs. Supikova was 10 when Nazi forces arrived in Lidice, a village of about 500, on June 9, 1942. They were bent on avenging an attack by Czech parachutists on Reinhard Heydrich, a principal architect of the “final solution,” the Nazis’ plan to annihilate the Jewish people, which led to his death on June 4.

Looking to eradicate Lidice (LID-it-seh), the Nazis destroyed all the village’s buildings. They killed nearly 200 men, including Mrs. Supikova’s father, by a firing squad against a barn wall cushioned by mattresses. The women, including Mrs. Supikova’s mother, were sent to the Ravensbrück concentration camp in Germany.",169,1039,12,68

Most aren’t running yet",https://scroll.in/article/992537/india-is-running-out-of-oxygen-covid-19-patients-are-dying-because-the-government-wasted-time,"Vinay Srivastava’s oxygen saturation level was dangerously low when he tweeted around 8 pm on April 16 to say that no hospital in Lucknow was responding to his phone calls.

Oxygen saturation in the blood below the level of 94 is considered a matter of concern for people suffering from Covid-19. Srivastava said his level was 52.

As the 65-year-old freelance journalist’s complaint went viral on Twitter, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister’s media advisor responded to him next afternoon, asking for more details. By then, Srivastava’s oxygen levels had fallen to 31.

At 4.20 pm on Saturday, his son, Harshit Srivastava, tweeted to say his father had died – waiting for an ambulance. “We did not get anything,” he told Scroll.in on the phone. “I called every number for an oxygen cylinder but no one picked up.”

About 7 km from their home, the government-run Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Civil Hospital has been waiting for an oxygen generation plant. It is one of 150 district hospitals across India for which the Central government floated tenders in October, eight months into the coronavirus pandemic, to create units that can produce medical oxygen on site.

But six months later, the oxygen plant is yet to be installed. Had it been in place, breathless Lucknow residents like Srivastava would have stood a better chance of surviving Covid-19. The city of three million people currently has 44,485 confirmed coronavirus cases.

“My father could have been saved,” said Harshit Shrivastava, who was still awaiting his father’s Covid-19 report, hours after his death. “It is entirely the government’s fault.”

About 1,200 km away, in Navsari, Gujarat, another district hospital due to get an oxygen generation plant has had to refuse admission in the last few days to several Covid-19 patients who required oxygen.

“There is a full shortage of oxygen,” said Avnish Dube, the chief medical officer of the district’s 175-bedded MGG General Hospital. Last week, five Covid-19 patients died in a private hospital reportedly due to lack of oxygen – despite the district’s official case load being barely over 500.

Had the oxygen plant been in place, Navsari could have even catered to patients from Surat, one of the worst affected cities in Gujarat, less than an hour away. But, currently, when nearby hospitals contact him, Dube said, “I have had to tell them, ‘Don’t send them here.’”

Eight months to float tenders worth Rs 200 crore

India declared the coronavirus pandemic to be a “disaster” on March 14, 2020. Ten days later, over a billion people were put under the world’s most severe lockdown, with the government arguing it needed time to expand the country’s healthcare capacity.

Early in the pandemic, it became clear that oxygen would be one of the most precious commodities in the battle against the virus. Yet, it took the Narendra Modi government eight months to invite bids for new oxygen generation plants.

On October 21, the Central Medical Services Society, an autonomous institution under the Union health ministry, floated a tender online calling for bidders to establish Pressure Swing Adsorption oxygen plants in 150 district hospitals across the country. The PSA technology separates gases from a mixture in the atmosphere to generate concentrated oxygen that can be supplied to hospital beds through a pipeline, negating the need for hospitals to buy pressurised liquid oxygen from other sources.

It seems unlikely that the delay in kickstarting the tender process was caused by a lack of funds: the outlay for 162 oxygen plants (12 plants seem to have been added later) is just Rs 201.58 crore. The money has been allocated from the PM-Cares corpus – the Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations fund, which had received over Rs 3,000 crore in donations within four days after it was set up on March 27, 2020.

Now, with a deadly second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic sweeping through the country, the Modi government said in a statement on Thursday that another 100 oxygen plants will be established out of the PM-Cares fund. On the status of 162 oxygen plants for which contracts were given in 2020, all it said was that they were “being closely reviewed for early completion of 100 percent of the plants”.

Questions sent to the Central Medical Services Society and the Union health ministry enquiring about the status of the 162 oxygen plants, went unanswered at the time of publication.

But an independent investigation by Scroll.in revealed a disturbing picture of mounting delays. We called more than 60 hospitals across 14 states where the new oxygen plants are expected to come up. Only 11 units had been installed and just five were operational, as per interviews with hospital officials.

Update: Two hours after this article was published, the health ministry put out a series of tweets, confirming that most new oxygen plants were not functional. “Out of 162 PSA Oxygen plants, 33 have been installed,” it said. “By end of April, 2021, 59 will be installed. By end of May, 2021, 80 will be installed.” It is likely the ministry meant a total of 80 plants will be installed by end of May – less than half the number of new sanctioned plants – because the numbers would otherwise add up to 172 plants.

With nearly two million people currently infected with coronavirus in India, oxygen is running out, despite many states redirecting all industrial oxygen production to medical purposes. The government said on Thursday it would import 50,000 metric tonnes of medical oxygen.

The new oxygen plants would have added a capacity of over 4,500 metric tonnes of oxygen per month. This would still have proven inadequate to meet the demand currently seen in the second wave but every additional capacity could have saved lives.

“Even if Covid-19 had not been there, these plants should be there,” said T Sundararaman, former director of the National Health Systems Resource Centre, an advisory body of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

Public health experts like him have argued that the pandemic is an opportunity for India to fill the glaring gaps in its healthcare systems, one of them being the absence of piped oxygen in district hospitals that cater to lakhs of people.

“We have had tragedy after tragedy because of lack of oxygen,” Sundararaman said. This includes deaths due to snake bites, encephalitis, road accidents, among other causes.

Hundreds of thousands of such deaths could have been avoided had piped oxygen been available through on-site generation plants, which as the recent bids have showed, come at a small cost – just Rs 200 crore for over 150 hospitals.

But now Covid-19 is adding to this death roll.

Mounting delays as hospitals and companies trade charges

What explains the delay in installing the oxygen plants when infrastructure should have been ramped up on war footing during a pandemic?

Scroll.in spoke to hospital officials in 14 states – Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and West Bengal. Most officials blamed the companies that had won the contracts for the delays.

In the tender document for the new oxygen plants, district hospitals were listed along with the total number of beds in the hospital and the capacity of the plant. Out of these, Uttar Pradesh was allotted the highest number of plants with varying capacities in 14 districts. It was followed by Maharashtra, which was allotted plants in 10 districts. Delhi was allotted eight plants with a total capacity of generating 7,700 litres of oxygen per minute.

The contracts were awarded to at least three companies – Uttam Air Products, Airox Technologies and Absstem Technologies – according to the information provided by district officials at the hospitals Scroll.in contacted.

In Uttar Pradesh, not one of the 14 hospitals reported having a functional oxygen plant.

SR Singh of Lucknow’s Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Civil Hospital accused the company that won the contract of “fleeing after installing the plant”.

“They have done nothing after that,” he said. “We will now connect pipes and make it operational on our own.”

Gyanendra Kumar of Meerut’s LLRM Medical College said: “We allocated a site for the plant, but the machine is yet to come. I have phoned the company several times, but there is no response.”

In both cases, the contract had been won by Absstem Technologies, a company registered in Delhi. Even MGG general hospital in Navsari, Gujarat, identified Absstem as the company that won the contract but failed to show up. “We keep calling them, they keep saying they would call back,” said Avnish Dube, the chief medical officer of the hospital. “I don’t know what the problem is.”

Scroll.in was unable to contact any official of Absstem since phone numbers and email addresses mentioned on the company website were unresponsive. This article will be updated if the company responds.

Another company that bagged orders to install the new oxygen plants is the Aurangabad-based Airox Technologies. Its founder Sanjay Jaiswal claimed the company had finished all procedures on its end. But the new units were delayed because hospitals, he claims, were yet to provide the infrastructure needed to connect the generation units to the beds.

“From our side, our 60 engineers were aggressive, it is almost done,” he said. “But states need to provide us all copper pipeline connection and electricity. That is not in our hand. Unless they give us that, we cannot start the system.”

Across the states, however, most hospitals insisted they had all the infrastructure ready. “On January 13, I sent the company a mail saying the site is ready,” said Dr Niyati Lakhani of GMERS Medical College and General Hospital, Gandhinagar. “I have not heard back despite several follow-ups. We desperately need it up and running. We just are not being able to manage with cylinders.”

The company contracted to carry out work in Gandhinagar was Delhi-based Uttam Air Products, which Scroll.in found had been blacklisted by the Central Medical Services Society on April 13. A letter by Central Medical Services Society, reviewed by Scroll.in, states the company had not submitted its security deposit or accepted letters of acceptance after winning the contract.

When we broke that news to Lakhani, she said in resignation: “If Uttam is blacklisted then where should I get oxygen from?”

The company’s founder Manish Kapoor declined to comment on the matter. “You already have the letter from CMSS,” Kapoor said. “I think they will be the better people to answer that. We are vendors and we have assisted them in various technical inputs related to those tenders.”

As the delays escalate, smaller hospitals in fur-flung areas are particularly impacted. It is extremely difficult for them to procure oxygen cylinders when supply lines are choked. They are simply unable to compete with bigger players with deeper pockets. These hospitals would have been better equipped to care for severely-ill patients had a local source of production been up and running.

As Ungender, the medical superintendent of the Area Hospital in Telangana’s Bhadrachalam, a district that is home to a large Adivasi population, put it: “When we are purchasing oxygen from outside, we are running huge bills. But if we produce at site, it will reduce our burden.”

After all, as Ungender said, all it took to produce oxygen, once a plant was functional, was air.

Shortages lead to death spiral

Doctors across India say the second wave might prove more lethal, not because new variants of the virus were causing more severe disease (there is no clear evidence on this yet), but simply because a higher case-load would make it harder for patients to get admission to hospital. And even those admitted to hospitals might have to go without oxygen.

The lack of medical oxygen, said doctors in Gujarat, had forcing them into a “triage-like situation” – by which they meant they had to pick between patients, all of whom required oxygen, but only some could be given it.

“Last time we were able to meet the requirements,” said Dr Roopam Gupta of CU Shah Medical College and Hospital in Surendranagar district in Gujarat, “but this year the wave has come so suddenly with a steep rise so at the moment we are only making our ends meet.”

The hospital has 700 beds out of which nearly 200 were occupied on Friday by Covid-19 patients and almost all of them needed oxygen, Gupta said. The hospital has kept two trolleys with 100 oxygen cylinders on standby along with fire engineers manning the vicinity. “It [oxygen] is in such high flow that we are afraid that a disaster [could] take place,” he said.

This time around, doctors were using a new treatment termed high flow nasal therapy, which requires higher amounts of oxygen per patient. “The problem is once a patient goes on high flow then a single patient requires 130 litres per minute of oxygen, so it sucks out the capacity,” Gupta explained. “Even if one patient requires high flow, we have to balance the benefits with 50 others who are surviving on oxygen at 16 litres per minute.”

Many doctors at the district hospitals which are waiting for the new oxygen plants conceded they had stopped following up with the companies because for a while it seemed the worst was over. After reaching a daily-high of about 10 lakh cases in September, Covid-19 cases in India had been falling steadily till February.

“We became a little less serious,” said Sanghamitra K Phule, civil surgeon at Ratnagiri district hospital in Maharashtra. “But now in April, things have become even more serious.”

The oxygen plant at the hospital is now its final stages of installation – a result of soaring demand. “Our requirement has increased by four times,” said Phule. “So even if the plant is not enough by itself to meet our demand, something is better than nothing.”

Running on empty cylinders

While oxygen generation plants are not adequate to serve the needs of bigger hospitals with a higher number of critical patients, they could be a useful tool in the armoury in times of high demand, said doctors. This is especially the case when there is an acute shortage of commercial oxygen across the country.

Ten manufacturers and oxygen cylinder suppliers in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh told Scroll.in that the demand was much higher in the second wave than it had been during the first wave of Covid-19 cases last year.

“Medical oxygen is in shortage,” said Sunil Gupta who runs Raigad Carbides, an oxygen manufacturing firm that has buyers in western India. Before the pandemic, Gupta’s firm would supply oxygen mostly to industries. But now the entire production was being diverted for medical use, he said.

Subasish Guha Roy of Universal Air Products said his firm, which supplies 60 metric tonne oxygen within Karnataka to cities like Bengaluru and Mysore, was running at its full capacity. “It will be difficult to meet daily needs if a high demand continues,” he said.

Even cylinder suppliers said their stocks had run out quickly. “In the last 15 days the demand was three times what it usually is,” said Chirag Vasani of Laxmi Gas Suppliers in Surat, Gujarat. Vasani has been supplying at least 200 cylinders daily within Surat. “This is only because of coronavirus,” he said.

A medical oxygen cylinder supplier in Lucknow did not respond to calls when Scroll.in contacted him on Thursday. Within a minute, he sent a text message: the cylinders were sold out.

Another supplier in Lucknow, Kaushal Katiyar, said he had lost count of the number of cylinders he had sold over the past week. “If there is a patient in every house then you can just imagine what the demand is like,” he said. “I have stopped picking calls.”",2741,16497,31,181

The opposition organised anti-Kremlin rallies across the country in response, sparking a violent crackdown from police and thousands of detentions, before deciding to pause the street protest movement.

“Right now he is being killed in a prison colony. We can’t wait any longer,” Navalny ally Leonid Volkov said as he announced further demonstrations in all major Russian cities for Wednesday evening, shortly after President Vladimir Putin gives his annual state of the nation address.

More than 450,000 people have already registered to take part in the events. While the number is shy of a previously announced target of half a million, the figure suggests that Wednesday could see the country’s biggest protests since the collapse of the Soviet Union three decades ago.

“Have you seen a person being killed with your own eyes? You have. You are seeing it now,” Mr Volkov said in a video released via the opposition leader’s YouTube channel on Sunday.

“No matter how much you want to escape that thought, to change the topic - that does not change the fact that Alexei Navalny is being killed. Using terrible means. In front of all of us.”

Doctors said that the levels of potassium in Mr Navalny’s blood were significantly higher than the level that usually requires medical intervention. “This means both impaired renal function and that serious heart problems can develop at any minute,” his personal doctor Anastasia Vasilyeva said in a statement.

Mr Navalny has tried to keep an upbeat tone in messages passed to his lawyers and posted on social media, in which he has joked about his routine in prison.

But he has also told of how prison guards wake him once an hour throughout the night, and of threats to put him in a straight-jacket and force-feed him if he does not end his hunger strike.

The EU said it would discuss Mr Navalny’s case at a meeting of foreign ministers on Monday, as French President Emmanuel Macron said it was time to draw “clear red lines” in relation to Russia, a shift away from his usual conciliatory tone.

The EU said it was ""deeply concerned"" about Mr Navalny's failing health, while a senior Biden administration official warned that Russia would face repercussions if he died.

""We have communicated to the Russian government that what happens to Mr Navalny in their custody is their responsibility and they will be held accountable by the international community,"" Jake Sullivan, Joe Biden's national security adviser, said on CNN's State of the Union.

Both the EU and the US have sanctioned Moscow over its treatment of the opposition leader.

Mr Navalny has long accused the Kremlin of orchestrating his poisoning, and last year appeared to trick an FSB agent into admitting details of the attempted killing during a sting call.

Since his jailing, authorities have kept up pressure on the opposition movement, raiding his offices and placing a number of Mr Navalny’s key allies under house arrest. Last week, prosecutors moved to label his organisation an “extremist group”, meaning supporters could face lengthy jail terms.",553,3322,11,73

Sputnik/Alexei Druzhinin/Kremlin via REUTERS

Russia on Friday asked 10 U.S. diplomats to leave the country in retaliation for Washington's expulsion of the same number of Russian diplomats over alleged malign activity and suggested the U.S. ambassador return home for consultations.

The measures, part of a broader retaliatory package, were approved by President Vladimir Putin, as a response to an array of U.S. government sanctions imposed on Moscow a day earlier, including curbs to its sovereign debt market. read more

Though Moscow responded swiftly and with measures designed to hurt U.S. interests and shrink its diplomatic footprint, it left the door open for dialogue and did not kill off the idea, proposed by President Joe Biden, of a Putin-Biden summit.

""Now is the time for the United States to demonstrate good sense and to turn its back on a confrontational course,"" the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement.

""Otherwise an array of painful decisions for the American side will be implemented.""

It said it had options to hurt the United States economically and to shrink its diplomatic corps in Russia to just 300 people, but was holding fire for now.

Russia-U.S. ties slumped to a new post-Cold War low last month after Biden said he thought Putin was a ""killer"" and Moscow recalled its ambassador to Washington for consultations. The envoy has still not returned almost a month later.

The Russian foreign ministry said John Sullivan, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, should return home for consultations too.

Washington said its own sanctions were payback for Russia interfering in last year's U.S. election, cyber hacking, bullying Ukraine and other alleged malign actions.

Russia denies all the U.S. allegations.

The Russian response on Friday was ""escalatory and regrettable,"" a State Department representative said by email.

""It is not in our interest to get into an escalatory cycle, but we reserve the right to respond to any Russian retaliation against the United States.""

RETALIATION

Moscow's response was mostly tit-for-tat.

It expelled 10 U.S. diplomats and banned eight high-ranking current and former U.S. officials from entering Russia for their contribution to what it called Washington's ""anti-Russian course"".

Those banned included FBI Director Christopher Wray, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas.

Others to face an entry ban were Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons Michael Carvajal, Director of the Domestic Policy Council Susan Rice, John Bolton, the former U.S. National Security Advisor, and ex-CIA head Robert James Woolsey.

The Russian foreign ministry said it would also end the activity in Russia of U.S. funds and NGOs which it believes interfere in the country's internal affairs, while Sergei Lavrov, the foreign minister, spoke of potential ""painful"" measures aimed at U.S. business in Russia.

Other measures were designed to make it harder for the U.S. embassy to staff itself.

Biden, after imposing sanctions on Moscow, had called for a de-escalation in tensions and had said it was vital the White House and Kremlin kept communication lines open.

He has also proposed that he and Putin meet for a summit.

""(Putin) has repeatedly said we're ready to develop dialogue as much as our counterparts are ready to do so. In this sense it is probably positive that the views of the two heads of state coincide,"" Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman, told reporters before the Russian counter sanctions were unveiled.

""Their views categorically do not coincide when it comes to creating mutually beneficial relations and taking each other's interests into account,"" Peskov added, however.

The foreign ministry said Biden's Putin summit proposal had been initially well received, but was now being studied in the context of unfolding events.

""We would like to avoid a further escalation with the United States. We are ready for calm and professional dialogue,"" the ministry said.

""However the reality is that we hear one thing from Washington and in practice we see something completely different. There should be no doubt - not a single sanctions 'wave' will remain unpunished.""

The Kremlin says Putin has yet to decide whether he will take part in a U.S.-led climate summit next week.

It has also said it would be hard to quickly organise a Putin-Biden summit.

The Costs of War Project, housed at Brown University’s Watson Institute and Boston University’s Pardee Center, noted in its report that the financial cost included both Afghan operations and those in neighboring Pakistan.



President Joe Biden announced on Wednesday that all U.S. troops will leave Afghanistan by September 11, the 20th anniversary of the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, saying “it is time to end the forever war.” The drawdown of around 3,000 remaining troops from the country, Biden said, would begin on May 1.



“The Costs of War Project also estimates that 241,000 people have died as a direct result of this war. This includes at least 71,344 civilians; 2,442 American service members; 78,314 Afghan military and police; and 84,191 opposition fighters,” the report said.

FILE - U.S. troops patrol at an Afghan National Army base in Logar province, Afghanistan, Aug. 7, 2018.

It noted that the numbers are approximations based on the reporting of several data sources.



“These horrific numbers are testament to the costs of war, first to the Afghan people, and then to the soldiers and people of the United States. Ending the war as soon as possible is the only rational and humane thing to do,” said Catherine Lutz, co-director of Costs of War and professor at Brown University.



Neta Crawford, the project’s lead researcher and professor at Boston University, described as ""the tip of the iceberg” the U.S. Department of Defense spending of more than $900 billion in Afghanistan.



The rest of the money, according to the report, includes an increase of $443 billion in the Pentagon’s base budget to support the war, $296 billion to care for veterans, $530 billion to cover the interest on the money borrowed to fund the military deployments in the South Asian nation, and $59 billion in overseas contingency funds.

“The costs of the Afghanistan war include its escalation into Pakistan, millions of refugees and displaced persons, the toll in lives of combatants and non-combatants, and the need to care for America’s veterans,” Crawford noted.



Pakistan, which joined the U.S.-led military invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, conducted military operations to secure its side of the nearly 2,600-kilometer largely porous border in support of actions by international troops on the Afghan side.



Washington reimbursed Islamabad for the financial costs Pakistani operations incurred from a Coalition Support Fund set up for the purpose.



The Costs of War Project noted that the total estimated $2.26 trillion does not include funds that the U.S. government is obligated to spend on lifetime care for American veterans of the Afghan war, nor does it include future interest payments on money borrowed to fund the war.



A more comprehensive accounting is yet to be completed, the report said. It would include not just money that may or may not have been well spent, but the count of those wounded, those who lost limbs, and the psychological toll of decades of war on combatants and non-combatants and their families.



Stephanie Savell, the project’s co-director and senior research associate, replied in affirmative when asked by VOA whether their researchers had spoken to relevant U.S. administration departments while conducting the study.



“We have spoken with representatives of the administration about this, yes,” Savell said. “Our total number includes the DOD OCO budget (the figure the Pentagon uses to estimate total war costs), but also other ledger items like care for vets, interest on war borrowing, and increases to the Pentagon's base budget due to war,” she explained in a written reply.



The Costs of War Project was launched 10 years ago by a group of scholars and experts to document the “unacknowledged costs” of the post-9/11 wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere, said Friday’s release.

Polish game studio CD Projekt Red just told OGN that they’ve completely eliminated the need for crunch on their upcoming Cyberpunk 2077 by breeding a race of grotesque human-rat hybrids that can work as programmers for weeks on end without the need for sleep or food.

If you had any nagging reservations about picking up this ultra-hyped open-world RPG, you can kiss those worries goodbye!

“We’ve listened to complaints about how hard crunch can be on human programmers, and we want fans to rest assured that we’ve been able to address those head-on with our new coding team of humanoid rodents,” said lead designer Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, noting that immediately after the release of The Witcher 3, a scientific team got to work in the studio’s basement breeding the hairless, 8-foot-tall rat hybrids for intelligence, endurance, and an aptitude for a wide range of programming languages. “What’s incredible is that even as they work at eight times the rate of a typical coder, these transhuman workers don’t even think of accepting benefits or taking a bathroom break.”

“Essentially, these abominations have been built for the sole purpose of making Cyberpunk 2077, and they will die soon after their task is finished,” he added.

Tomaszkiewicz went on to describe his optimism that their hard work would ensure Cyberpunk 2077 will be delivered on time and in good shape, stressing that the rodential abominations had no need to eat or drink while coding due to an intravenous drip fed directly into their wrinkled, highly deformed bodies.

He added that the long-tailed, flesh-toned creatures only had the ability to communicate through what sounded like human screaming, which made them all but incapable of unionizing or sharing concerns with HR.

“What fans should be most excited about is that we’ve removed the part of their rodent brains that would even allow them to think of a life beyond making sure that Night City is the perfect sandbox for RPG fanatics,” he said, adding that any moment the hybrids do not spend crafting a AAA gaming experience is experienced as a sharp, increasingly unpleasant, throbbing pain in the man-rodent’s skull. “And if that’s not enough, we’re on track to sell the game for $10 off its list price thanks to their tireless efforts.”

The agreement between the two NATO allies will let the U.S. build facilities at three Norwegian airfields and one naval base, but will not amount to separate U.S. bases, the government said.

The deal made by the minority government of Prime Minister Erna Solberg must be ratified by Norway's parliament before coming into force.

""The agreement regulates and facilitates U.S. presence, training and exercises in Norway, thus facilitating rapid U.S. reinforcement of Norway in the event of crisis or war,"" the government said.

Relations between Norway and Russia, which share an Arctic border, gradually improved in the post-Cold War era before suffering a setback when Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014.

That triggered tension in the north with a military build-up on both sides of the border and more frequent military manoeuvres, but both nations also seek to cooperate on local matters such as cross-border travel and fisheries.

Since joining NATO as a founding member in 1949, Norway has said it would not allow foreign bases to be established in peacetime or the stockpiling of nuclear arms, although Western troops are welcome to exercise on its soil.

""Our cooperation with our allies is under continuous development. The agreement reaffirms Norway's close relationship with the U.S. and confirms Norway's key position on the northern flank of NATO,"" Foreign Minister Ine Eriksen Soereide said.

""Our policies regarding the stationing of foreign forces on Norwegian territory, the stockpiling or deployment of nuclear weapons and port visits remain unchanged,"" she said.

In fact, had the Great Washington Fire of 1964 not provided them with room to grow, the Departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development would never have been able to take root and thrive.” The study concluded that attempts to suppress the wildfires would likely only lead to the occurrence of far more powerful blazes in the future capable of causing significant, permanent damage to the government’s branches.",197,1300,12,101

Washington and NATO have been alarmed by the large build-up of Russian troops near Ukraine and in Crimea, the peninsula that Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014, and two U.S. warships are due to arrive in the Black Sea this week.

Russia — which said the U.S. naval move was an unfriendly provocation and warned Washington to stay far away from Crimea and its Black Sea coast — says the build-up is a three-week snap military drill to test combat readiness in response to what it calls threatening behavior from NATO. It has said the exercise is due to wrap up within two weeks.

Ahead of the arrival of the U.S. warships, the Russian navy on Wednesday began a drill in the Black Sea that rehearsed firing at surface and air targets. The drill came a day after NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called on Moscow to end its troop build-up.

In Ukraine, armed forces rehearsed repelling a tank and infantry attack near the border of Russian-annexed Crimea while its defense minister, Andrii Taran, told European parliamentarians in Brussels that Russia was preparing to potentially store nuclear weapons in Crimea.

Taran provided no evidence for his assertion but said Russia was massing 110,000 troops on Ukraine’s border in 56 battalion-sized tactical groups, citing Kyiv’s latest intelligence.

Clashes in eastern Ukraine

Fighting has increased in recent weeks in eastern Ukraine, where government forces have battled Russian-backed separatists in a seven-year conflict that Kyiv says has killed 14,000 people.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who held talks in Brussels with Stoltenberg ahead of a video conference of all 30 NATO allies, said the alliance would “address Russia’s aggressive actions in and around Ukraine”, without elaborating.

Russia’s relations with the United States slumped to a new post-Cold War low last month after U.S. President Joe Biden said he thought Vladimir Putin was a “killer”.

In a phone call with Putin on Tuesday, Biden proposed holding a summit between the estranged leaders to tackle a raft of issues, including reducing tensions over Ukraine.

The Kremlin on Wednesday said it was too early to talk about such a summit in tangible terms and that holding such a meeting was contingent on Washington’s future behaviour, in what looked like a thinly veiled reference to potential U.S. sanctions.

Russia has regularly accused NATO of destabilizing Europe by bolstering its troops in the Baltic countries and Poland – all members of the Atlantic alliance – in the wake of Moscow’s annexation of Crimea.

NATO has denied a claim by Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu that the alliance was deploying 40,000 troops and 15,000 pieces of military equipment near Russia’s borders, mainly in the Black Sea and the Baltic regions.

0,Spain’s Endesa power firm sued over electrocution of birds. Landmark case says thousands of birds including endangered eagles die needlessly each year,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/16/spains-power-company-endesa-sued-over-electrocution-of-birds,"In Leonard Cohen’s famous song, a bird on a wire is a symbol of freedom, but for thousands of birds it is the equivalent of being sent to the electric chair.

Now, in a landmark case, a Spanish electricity company is being prosecuted over the deaths of hundreds of birds electrocuted on pylons and overhead cables and for failing to comply with regulations designed to protect wildlife.

After a three-year investigation, Antoni Pelegrín, the attorney general for the environment in Barcelona, has brought a case for ecological crimes against the electricity company Endesa and six of its senior executives for allegedly failing to meet safety requirements.

The lawsuit claims that between 2018 and 2020 255 birds were electrocuted on pylons near Osona in northern Catalonia. Most were storks, eagles, peregrine falcons and vultures.

Separately, over three days in August 2018, 72 migrating white storks were electrocuted in Sant Quirze de Besora, also in northern Catalonia. A further 93 were electrocuted in the area between 2019 and 2020.

This is a worldwide problem but it is particularly severe in Spain because the Iberian peninsula and the strait of Gibraltar lie on one of the principal avian migratory routes, with millions of birds crossing the Pyrenees every year.

According to the Spanish Ornithology Society (SEO), electrocution is the most common cause of death of golden and Bonelli’s eagles, both of which are endangered species. It is estimated that around 33,000 birds of prey are electrocuted every year in Spain.

While small birds may face little risk, for larger species there is the danger that when they spread their wings they touch an inadequately insulated pylon and become, fatally, part of the circuit.

Nicólas López, the SEO’s species conservation officer who was involved in investigating the case against Endesa, told the Guardian there are thousands of dangerous towers in Spain and approximately a million kilometres of electric cables.

“These cause the death not only of thousands of birds through electrocution but our report estimates around 5 million die through colliding with the cables,” he said.

“In France it’s thought that at least 1 million birds are electrocuted each year. A government report suggests that the figure in Spain is nearer 3 million.

“We’ve known about the problem and the measures that need to be taken to prevent electrocution since the 1980s, but they’re still putting up new lines that don’t comply with the regulations,” he said.

He adds that there’s little political will to put pressure on these companies, which are among the most powerful in Spain.

The cost of complying during the erection of new pylons is trivial, López says, but it is more expensive for existing pylons.

In the suit, Pelegrín points out that Endesa is subject to laws that oblige it “to adopt the necessary measures to avoid risks or damage incurred through transporting electricity not only to people but the flora, fauna and the environment in general”.

In 2013, Endesa presented the Catalan regional government with a plan to ensure its power lines conformed with legal requirements. However, the suit contends that, five years later, the company had only made piecemeal adjustments to its lines despite “having been required and repeatedly informed of the need to carry out a serious and effective plan to make safe these dangerous installations”.

The company, which has not formally responded to the charge, claims that this year it will invest €4.6m (£4m) in bird protection and that in 2020 it made safe 659 pylons at a cost of €2.2m.

In 2018, in a historic ruling, a court in Castilla-La Mancha fined an electricity company €149,920 for causing the death by electrocution of an Iberian imperial eagle, which is an endangered species.

López hopes the case against Endesa will increase pressure on companies to comply with environmental regulations.

“We think this case is really important because it isn’t just against the company but also brings criminal charges against six of its senior executives,” he said. “This makes it different from just fining the company, the cost of which they pass on to the consumer anyway. But we know they have a lot of money to hire lawyers and could drag the case out for years.”",720,4407,22,150

Moscow has repeatedly dismissed these allegations as lacking any proof and harmful for bilateral relations.

The United States sees Russia's announcement of response actions as ""escalatory"" and reserves the right to retaliate, a State Department spokesperson told Sputnik.

""Today's announcement by the Russian government was escalatory and regrettable,"" the spokesperson said on Friday. ""It is not in our interest to get into an escalatory cycle, but we reserve the right to respond to any Russian retaliation against the United States.""

On Friday, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced a response, which included barring eight current and former US officials from entering the country in retaliation for the new US sanctions and expulsions of Russian diplomats. Moscow noted that now is the time for the United States to demonstrate prudence by abandoning its confrontational stance toward Russia.

A new batch of sanctions was introduced by Washington over already long-standing allegations of interference in the US election and Moscow's alleged role in the SolarWinds cyberattack. Biden claimed on Thursday that he ""could have gone further"" with the sanctions, but ""chose to be proportionate"".

The Russian Foreign Ministry said the US government's actions were contrary to its declared intention to build pragmatic relations with Russia, and notified US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan that Moscow's retaliatory measures would be announced soon.

US-Russia relations suffered a downturn following Joe Biden's controversial remarks in an interview with ABC News in March. In particular, the US president threatened that his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin would ""pay a price"" for alleged election meddling and answered in the affirmative when asked whether he considered Putin a ""killer.""

While data from the Health Ministry suggest that over 800 children under age 9 have died of Covid-19, including about 500 babies, experts say the real death toll is higher because cases are underreported because of a lack of widespread coronavirus testing, according to the BBC, which first reported the story.

Dr. Fatima Marinho of the University of São Paolo, a leading epidemiologist who is a senior adviser to the international non-governmental organization Vital Strategies, estimated that the virus has killed 2,060 children under 9, including 1,302 babies. Her estimate is based on the number of excess deaths from an unspecified acute respiratory syndrome during the pandemic.

There is a misconception that children are at zero risk for Covid-19, Marinho told the BBC after she found that there have been 10 times more deaths from an unexplained respiratory syndrome over the past year compared to previous years.

Marinho added that, throughout her research, she has seen a rise in cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome among Brazilian children. The rare syndrome is a newly identified and serious health condition associated with the virus that causes Covid-19 infections. It tends to affect children up to six weeks after they are infected with the coronavirus.

Brazil has become the country with the second-highest number of Covid-19 deaths, more than 361,000 since the pandemic began, the most in the world after the United States.

Médecins Sans Frontières, or Doctors Without Borders in English, said Thursday that the government's ""failed response"" to the pandemic had led to thousands of avoidable deaths.

""More than one year into the Covid-19 pandemic, the failed response in Brazil has caused a humanitarian catastrophe,"" Dr. Christos Christou, president of Doctors Without Borders, said in a briefing with reporters. ""Each week there is a grim new record of deaths and infections — the hospitals are overflowing, and yet there is still no coordinated centralized response.""

Last week, more than a quarter of the world's coronavirus deaths were in Brazil. Christou said he expects the situation to worsen in the coming weeks if nothing changes.

So far, right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro, who has opposed lockdowns, has held large events where he often does not wear a mask. He has only recently embraced vaccines as a possible solution.

Experts in Brazil say low coronavirus testing rates, lack of contact tracing efforts and a shortage of vaccines have contributed to rises in cases and deaths. These factors have also increased the risk of exposure and potential death among more Brazilian babies and children.

""Their refusal to adapt evidence-based public health measures has sent far too many to an early grave. The response in Brazil needs an urgent, science-based and well-coordinated reset to prevent further avoidable deaths and the destruction of the once prestigious Brazilian health system,"" Christou said in a statement Thursday.

Pfizer recently announced updated results indicating its vaccine was highly effective up to six months after the second dose, with findings stemming from over 12,000 participants in a late-stage trial. Findings included a 91.3% vaccine efficacy against COVID-19, and over 95% efficacy against severe disease.

In February, the company began testing whether a third shot could offer greater protection against emerging strains of the virus, like the concerning strain first detected in South Africa.

A man identified by police as Brandon Hole, 19, opened fire outside a FedEx warehouse facility in Indianapolis late Thursday night before moving inside the facility, killing eight people and injuring several others. Hole is believed to have shot himself and is among the nine dead, according to police.

""FedEx officials have confirmed that Mr. Hole was an employee at the facility and that he was last employed in 2020,"" Indianapolis Deputy Police Chief Craig McCartt said.

Friday evening, police released the names of those who were killed. They have been identified as Matthew R. Alexander,32, Samaria Blackwell, 19, Amarjeet Johal, 66, Jaswinder Kaur, 64, Jaswinder Singh, 68, Amarjit Sekhon, 48, Karlie Smith, 19, and John Weisert, 74.

The Sikh Coalition said four of the victims were Sikh and described the facility as ""known to be heavily populated by Sikh employees."" The group estimates that 8,000-10,000 Sikhs live in Indiana.

McCartt said, ""This suspect came to this facility, got out of his car and quickly began some random shooting.""

McCartt said investigators are trying to determine the motive.

Federal Bureau of Investigation Indianapolis Special Agent in Charge Paul Keenan said the suspect's mother had reached out to law enforcement last March, warning that her son may attempt ""suicide by cop.""

""The suspect was placed on an immediate detention mental health temporary hold by the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department. A shotgun was seized at his residence. Based on items observed in the suspect's bedroom at that time, he was interviewed by the FBI in April 2020,"" Keenan said. ""No Racially Motivated Violent Extremism (RMVE) ideology was identified during the course of the assessment and no criminal violation was found. The shotgun was not returned to the suspect.""

McCartt said Hole killed four individuals outside and then entered the facility ""for a brief period of time,"" killing four others and then taking his own life.

Four people who suffered gunshot wounds were treated in local hospitals, and a fifth person with an injury that was not firearms-related was also treated, he said.

McCartt said the shooting lasted ""just a few minutes"" and that by the time officers arrived on the scene, it was over.

The FedEx Ground-Plainfield Operation Center warehouse at 8951 Mirabel Road is about five miles from Indianapolis International Airport.

In a statement to NPR, FedEx said it was ""deeply shocked and saddened by the loss of our team members following the tragic shooting at our FedEx Ground facility in Indianapolis.""

""Our most heartfelt sympathies are with all those affected by this senseless act of violence. The safety of our team members is our top priority, and we are fully cooperating with investigating authorities,"" the statement said.

Police said it's unclear how many workers were on duty at the time of the shooting.

A witness said he was working inside the building when he heard a series of rapid gunshots.

""I see a man come out with a rifle in his hand and he starts firing and he starts yellin' stuff that I could not understand,"" Levi Miller told WTHR-TV. ""What I ended up doing was ducking down to make sure he did not see me because I thought he would see me and he would shoot me.""

Jeremiah Miller, who was about to start the second half of a double shift at the FedEx facility when the shooting took place, told WISH-TV that he and a co-worker, Timothy Boillat, heard up to 10 shots.

Miller said he saw a man with what he described as ""a submachine gun of some sort, an automatic rifle.""

Boillat told the TV station that he ""didn't exactly see a person get shot but, after hearing the shooting, I did see a body on the floor behind a vehicle.""

""Luckily, I was far enough away where he (the shooter) didn't notice me or see me. So, thank God for that,"" he said.

The incident is the third mass shooting in Indianapolis this year. Five people were killed in a January shooting, and three adults and a child were killed in an incident in March.

Indianapolis Mayor Joseph Hogsett said the city was ""confronted with the horrific news of yet another mass shooting, an act of violence that senselessly claimed the lives of eight of our neighbors.""

Hogsett, a Democrat, recently signed onto a letter with more than 150 mayors around the country asking the U.S. Senate to take up legislation to expand background checks required when firearms are transferred between private citizens and other gun-related measures.

A Spanish court has provoked outrage by acquitting a man of sexually abusing his 14-year-old stepdaughter despite the fact she gave birth to his child.

The Pamplona court accepted the defendant's claim the teenager initiated the encounter and he had no recollection of it as he had been very drunk that night.

Close to nine months later, in December 2018, the girl was admitted to hospital and gave birth to a child, something the accused claimed had been a complete surprise to him and the girl's mother.

Social services ordered a paternity test, which confirmed the stepfather was the father of the baby.

The girl's mother reported the father for alleged sexual abuse of her daughter, who initially said she had been raped in the street before changing her story to corroborate her stepfather's claim he had not been conscious when they had sex.

The judges, sitting in the same Pamplona court that in 2018 sparked massive protests when acquitting the ""wolf pack"" gang rapists who were later found guilty on appeal, said that there was insufficient evidence to convict the stepfather.

However, the sentence also noted the girl had ""kept her head and eyes facing down"" during the trial, ""answering questions very briefly in a barely audible voice"".

Altamira Gonzalo, vice-president of the Themis women jurists' association, said the verdict ""takes us back to the kind of sentences we used to see in Spain in the 1950s or 60s, when there was complete impunity for men in the family environment"".

""The sentence beggars belief. The only thing the court valued is the accused's right to the presumption of innocence. It has ignored its duty to protect a minor and the fact that the age of consent in Spain is 16,"" Gonzalo told The Telegraph.

Spain's parliament this week passed a new child protection law backed by NGOs such as Save the Children, which estimates only 15 per cent of family abuse cases in Spain are reported.

Cira Garcia, a judge from one of Spain's gender violence courts, said the sentence does not even consider the possibility the girl may have changed her version of events in order to protect her stepfather.

""We are sick of criticising that children's testimony is often not given credibility and they are accused of lying in court, but here the girl's word is accepted without question to absolve the accused, even though her account of events is absolutely implausible,"" Garcia told the online newspaper Publico.

0,The global fight against snake bites,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210413-how-rubber-boots-can-save-people-from-snake-bites,"""Every morning we find the snakes, look at what habitat they are in, whether they are shedding their skin or have just fed,"" he says. ""We are looking at how close they are to where people are working, where they are moving. It is giving us a lot more accurate information that we need to help tell people how to avoid and respect the snakes.""

Involving local people in this research has also been crucial as it is helping to overcome local resistance to the interventions they are attempting to introduce, says Bindumadhav. Farmers, for example, often prefer not to use boots or flashlights when working in the field as they impede their ability to move around or to do work quickly. Similar schemes to hand out boots in Africa have failed because villagers found the boots uncomfortable and as the rubber was valuable, they sold them off, says Albulescu. Boyer too has heard of similar problems.

For farmers like Tukaram Rao, knowing more about the snakes has helped to dispel much of the fear that surrounds them.

""Before this, we used to be very scared of snakes,"" he says. ""We used to run away on seeing a snake or not work in that area at all. Now we have some basic knowledge. For example, when we go to work, we use a stick to check the area before we start working.""

Rao had his own close encounter with a Russell's viper recently while walking from his house to secure his cows. ""I first noticed something shining in the pathway,"" he says. ""I asked my son to fetch a light and we drove it away.""

He hopes that as they learn more about Russell's vipers and their behaviour, it could ultimately allow his community to live alongside the snakes rather than in conflict with them.

""Many people used to kill snakes on sight,"" he says. ""But as we understand them better it could lead to fewer snakes being killed.""

Bindumadhav's ambitions are greater still. He wants to make the entire district around the village free from snake bite deaths. ""We are starting with a village,"" he says. ""But we hope to scale it out to other districts. Snakes are misunderstood creatures – there is no reason anyone has to die from them.""

0,Is China really about to invade Taiwan? | Politics News,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/14/is-there-really-a-risk-that-china-will-go-to-war-with-taiwan,"Analysts say US military’s warnings about rising threat are more a reflection of the deterioration in the US-China relationship rather than any change on the ground.

Taipei, Taiwan – For the first time in more than half a century, the United States and Japan are expected this week to make a joint statement on the security of the Taiwan Strait following a meeting between US President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.

While largely symbolic, the statement would be an indication of increasing concern about the security of the democratically-run island amid dire public warnings from senior US military officials about the threat of an invasion by Beijing, which claims the island as its own.

Admiral John Aquilino recently told a Senate Armed Services committee that taking Taiwan is a “number one” priority for China’s Communist Party, while US Asia Pacific commander Philip Davidson has said publicly that China could invade in the next six years.

Such fears may seem justified by the threatening tone of the Chinese state media and an escalating number of missions by PLA aircraft into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone (ADIZ).

But on the ground in Taiwan, people are neither running for one of the island’s 117,000 working bomb shelters nor enlisting en masse.

Having lived under the threat of Chinese military action for the past 70 years, the island’s 23 million people have come to understand what they consider the strange paradox of Taiwan’s existence: even as China’s military might grows, invasion does not necessarily come any closer.

Some experts believe much of the threat assessment by the US military may actually be more of a reflection of a shift in US perceptions about China amid the deteriorating relationship between the world’s two economic giants.

Taiwan has been modernising its military, including developing new submarines and warships [Ritchie B Tongo/EPA] “The (Chinese Communist Party’s) hopes for unification with Taiwan have been clear for decades, and (President) Xi Jinping has made clear during his term that use of force is on the table,” said Eric Lee, a research associate at the Project 2049 Institute in Arlington, Virginia.

“This challenge is nothing new. Rather, it reflects an updated threat perception of the CCP and PLA in the context of US strategic competition with China.”

Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), agrees.

The assessments, she says, are based not on intelligence but an analysis of the military balance between the US and China.

‘More difficult than D-Day’

China has stepped up its activities around Taiwan since Tsai Ing-wen was first elected president back in 2016.

While Tsai’s politics at home are viewed as largely maintaining the status quo in Taiwan’s complex relationship with China, abroad she is associated with a push for a unique Taiwanese identity that is separate from its historic ties to China.

Her politics and her administration’s close relationship with the US have angered Beijing, which claims Taiwan as its own despite having never ruled the island.

As part of Taiwan’s push for more political space, Tsai has sought to bolster Taiwan’s defences by raising the defence budget, reforming the reserves, improving its image from historical associations with the martial law era, and purchasing billions of dollars in arms from the US since taking office.

President Tsai was first elected in 2016 and has faced an increasingly assertive China, which claims Taiwan as its own [File: Ritchie B Tongo/EPA] Her administration has also seen a push to revive Taiwan’s domestic weapons manufacturing, including locally-made submarines, armoured vehicles, and military aircraft, according to the Ministry of Defense.

“The CCP has not given up on the use of force to invade Taiwan, and the Chinese military has continued to strengthen its combat readiness, and readiness to increase the CCP’s use of force,” the ministry said in a statement to Al Jazeera.

“There is always a risk of seizing Taiwan. Whether it is a sudden attack… or a full-scale invasion, it will seriously impact the country’s survival and development. Therefore, supporting the defense operations of various military building and preparation work is the core task of the national army.”

In late March, the Ministry of Defense said incursions into Taiwan’s ADIZ had become so frequent that it would no longer scramble to meet the aircraft each time and would instead track them with missiles. The Ministry said the decision was made on the assessment that the flights were consuming resources and increasing the risk of a miscalculation or accident.

And while some, particularly in the US, have begun to speculate that an amphibious invasion by the PLA is somewhere on the horizon, most experts take a more measured approach, stressing that an invasion of Taiwan carries significant risks for China.

First, its forces would have to cross the 180km (100-mile) Taiwan Strait with more than 100,000 soldiers and supplies, according to Michael Tsai, who served as Taiwan’s vice minister of defence and then minister of defence between 2004 and 2008.

En route, they would face aerial and naval bombardment and, if they managed to land, strong local resistance.

“If Taiwan was attacked by the PLA, more than two-thirds of young people would take affirmative action to resist Chinese action,” the former defence minister said. “Taiwan is a free and democratic country. We like to live in a peaceful coexistence with China but if we were attacked we have to react for some defences. Of course, will suffer a lot. Many young people will lose their life, but so will the PLA.”

For Taiwan expert and historian Bill Sharp, a former visiting scholar at National Taiwan University, such a manoeuvre would be “more difficult than a D-Day Landing” due to Taiwan’s geography, rough waters, and unreliable weather patterns. Its coastline also offers few suitable beaches, he said, for landing “armoured personnel carriers, tanks, artillery, or large numbers of invading troops.”

A missile attack, meanwhile, would lead to a far great of a loss of human life and destruction of infrastructure and would fuel opposition to any invading force.

“China would prefer to rule Taiwan as it physically is,” he said. “With their society violently attacked, Taiwanese will to fight will be piqued.”

Unknown ‘unknowns’

An invasion could also draw in Taiwan’s closest allies, such as the United States and Japan, posing too many unknowns for China’s leadership.

While the US is not guaranteed to come to the island’s defence, it has promised to help the island maintain “sufficient self-defence capabilities” as part of the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act.

CSIS’s Glaser says she does not believe China is yet ready to take such drastic action.

“Every Chinese leader has said reunification is inevitable,” she said. “Xi Jinping’s pronouncements on Taiwan aren’t very different from his predecessors,” she said, adding that China’s latest Five-Year-Plan called for the “peaceful development of Cross-Strait relations” with Taiwan.

Some experts believe much of the threat assessment by the US military may actually reflect a domestic shift within the US in perceptions of China. As China’s relationship with the US has soured, the threat perception of the PLA has also risen, said Project 2049’s Lee.

Mechanics repair F-CK-1 Ching-kuo Indigenous Defence Fighters at an air force base in Tainan in January. The island has stopped scrambling for every Chinese incursion, instead tracking the aircraft with missiles [File: Ann Wang/Reuters] Others also warn that the US’s concern is less for the future of the people of Taiwan than reflective of anxiety about its Island Chain Strategy, a defensive strategy incorporating Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines and other islands to contain China’s expansion into the Pacific and close to the US mainland.

“The US knows that if China took the dominant position in the Asia-Pacific, it would have a detrimental effect against US national interests, so the US will try to defend the ‘first island chain’. Taiwan is in a strategic position as part of the first island chain. If Taiwan lost to China, it could become a PLA naval base that would threaten not only Japan but also US national security interests,” former defence minister Tsai said.

However, experts say Taiwan’s outlying islands could still be targeted.

“To seize Taiwan’s outer islands has always been on PLA’s practice agenda. If you take a look at geography, Taiwan’s outer islands are spread out, the ability to support one another is limited,” said James Huang, a retired Taiwanese lieutenant colonel turned military columnist.

China could easily blockade Taiwan’s port in Kaohsiung by taking its 240-hectare (593-acre) Pratas Island off the coast of Hong Kong or strengthen its position in the South China Sea by invading Taiping Island – also known as Ita Abu – in the Spratly Archipelago.

Huang said other relatively easy targets would include islands close to the Chinese coast including Liang Island and Gaodeng Island, which have few military personnel and are difficult to resupply by Taiwan’s main island.

Psychological warfare

Even if Taiwan may not face its doomsday scenario in the near future, it still faces a range of other challenges.

“Taiwan is no longer China’s main target, but the US is,” Huang said. “In terms of the biggest threat to Taiwan from China, it definitely is not the traditional military invasion.”

He believes Beijing’s focus is crippling Taiwan through economics and trade.

Faced with a weak economy and a strong neighbour next door, during non-COVID times, Taiwan faces a significant brain drain to China with hundreds of thousands opting for more competitive opportunities there.

“By increasing Taiwan’s economic dependence on China, it’s like the boiling frog syndrome, Taiwanese people will let their guard down,” he said.

As well as the regular airspace incursions, Taiwan has also been subject to psychological warfare from Chinese influence operations in the business and political world, and the continual push to squeeze Taiwan out of any international space, from the United Nations to the International Civil Aviation Organisation.

Former US Senator Chris Dodd, former US Deputy Secretary of State Jim Steinberg and former US Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage walk with Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu and American Institute in Taiwan Director Brent Christensen as they arrive in Taipei on Wednesday [Central News Agency/Pool via Reuters] Though less-headline grabbing than a flotilla of PLA aircraft carriers, it could still have a powerful impact, warns Tsai.

“To me and many strategists, we sense that China knows that taking actual military action would be the worst scenario for them as well,” he said. “Therefore, they are taking softer power action, including cyber warfare, psychological warfare, media warfare by penetrating Taiwan and getting disinformation into the newspaper to try to influence and mislead the population and also try to divide them.”

Glaser says rather than fixating on the potential for a Chinese invasion, the US would do better to support Taiwan against many of these other threats.

“The correct policy response by the US is not only to bolster military deterrence – we must make credible our ability to intervene and impose high costs on a PLA invading force – but we must also strengthen the US-Taiwan economic relationship, help Taiwan diversify its trade ties, and knit together a coalition of countries that will promote Taiwan’s participation in the international community and speak out in support of its democracy,” she said.

There are already signs that might be happening.

On Wednesday, as China conducted what it said were “combat drills” near Taiwan, Biden dispatched a delegation of trusted former senior officials to Taiwan. They will meet President Tsai on Thursday.

A statement with Japan will be another part of that process.",1979,12411,10,55

1,New Military Diversity Initiative Aims To Make Leadership Look More Like Countries They Invade,https://www.theonion.com/new-military-diversity-initiative-aims-to-make-leadersh-1846391375,"WASHINGTON—In a move that officials from the Pentagon called long overdue, a new U.S. military diversity initiative unveiled Wednesday aimed to make leadership look more like the countries they invade. “It’s the 21st century, and it simply isn’t right to have a group of generals leading the United States Armed Forces who don’t resemble the populations of the nations we bomb into oblivion,” said Gen. Mark Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who added that while the military had made strides in recent years, proportional representation of women and people of color among leadership remained just a fraction of the diversity represented in countries like Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, and Somalia. “In country after country we invade, we see that there’s a diversity that’s lacking among our top leaders, and this initiative will take steps to change that imbalance. We need more Muslims, more folks of Arabic descent, not only African Americans but Africans too. We don’t have children represented at all at the top levels of Pentagon leadership. When the U.S. is ignoring every tenet of international law to pursue its own financially driven objectives in your country, whether you’re a victim of a drone strike, had your government overthrown, or just live in the daily terror of violence, you should be able to point to one of the people doing that to you and say, ‘That person looks like me.’” U.S. military officials announced that their first phase would involve armed recruitment of potential candidates representing the backgrounds of countries they invade, and they were prepared to integrate them into leadership by force.

There is growing international concern for jailed Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny, as his team warned he is now dangerously ill and could die within ""a matter of days.""

Navalny’s allies are calling for mass protests next week, saying if the Kremlin is not forced to give Navalny medical care, he will die.

Navalny, known as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest critic, is 19 days into a hunger strike in prison, where he was sentenced after returning to Russia having survived a nerve agent poisoning last year.

He declared the hunger strike to protest the prison’s refusal to provide him with medical treatment for severe back pain caused by two suspected hernias, but in recent days, his team has said his health has deteriorated fast.

In a message calling for the protests, his team said Navalny’s life is now “hanging by a hair” and accused the Kremlin of “killing Navalny for a second time before the eyes of all Russia.""

Since Friday, his team has been sounding the alarm that Navalny’s health is rapidly declining and warning that the threat to his life is now as serious as when he was poisoned last August.

“Events are developing too quickly and too badly. The life of Alexey Navalny and the fate of Russia depends on how many citizens come out to the streets this Wednesday,” Navalny’s team said in a statement on its website.

Doctors helping Navalny’s family said on Saturday blood tests showed his potassium levels are “catastrophically” high, meaning that he could suffer heart failure at ""any moment."" One of the doctors, Yaroslav Ashikhmin, said the tests also suggested that Navalny’s kidneys are now shutting down.

In such a condition, Ashikhmin wrote on Facebook, a patient would normally be moved to an intensive care unit.

""People usually avoid using the word 'dying,'"" Navalny’s spokesperson Kira Yarmysh wrote on Facebook Saturday. “Me personally because I don’t like throwing such big statements around. But right now Alexey is dying. In his state, it is a matter of days.”

Yarmysh and other members of Navalny’s team said they now fear that the Kremlin has decided to put an end to the challenge posed by him, by allowing him to die out of sight in the prison camp. Navalny's doctors again sought to visit him Sunday but said they were denied entry.

On Friday, Russian prosecutors moved to have Navalny’s key organizations declared ""extremist groups,"" which would outlaw his movement and put anyone supporting him at risk of lengthy prison sentences. The request to ban the groups -- the Anti-Corruption Foundation and Navalny’s regional campaign headquarters -- is the most serious attempt yet to destroy Navalny's movement.

The European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on Sunday issued a statement expressing “deep concern” about Navalny’s condition and demanding that the Kremlin grant immediate medical access to him. The bloc’s foreign ministers will discuss the situation at a meeting on Monday, it said in a statement.

The U.S. State Department also called for Russia to immediately give Navalny access to medical care.

""Russian authorities are responsible for Aleksey Navalny's well-being, and we call on them to allow him access to necessary medical care immediately in response to disturbing reports his health is deteriorating,"" the department's spokesperson Ned Price wrote on Twitter.

Before Navalny fell ill, his allies had planned to hold a mass protest this spring once 500,000 people registered on a website saying they were ready to take part. But on Sunday, Navalny’s team said they could no longer wait given how critical the situation was.

The team called for protests in the central squares of every Russian city at 7 p.m. local time, coinciding with the same day that Putin is due to give an annual state-of-the-nation address.

In January, the Kremlin was able to shut down protests that broke out after Navalny returned to Russia and was jailed on parole violations that have been widely condemned as politically motivated. After police detained thousands during the protests, Navalny’s team was forced to call for further demonstrations. The plan to gather 500,000 online registrations was intended to ensure protests were large enough to have an impact, but Navalny’s decline has upended that plan.

Observers in Moscow said they feared that Russia having weathered the protests in January and only having received symbolic sanctions from Western countries over Navalny’s jailing, the Kremlin may have concluded it can now allow him to die.

""The danger is that the collective Kremlin may have decided to end the Navalny problem once and for all: he may die in detention, and his infrastructure will be destroyed. Protests? They can be suppressed and will go into decline,” Andrei Kolesnikov, an analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Center, wrote on Twitter.

Navalny's team said said next week's protests have become a final showdown with the Kremlin to stop Navalny's death and prevent the complete destruction of a democratic opposition in Russia.

""if we are silent now then the darkest time will come for free people,"" Leonid Volkov and Ivan Zhdanov, two top Navalny aides, said in a video posted Sunday. ""Russia will sink into total darkness.""",868,5307,12,81

(AP Photo/Andy Wong, File)

China said Friday it has expressed “serious concerns” to the United States and Japan over what it calls negative moves and collusion between the two countries against China.

The statement from Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian came just before President Joe Biden welcomed Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to the White House on Friday in his first face-to-face meeting with a foreign leader.

That meeting is seen as reflecting Biden’s emphasis on strengthening alliances to deal with a more assertive China and other global challenges.

Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing that Japan and the United States should “take China’s concerns and demands seriously, avoid words and actions that interfere in China’s internal affairs and harm China’s interests.”

“China has no objection to the development of normal bilateral relations between Japan and the United States, but such relations should help enhance mutual understanding and trust among regional countries and contribute to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, and should not target or harm the interests of third parties,"" Zhao said.

China would “make necessary responses as appropriate,"" he said.

Biden and Suga see their meeting as a chance to counter messaging from Chinese President Xi Jinping that America and democracies in general are on the decline, after the political turmoil and backing away from global leadership that marked Donald Trump’s presidency.

Japan remains China's traditional rival dating from Tokyo's brutal WWII occupation of much of the country. Relations between Washington and Beijing are tenser than ever over trade, technology, Hong Kong, Taiwan and human rights, particularly China's policies toward Turkic Muslims in the northwestern region of Xinjiang.

U.S. and Chinese naval movements in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea, which China claims virtually in its entirety, have added to tensions in recent days, following statements from U.S. officials that Beijing may be accelerating its schedule to annex Taiwan by force.

The Biden administration says the primary challenge for the United States lies in managing U.S. policies toward the Indo-Pacific, the main theater in which China is flexing its growing economic and military power. That helped guide Biden’s decision, announced this week, to pull U.S. troops out of Afghanistan and free the administration to focus more on East Asia.

0,Raúl Castro confirms he is resigning as head of Cuba’s Communist party,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/16/raul-castro-cuba-communist-party-resigning,"Raúl Castro has confirmed that he is resigning as head of Cuba’s Communist party, ending an era of formal leadership by him and his brother Fidel Castro that began with the 1959 revolution.

The 89-year-old Castro made the announcement on Friday in a speech at the opening of the eighth congress of the ruling party – the only one allowed on the island.

“I believe fervently in the strength and exemplary nature and comprehension of my compatriots, and as long as I live I will be ready with my foot in the stirrups to defend the fatherland, the revolution and socialism,” Castro told hundreds of party delegates gathered at a convention center in Havana.

He said he was retiring with the sense of having “fulfilled his mission and confident in the future of the fatherland”.

Castro did not say who he would endorse as his successor as first secretary of the Communist party. But he previously indicated that he favors yielding control to 60-year-old Miguel Díaz-Canel, who succeeded him as president in 2018 and is the standard bearer of a younger generation of loyalists who have been pushing an economic opening without touching Cuba’s one-party system.

His retirement means that for the first time in more than six decades, Cubans will not have a Castro formally guiding their affairs, and it comes at a difficult time, with many on the island anxious about what lies ahead.

The coronavirus pandemic, painful financial reforms and restrictions imposed by the Trump administration have battered the economy, which shrank 11% last year as a result of a collapse in tourism and remittances. Long food lines and shortages have brought back echoes of the “special period” that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s.

Discontent has been fueled by the spread of the internet and growing inequality.

Much of the debate inside Cuba is focused on the pace of reform, with many complaining that the so-called “historic generation” represented by Castro has been too slow to open the economy.

In January, Diaz-Canel finally pulled the trigger on a plan approved two congresses ago to unify the island’s dual currency system, giving rise to fears of inflation. He also threw the doors open to a broader range of private enterprise – a category long banned or tightly restricted – permitting Cubans to legally operate many sorts of self-run businesses from their homes.

This year’s congress is expected to focus on unfinished reforms to overhaul state-run enterprises, attract foreign investment and provide more legal protection to private business activities.

The Communist party is made up of 700,000 activists and is tasked in Cuba’s constitution with directing the affairs of the nation and society.

Fidel Castro, who led the revolution that drove dictator Fulgencio Batista from power in 1959, formally became head of the party in 1965, about four years after officially embracing socialism.

He quickly absorbed the old party under his control and was the country’s unquestioned leader until falling ill in 2006 and in 2008 handing over the presidency to his younger brother Raúl, who had fought alongside him during the revolution.

Brazil asked women on Friday to delay getting pregnant until the worst of the pandemic passes, saying the virus variant that is devastating the South American country appears to affect expectant mothers more than earlier versions of the coronavirus.

The recommendation comes as Brazil continues to be one of the global epicenters of the pandemic, with more Brazilians dying of the virus each day than anywhere else in the world.

Hospitals are buckling under the strain and stocks of drugs needed for intubating severely ill patients are running perilously low, with Brazil turning to international partners for help with emergency supplies.

""If it’s possible, delay pregnancy a little until a better moment,"" Health Ministry official Raphael Parente said during a news conference on Friday.

He said the recommendation was partly due to the stress on the health system but also due to the more easily transmissible Brazilian variant known as P.1.

""The clinical experience of specialists shows that this new variant acts more aggressively in pregnant women,"" Parente said.

Previously, COVID-19 cases during pregnancy were focused on the final trimester and birth, whereas lately there have been more serious cases in the second and occasionally first trimester, he said.

Parente did not give any more details.

The P.1 variant, first discovered in the Amazon city of Manaus, has quickly become dominant in Brazil. It is thought to be a major factor behind a massive second wave of infections that has brought the country's death toll to over 350,000 - the second highest in the world behind the United States.

Brazil's outbreak is increasingly affecting younger people, with hospital data showing that in March more than half of all patients in intensive care were aged 40 or younger. read more

President Jair Bolsonaro has opposed lockdowns and held large events in which he often does not wear a mask. He has only recently embraced vaccines as a possible solution, but the inoculation rollout has been plagued by delays and missed targets for getting people inoculated.

This week, vaccinations were stopped in several cities due to a shortage of vaccine supply, according to local media.

The surge in COID-19 cases has also left hospitals short of sedatives needed for patients who require mechanical ventilation.

An emergency shipment of the drugs arrived in Brazil late on Thursday from China, while donations from Spain are expected to arrive next week.

Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo have both sounded the alarm over shortages, with Sao Paulo's health secretary saying this week that the city's ability to care for seriously ill COVID-19 patients is on the verge of collapse.

Despite the shortage of drugs and 85% of intensive care beds occupied, Sao Paulo announced on Friday it would begin reopening stores and restaurants, saying the number of new hospitalizations had fallen sufficiently to do so safely.

1,"Hey Gamers, Our Source Inside Nintendo Disappeared And We Just Received His Gaming Hand In A Box So Don’t Expect Any News For A While",https://ogn.theonion.com/hey-gamers-our-source-inside-nintendo-disappeared-and-1846460476,"Readers, for decades you’ve come to OGN for the latest news and inside scoops about Nintendo. Unfortunately, today we received an indication that our reporting about the legendary console maker and developer may need to be put on hold. You see, our undercover source at the company disappeared last week, and we’ve just received a box with his severed gaming hand inside. The sad takeaway here is you shouldn’t expect any leaks from us about Nintendo for the foreseeable future.

Our first suspicion that something had gone awry came last week, when our source—long known for his punctuality—missed a scheduled weekly check-in with us. We had been waiting on some big news about the upcoming Nintendo direct, but the time came and went without a peep.



Of course, our intial instinct was to keep calm. He had cancelled drops before, such as when he was in deep cover at Intelligent Systems to blow the lid off the development of Paper Mario: The Origami King. But when he failed to respond on his distress frequency or the coded message on his burner phone, we feared the worst.



Then this morning came. We were delivered a mysterious white box tied with a red ribbon, which contained his hand clutching a Wii U controller with no note or message attached. You don’t need to be a genius to read between the lines and know there won’t be any Breath Of The Wild 2 news from us anytime soon.

Obviously, this is a huge blow to us because our mole has been one of the best sources of Nintendo information for the past decade. Most notably, he escaped a team of President Satoru Iwata’s deadly fixers to deliver us an untested beta of Pikmin 3. If you ever wondered how we managed to confirm the existence of rock Pikmin way back in 2008, now you know: It is a testament to his dedication and cunning that this vital information ever leaked to the public at all. Now, looking at this severed hand, we understand that the release of Mario Golf: Super Rush could come and go without us being able to report on potential DLC characters.



Needless to say, it’s a hard pill to swallow.

Clearly, our informant’s fate is sealed. Anyone familiar with Nintendo’s tactics know they are notoriously cruel towards leakers, with untold legions being poisoned, drowned, or bludgeoned to death by during the past reign of the lunatic Reggie Fils-Aimé. Thankfully, our informant did have a cyanide capsule embedded in his molar, so the best we can hope for is that he died peacefully by his own hand.

Still, we will not let this man’s brave sacrifice be in vain. It is our sacred duty to inform you of upcoming Yoshi and Star Fox games, and this setback will not deter us. This individual was only one of our assets within Nintendo. We can strike at them in any department, at any time. If it is a war Nintendo wants, then it is a war Nintendo will get.",509,2874,25,133

Now you just sit there and think long and hard about whether that’s really the best candidate for our country.” At press time, Nagle had beaten the man unconscious after he was unable to immediately produce a voter ID.

For far too long I've sat idly by, twiddling my thumbs and respecting the right of others to form thoughts and opinions independent of my own, and I can't take it anymore. I've got to speak up about the many things that annoy me or I'm going to go crazy. Take these new credit cards with the microchips in them, for instance. Man, those things really get my goat—trying to improve a device that was working perfectly fine as it was. Even worse are those wrappers on CDs that take forever to open. But you know what I hate the most? The one thing that makes my blood boil whenever I see it? Anything beyond my mental capacity, that's what.

God, all the people, places, and things I haven't made the least bit of effort to comprehend should just die already.

Will you look at all this stuff I have neither the intellect nor the maturity level to process? What a load of crap. It's in my face every day, doing lots of things I don't have an immediate desire to do and saying things I can't identify with at this stage in my life. How lame is that? I mean, what kind of pathetic loser would actually enjoy something that's so incredibly not among my personal preferences? Not me, that's for sure.

Maybe my standards are too high, but if you like any of the hundreds upon hundreds of things that are too multifaceted for my attention span, you should have your head examined, weirdo.

And don't even get me started on complex and sophisticated notions I can't possibly wrap my head around. That stuff makes me want to puke. Just knowing there are people out there who like—actually like—interacting with concepts that overwhelm my feeble consciousness makes me embarrassed to be an American. I don't like it in our homes, I don't like it in our schools, I don't like it outside of my comfort zone—well, I just plain don't like it. And if that makes me closed-minded, well, then I guess I'll have to dismiss that accusation outright in order to avoid being introspective even for a moment.

Why, only yesterday I saw a commercial on TV for a new product I have no immediate use for and therefore cannot see any value in. Who's making this worthless junk? Seriously. If I see one more household appliance I am not mature enough to own or operate, I'm going to punch someone. I swear. Sell that to the suckers with the money and inclination to buy it, because I wouldn't take it off your hands if you gave it to me, provided me with a living situation stable enough to house it, and showed me how to use it in a manner that didn't disrupt any of my cripplingly sedentary lifestyle habits.

Same goes with any TV show, movie, band, solo act, artist, book, burgeoning subculture, celebrity, fashion trend, or religious belief that makes me feel excluded from my peers or otherwise ostracized by the mainstream. That stuff is retarded.

While I'm at it, I'm sick to death of this growing trend of people who don't share my cultural heritage. I don't know how you did things back in that country I never took the time to educate myself about, but around here, we dip our fries in ketchup. That's the way it's always been as far as I know, and that's the way it's going to be until such time as I choose to acknowledge diversity among the earth's 6.6 billion people.

If things don't start changing around here, I might have to up and leave this town. It's gotten to the point where I can't walk down the street without having some flier thrust into my face, advertising some dumb concert or stupid party or annoying art festival or lame-o Minnesota primary or any number of other events that no sane person with a crippling fear of the unknown and a wildly underdeveloped imagination would ever want to go to. I've never been to any of these social gatherings, but I imagine the scores of people who attend them must be total idiots.

New York prosecutors say the properties in Mexico were bought by Caro Quintero, the head of a faction of the notorious Sinaloa cartel, with money obtained from drug trafficking.

“The United States will seek to enforce this order through diplomatic channels,” the Eastern District of New York said in a statement following Judge Eric Vitaliano’s ruling.

Caro Quintero is on the list of the FBI’s 10 most wanted fugitives, with a $20 million bounty on his head.

The United States accuses him of ordering the kidnap, torture, and murder of Drug Enforcement Agency special agent Enrique “Kiki” Camarena in 1985.

Caro Quintero was arrested that year, tried in Mexico, and sentenced to 40 years in prison, but in 2013, a judge released him on a legal technicality and he went into hiding.

0,US rejects Slovenia-linked EU plan to break up Bosnia [as a followup to Yugoslavia's break-up],https://euobserver.com/world/151572,"The US has said it is against the break-up of Bosnia, following a radical proposal widely attributed to incoming EU presidency Slovenia.

""The United States deeply values its longstanding partnership with Bosnia and Herzegovina. We support its sovereignty and territorial integrity, respect for which was enshrined in the Dayton Peace Accords,"" a state department spokesperson said on Thursday (15 April), referring to a 1995 peace deal which ended a bloody ethnic conflict.

Student or retired? Then this plan is for you.

The Croatian foreign minister, Grlić Radman, said the same one day earlier.

The comments arose after an informal policy paper, which came to light earlier this week, proposed an EU-led campaign to carve up the federation.

Its majority-ethnic Serb parts should join Serbia, its Croatian parts should join Croatia, and its rump would become an independent state for Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims), the policy paper said.

Kosovo should also join with Albania to create another new country, the paper, which was sent to EU Council president Charles Michel in February, added.

There is little doubt in diplomatic circles that Slovenia's populist prime minister, Janez Janša, who takes over the symbolic EU presidency in July, was behind it.

This is what Bosnia believes, after it summoned Slovenia's ambassador to Sarajevo to complain earlier this week.

This is what US diplomats believe, speaking off the record.

And this is what EU diplomats told Slovenian daily

Necenzurirano.si, which published the informal paper in its entirety.

But for his part, the usually pugnacious Janša is keeping quiet - neither conforming nor denying the reports - amid the negative reactions.

In the past, he called two women journalists he did not like ""worn-out prostitutes"" in an infamous tweet.

In late March, he also called two MEPs he did not like ""overpaid bureaucrats who were born into prosperity"" and likened them to the late Serbian dictator Slobodan Milošević.

But when asked by EUobserver if he sent the paper to Brussels, his staff replied: ""The office of the prime minister of the Republic of Slovenia does not further comment the topic on the so-called 'non-paper' document about the Western Balkans"".

His EU embassy also declined to comment.

But with Brussels bracing itself for six months of potential controversy under Janša's presidency, a Slovenian spokesman tried to calm tension.

Redrawing borders on ethnic lines in the Western Balkans is widely seen as a recipe for renewed instability.

But the Slovenian spokesman said: ""I can tell you that one of the main themes [of the presidency] will be a secure European Union, a good and reliable partner in the neighbourhood and in the world"".

""The Slovenian presidency will dedicate particular attention to the Western Balkans and lead the Council of the EU in the direction of continuing the process of EU enlargement with the countries of the region,"" he added.",471,2945,15,94

It is an everyday morning routine for young brothers - who we're calling Aung Lin and Kyaw Lin - to look towards the mountain and remember their friends and family after they were smuggled out a fortnight ago.

“Mummy, we really miss you and our friends and want you to come back now,” said younger brother Aung Lin, 13, on the phone to her mother in Myanmar.

“The situation is very volatile in our town and the army is continually raiding houses. So don’t think of even coming soon,” said the weeping mother on the other side of the phone.

Both brothers were studying in the local school of a small Myanmar town and were living with a family of six after the death of their father.

After their father died, their mother began working hard in their fields to ensure a proper education for her sons.

But it all changed with the military coup in Myanmar.

After the coup, the Junta started facing massive civilian protests all across the country and at many places policemen revolted and ran away to India, leaving behind their jobs and families.

Most of these policemen were not willing to shoot the pro-democracy supporters and have joined a civil disobedience movement called by ousted leader Aung Sang Suu Kyi.

Faced with its depleting ranks in armed forces, the Myanmar army started recruiting young children.

“They began searching for young boys in the day time and they would come in the night to pick them up for forcible recruitment in the army,” said older brother Kyaw Lin, 15.

“They searched for us as well. So me and my friends ran away from there and have taken shelter in India.”

Many families are hiding on the Indian side to avoid the daily violence and the army’s brutality in Myanmar.

One refugee from Myanmar, currently staying in India, told ITV News that children are running away from the country because the army is using its muscle power to recruit them. So boys aged 12-15 are running away from their homes and hiding in other countries and in jungles.

ITV News met scores of young children who are currently staying in India to avoid being forced into joining the Army.

“My parents are worried for us and didn’t want us to work in the army so they shifted us to India. Most of my friends have also shifted to India. We can’t go back to Myanmar, the situation is very bad so we are still hiding in India,” said the 18-year-old who didn’t want to named.

Myanmar is thought to have up to 50,000 children serving for its armed forces, one of the largest numbers of underage soldiers in the world.

The Coalition Against Terrorism and Extremism (CATE) has warned France that its sabotage and sponsorship of Boko Haram/ISWAP activities in Nigeria poses a threat to the country’s sovereignty.

CATE made this known in an open letter signed by its National Co-ordinator, Gabriel Onoja, on Monday and addressed to France Ambassador to Nigeria, Jérôme Pasquier.

Also read:

According to Onoja, the European nation alongside its former colonies are frustrating Nigeria’s counter-terrorism efforts over the crude oil and mineral deposits found in the Lake Chad Basin.

“We decided to pen down this open epistle to you and by implication, the French Government to express our deep concerns over some suspected developments, actions or inactions by the government of your country in the festering Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) terrorism in Nigeria, particularly in the Northeast region,” Onoja wrote on behalf of CATE.

“We dare submit that wittingly, Nigeria’s war against terrorism is greatly hampered for lack of adequate cooperation or outright sabotage of its efforts by her neighbouring countries, the former colonies of France.

” The game plan is to keep the Lake Chad Basin area permanently unsecured for Nigeria to be unable to embark on crude oil prospecting on its own side of the Lake Chad and legitimate boundaries; while the same resources are illegally or stealthily tapped by partners in this criminal cartel.”

CATE said it is disappointed with France’s “lukewarm posture” to terrorist activities, adding that the country’s silence is a sign of guilt.

The group recalled how the French failed alliance with its ex-colonies almost jeopardized Nigeria’s progress and the European nation’s failure to prosecute eight of its nationals fighting on the side of Boko Haram since 2017.

“In 2017, France organized a security summit to discuss Boko Haram. And months later, it launched the G5 Sahel Force at a conference with French President Emmanuel Marcon in attendance together with leaders of Niger, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Burkina Faso. Shortly after the French Summit on Boko Haram, remnants of the sect which escaped from Nigeria into Niger and Chad bounced back stronger to launch attacks on Nigeria,” Onoja stated.

“There were strong indications that the Nigerian Military decimated Boko Haram to near defeat in 2017. But curiously, the sect resurged suddenly after the formation of G5 Sahel Force, and with attacks from their safe havens in France’s former colonies, but not a whisper was heard from the French Government as a reprimand.

“Strangely too, Nigeria’s militia fighting Boko Haram is known as the Civilian JTF, Internally Displaced Persons and several survivors of Boko Haram attacks admitted through eyewitnesses narratives the airdrop of supplies to the terrorists across Nigeria’s borders with her francophone neighbours of Cameroon, Chad and Niger, a violation of the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy stipulations endorsed by all member-states.

“Several security experts and analysts, as well as intelligence reports, have fingered Chad and Niger as offering transit routes through their countries’ borders for the movement of a large cache of arms and ammunition to Boko Haram insurgents. It is the weapons supplies that embolden Boko Haram atrocities in Nigeria, but France is suspiciously silent over the development by her former colonies.

“CATE is also concerned that the French Government refused to prosecute eight French nationals fighting on the side of Boko Haram and were ‘mistakenly’ arrested by Cameroonian forces in 2015.‎ The serving French Foreign Minister at that time, Mr. Lauren Fabuci ordered Cameroun to transfer the suspects to France for presumed prosecution. But thereafter, the suspects are not known to have been subjected to any trial by the French Government in contravention of international laws on counter-terrorism.”

“In the face of these consistent worthy allegations in the public domain, the silence of France is not golden or possibly, an acquiesce of guilt. Therefore, we write to seek explanations to these allegations on France’s alleged complicity in sponsoring terrorism in Nigeria. The silence of France is the reason experts are holding strongly to the verdict that France is behind Boko Haram terrorism in Nigeria. ”

CATE, however, warned France to quit the silence and genuinely support Nigeria to flush out of Boko Haram remnants for the “utmost benefits to citizens of both countries who share a very close affinity that dates back to centuries to decisively work together to defeat Boko Haram terrorists”.

Courtesy of Dawei Watch/via REUTERS

Myanmar security forces on Thursday arrested one of the main leaders of the campaign against military rule after ramming him with a car as he led a motorbike protest rally, friends and colleagues said.

Opponents of the Feb. 1 coup that ousted an elected government led by Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi have kept up their campaign against the military this traditional New Year week with marches and various other shows of defiance.

""Our brother Wai Moe Naing was arrested. His motorbike was hit by an unmarked police car,"" Win Zaw Khiang, a member of a protest organising group, said on social media.

Wai Moe Naing, a 25-year-old Muslim, has emerged as one of the most high-profile leaders of opposition to the coup.

Earlier, Reuters spoke to him by telephone as he was setting off to lead the rally in the central town of Monywa, about 700 km (435 miles) north of the main city of Yangon.

Video posted on social media showed an oncoming car swerving into a group of motorbikes.

A spokesman for the junta could not be reached for comment.

Monywa has been one of main centres of the pro-democracy campaign with big rallies day after day and repeated crackdowns by the security forces.

Some colleagues said they feared for Wai Moe Naing's safety.

The Swedish embassy said it was following his case and urged that all detainees be allowed proper health care and their human rights be respected.

The U.S. Embassy also condemned the reported incident.

""This appalling act further demonstrates why the people of Myanmar do not accept the military regime,"" the embassy said in a post on Twitter.

PROTESTING MEDICS

In Yangon, security forces detained Myo Aye, director of the Solidarity Trade Union of Myanmar, activist Ei Thinzar Maung said on Facebook. Myo Aye has also played a major role in organising the protests.

State media said a famous actor, Zin Wine, and singer Po Po, both known for their support of the democracy movement, had also been arrested.

The coup has plunged Myanmar into crisis after 10 years of tentative steps toward democracy, with, in addition to the daily protests, strikes by workers in many sectors that have brought the economy to a standstill.

An activist group, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, says the security forces have killed 715 protesters since the overthrow of Suu Kyi's government.

Earlier on Thursday, soldiers opened fire in the city of Mandalay to disperse protesting medical workers and one man was killed and several wounded when security forces fired in a nearby neighbourhood, media reported.

Some medical workers have been at the forefront of the campaign against the coup, which for many people has dashed hopes of a more open society after tentative steps towards democracy since the military initiated reforms a decade ago.

State television announced that 20 doctors were among 40 people wanted under a law that makes it illegal to encourage mutiny or dereliction of duty in the security forces. Some 200 people are now wanted under the charge.

The military says the protests are dwindling but thousands joined protests marches and motorbike rallies in several towns, according to pictures posted by media outlets.

The United States and other Western countries have imposed limited sanctions focused on the military and called for the release of Suu Kyi and others detained by the new authorities.

Leaders of Southeast Asian neighbours, which have been trying to encourage talks between the rival Myanmar sides, are due to met in Indonesia on April 24 to discuss the situation, Thai PBS World reported.

Junta leader Senior General Min Aung Hlaing is due to attend, the broadcaster said, on what would be his first known trip abroad and contact with foreign leaders since he seized power.

The 5,800sq km (2,239sq miles) ice block known as A68a broke off from the Antarctic peninsula's Larsen C ice shelf in July 2017.

But satellite images now show the iceberg has broken up into tiny pieces, which are too small to track any further, the US National Ice Center said.

The iceberg spent two years not moving far before it became caught in a powerful current that propelled it northeast.

The structure drew attention in December last year when it looked like it might hit the island of South Georgia, while travelling through the Southern Antarctic Front.

There were concerns it would threaten the island's diverse wildlife if it impacted.

An RAF reconnaissance aircraft was drafted to capture images of A68a in a bid to predict where it might travel.

By this point A68a measured 4,200sq km (1,622sq miles) but it has shrunk further this year, with multiple icebergs calving from it since January.

0,Sputnik V: How Russia's COVID vaccine is dividing Europe,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-56735931,"Sputnik V: How Russia's Covid vaccine is dividing Europe By Kevin Connolly

BBC News, Brussels Published 2 days ago

image copyright EPA image caption Several European countries have shown interest in Sputnik although the EU's medicines agency is yet to approve it

It's no coincidence that Russia has christened its Covid vaccine Sputnik V. The first time the world learned the meaning of the Russian word Sputnik was in 1957 when the Soviet Union launched the first man-made satellite into orbit.

At the height of the Cold War this startling evidence of Moscow's scientific and technical capabilities came as a huge shock to Western powers, which had assumed they enjoyed a comfortable technological lead over the Soviets.

Critics of the Putin administration were sceptical when the vaccine was given regulatory approval in Moscow as early as last August.

That scepticism, though, has faded. Because once again Russian scientists have surprised the West.

A Russian 'tool of soft power'

An Eastern European diplomat, from a country that regards Russia as a clear and present threat, put it to me like this: ""The search for vaccines in 2020 was rather similar to the race for space flight in the 1950s. Once again many outsiders have underestimated Russia. This is potentially the most powerful tool of soft power that Moscow has had in its hands for generations.""

That word ""potentially"" is important here.

Sputnik V has not yet been approved by the EU's European Medicines Agency. But it's already been ordered by many different countries from Argentina and Mexico to Israel and the Philippines, and Russian officials say they have signed deals to produce it in South Korea and India.

image copyright Getty Images image caption Sputnik 1 was the first man-made satellite to orbit Earth, launched by the Soviets in 1957

There has been the odd hiccup in the rollout.

Argentinian President Alberto Fernández tested positive for Covid-19 in April after receiving two doses of Sputnik in January and February. That's a reminder that even if the Gamaleya Institute's claimed efficacy rate of 91.6% turns out to be true, a small statistical risk remains among those who've been vaccinated.

In Europe, though, the Sputnik vaccine has created problems that are more political than epidemiological.

The EU struggles to speak with a single, convincing voice on Russia.

That's partly a matter of history and geography. Lithuania and Poland are naturally more likely to consider Russia a threat than are, say, Portugal and Malta.

And there's also the perennial problem of balancing the EU's status as an importer of Russian gas with the EU's desire to punish Russia over issues like the attempted murder of leading opposition figure Alexei Navalny or the military build-up on the border of Ukraine.

Adding European reliance on Russia for vaccine supplies into that mix is going to make the relationship harder than ever to balance.

Reuters The European Medicines Agency has publicly confirmed it has to date not received any application for a marketing authorisation for Sputnik V, despite reports stating the opposite

And yet Europe, or at least parts of Europe, are beginning to turn to Moscow out of frustration at the EU's painfully slow vaccine rollout.

'You have to think of your own interests'

Hungary has already bought and distributed considerable quantities of Sputnik V. France and Germany, among many others, are at least prepared to consider it, if and when the European Medicines Agency gives its approval. Hungary has used its right as an independent member state to grant emergency authorisation.

EPA The EU Commission said it would not sign contracts [for Sputnik] like for other manufacturers such as BioNTech, for example, so I said... we will hold bilateral talks with Russia

Veteran French diplomat Pierre Vimont, who's now a senior fellow at Carnegie Europe, says it's perfectly rational for member states to think about buying Sputnik.

""Even when you're facing an adversary,"" he told the BBC, ""you have to think of your own interests.""

Mr Vimont, as you'd expect of a man who's held some of his country's most important diplomatic postings, suggests that the European Union's attitude should be one of cautious pragmatism. That means acknowledging the excellence of Russian science but waiting for EMA authorisation as well.

He makes the point that countries using the jab on the basis of their own approval could face political difficulties with their own voters if things go wrong.

How Sputnik row brought down a prime minister

The case of Slovakia offers a salutary warning to others.

Its Prime Minister, Igor Matovic, secretly arranged to import 200,000 doses of the Russian vaccine. He was forced to leave his post late last month because he'd failed to consult his coalition partners.

image copyright EPA image caption Mr Matovic, here tendering his resignation to Slovakia's President Zuzana Caputova, has now become finance minister

Then Slovak scientists claimed the doses sent to Bratislava were different to samples of the vaccine sent elsewhere, prompting the Russians to denounce the claim as fake news and demand the return of the shipment. An offer from Hungary to approve the doses on Slovakia's behalf added a further layer of complexity.

Russia normally has to spend huge amounts of money on computer hacking and disinformation to spread discord and uncertainty in Europe. Now the vaccine appears to be achieving something similar without any effort.

Pierre Vimont of Carnegie says the Putin administration will be pleased. ""I'm sure they are enjoying this,"" he said, ""let's not be fooled. The use of vaccines by Russia and by China is a diplomatic instrument, a tool for soft power. Playing {EU} member states off against each other is naturally important to Russia.""

A notable victory for Russia

There was a similar reaction from our Eastern European diplomat, who fears that European actions over cases like the poisoning of Alexei Navalny are generally too weak.

""What the vaccines episode shows,"" he told me, ""is that we are quite capable of tying ourselves in knots over our dealings with Moscow without any help from the Russians.""

There is a long way to run with all of this.

image copyright EPA image caption Russia says Sputnik vaccines produced in Serbia could be exported around the region ""at a later stage""

Russia still has a lot to do to increase production of its vaccine even as it boldly takes orders all over the world. This week it announced it was starting production of the drug in Serbia, the first European country outside Russia and Belarus.

It may also be planning to license production in Western Europe as well as India. But there's still the need for EMA authorisation: will the Russian data and the way it was collected meet EU standards?

But for now there is no doubt that Russia has scored a notable scientific and political victory.

The original Sputnik changed the world. Sputnik V may not represent an achievement on quite that scale but it is certainly helping to change the way Russia is perceived.

A “double mutation” coronavirus variant from India has been detected in the UK.

Public Health England has reported a 77 cases of the variant, known as B.1.617, were found in the UK before April 14.

The new variant is understood to be a concern for experts due to it carrying two mutations in the spike protein which is likely to help it evade the body’s immune system.

Public Health England has described B.1.617 as a “variant under investigation”, with 73 cases of it recorded in England and four in Scotland.

Scientists expect the variant to infect the human body more easily than other variants of the virus that have previously swept through the UK, Evening Standard reports.

A professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia said the variant could be more “problematic” than those that originated in South Africa and Brazil.

Prof Paul Hunter, said: “These two escape mutations working together could be a lot more problematic than the South African and Brazilian variants who have only got one escape mutation.

“It might be even less controlled by vaccine than the Brazilian and South African variants.”

India has recorded the second most cases of coronavirus in the world with nearly 14.3 million patients infected.

1,Tear Gas Manufacturers Worried About Association With Everything Tear Gas Used For,https://www.theonion.com/tear-gas-manufacturers-worried-about-association-with-e-1830665480,"JAMESTOWN, PA—Upon learning that their products had been utilized by U.S. border patrol agents on migrants attempting to enter the country, tear gas manufacturers were reportedly worried Monday about their association with everything that tear gas is used for. “It’s troubling to turn on the news and see that our products were involved in such a heinous, violent situation where they were clearly used exactly as intended,” said Combined Systems CEO Donald Smith, echoing the concerns of other major tear gas manufacturers about seeing their products being linked to spraying protesters, refugees, and other unarmed people with tear gas. “When the media shows people with chemical burns in their eyes or choking on tear gas to the point of vomiting, it doesn’t make the average person view tear gas in a favorable light. Tear gas has always been intended for soldiers, law enforcement, and other authorities to control other, less powerful people by causing them severe pain, so any association with it being used according to its designed purpose really doesn’t look good for us. We just want to stress that our intended use for tear gas, whether it’s to disperse peaceful activists or to assault crowds of migrants, could not be any closer to what these products were actually used for.” The nation’s tear gas manufacturers added that critics of their products consistently failed to appreciate the care that they took to ensure that tear gas was not supposed to be lethal.",243,1476,12,82

China has operationalised its new biosecurity law to fortify the legal cover for the establishment and safe operation of more bio labs in the country amidst questions whether the COVID-19 originated from such a laboratory in Wuhan.

The coronavirus emerged in China's central Wuhan city in December 2019 and became a pandemic, upending life across the globe.

Under the new Biosecurity Law, China will continue to build and approve more labs specialising in advanced pathogenic microbiology with a scrupulous and scientific manner, the country's Deputy Minister of Science and Technology Xiang Libin said.

China will carry out major scientific research to enhance its biosecurity science and technological capacity against future infectious diseases, state-run Global Times quoted Xiang as saying.

The ministry has examined and approved the construction of three biosafety level-4 labs, or P4 labs, and 88 biosafety level-3 labs, or P3 labs, in China, he said.

A biosafety level (BSL), or pathogen/protection level, is a set of biocontainment precautions required to isolate dangerous biological agents in an enclosed laboratory facility.

The levels of containment range from the lowest biosafety level 1 (BSL-1) to the highest at level 4 (BSL-4).

Bai Chunli, president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said in April last year that China had two P4 labs besides 81 P3 labs in operation or approved for construction.

In contrast, the US has 12 P4 and 1,500 P3 labs, the Global Times report said.

Bio labs acquired significance as the US has alleged that the COVID-19 may have emanated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) which is a P-4 bio lab. China has strongly denied the charge.

A team of WHO experts, which probed the origin of the coronavirus, concluded last month that ""all hypotheses"" included the allegation that COVID-19 could have emanated from a bio lab ""remained open"".

World Health Organisation (WHO) Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, while receiving the report of the international experts' team which visited Wuhan, said on March 30 that ""as far as the WHO is concerned, all hypotheses remain on the table"".

""This report is a very important beginning, but it is not the end. We have not yet found the source of the virus, and we must continue to follow the science and leave no stone unturned as we do,"" he said.

Significantly, Mr Ghebreyesus said the team has concluded that leak from the WIV as alleged by former US president Donald Trump is the ""least likely hypothesis"" but it requires further probe.

""The team also visited several laboratories in Wuhan and considered the possibility that the virus entered the human population as a result of a laboratory incident.""

""However, I do not believe that this assessment was extensive enough. Further data and studies will be needed to reach more robust conclusions,"" he said.

""Although the team has concluded that a laboratory leak is the least likely hypothesis, this requires further investigation, potentially with additional missions involving specialist experts, which I am ready to deploy,"" the WHO chief added.

Yang Zhanqiu, deputy director of the pathogen biology department at Wuhan University, told the Global Times on Thursday that the law on biosafety is a timely move for China to detail the construction and management of biosafety labs and provide a legal shield for scientific projects on biosafety, including infectious diseases, to be carried out in a scrupulous and professional manner.

According to John Hopkins coronavirus tracker, China has so far reported 102,152 cases and 4,845 deaths. Globally the contagion has infected 139,228,122 people and killed 29,89,103, it said.

0,Top French court won’t prosecute Jewish woman’s killer because he was on weed,http://www.timesofisrael.com/top-french-court-wont-prosecute-jewish-womans-killer-because-he-was-on-weed,"France’s highest court on Wednesday found that the killer of a Jewish woman was not criminally responsible and could not go on trial, provoking anger from anti-racism groups who say the verdict puts Jews at risk.

Sarah Halimi, an Orthodox Jewish woman in her sixties, died in 2017 after being pushed out of the window of her Paris flat by neighbor Kobili Traore, who shouted “Allahu Akbar” (“God is great” in Arabic).

The verdict by the court means Traore will not face any trial.

In its decision Wednesday, the Court of Cassation’s Supreme Court of Appeals upheld rulings by lower tribunals that Traore cannot stand trial because he was too high on marijuana to be criminally responsible for his actions.

Traore, a heavy pot smoker, has been in psychiatric care since Halimi’s death. The court said he committed the killing after succumbing to a “delirious fit” and was thus not responsible for his actions.

Her killing stoked debate over a new strain of anti-Semitism among radicalized Muslim youths in predominantly immigrant neighborhoods.

French President Emmanuel Macron criticized the lower court’s insanity finding in January last year, drawing a sharp riposte from the country’s top magistrates, who invoked the separation of powers.

Macron said there was “a need for a trial” even if the judge decided there was no criminal responsibility.

The handling of Halimi’s slaying has been a watershed event for many French Jews, who say it underlines the French state’s failures in dealing with anti-Semitism.

“This is an additional drama that adds to this tragedy,” said the International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism (LICRA) after the ruling.

“From now on in our country, we can torture and kill Jews with complete impunity,” added the president of the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France (CRIF), Francis Kalifat.

The Simon Wiesenthal Centre’s director for international relations, Shimon Samuels, called the decision a “devastating blow,” which, he said, “potentially creates a precedent for all hate criminals to simply claim insanity or decide to smoke, snort or inject drugs or even get drunk before committing their crimes”

Following Wednesday’s verdict, lawyers representing Halimi’s family said they intend to refer the case to the European Court of Human Rights.

“It’s a bad message for French Jewish citizens,” said the lawyer for Halimi’s brother, Muriel Ouaknine Melki.

But Traore’s lawyer Patrice Spinosi said that while he could “obviously understand the victims’ frustration that there will not be a trial,” the law “in its current state” does not allow perpetrators to be tried in such circumstances.

An appeals court said Traore, now in his early 30s, had anti-Semitic bias and that the killing was partly connected to it. But it also accepted the defense claims that Traore was too high to be tried for his actions and he was placed at a psychiatric facility.

French Jews have been repeatedly targeted by jihadists in recent years, most notably in 2012, when an Islamist gunman shot dead three children and a teacher at a Jewish school in the southern city of Toulouse and in 2015 when a pro-Islamic State radical gunned down four people at a Jewish supermarket in Paris.",541,3334,13,77

REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/Pool

President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday applauded the painstaking work to restore Notre-Dame de Paris, two years after a fire destroyed the cathedral's centuries-old attic and sent its spire crashing through the vaults below.

In the hours after the blaze, Macron told a distraught nation that the cathedral, which dates back to the 12th century, would be rebuilt and later promised it would be reopened to worshippers by 2024, when France hosts the Olympic Games.

More than 700 days after workers scrambled to shore-up Notre-Dame's flying buttresses, save its 13th-century stained-glass rose windows and install movement sensors, the effort to make the site secure ahead of restoration is almost complete.

From a rooftop platform, the president, dressed in a dark boiler suit and a white safety helmet, peered down into the cathedral's damaged transept and thanked workers on the site.

""We're all impressed with what we see, with the work that has been achieved in two years. Bravo,"" Macron told workers with the Paris skyline behind him.

""We've done a lot, and we've avoided the worst.""

For many in the capital the emotion of that night remains raw.

""We were all stunned,"" said Paris resident Stacy Monsauret. ""And then it was just sadness.""

The first phase of the salvage operation was complicated by the need to cut up a 200-tonne mass of twisted metal left after the fire consumed scaffolding that had been erected around the wood-and-lead spire at the time of the blaze.

Work was also temporarily halted because of worries over lead contamination and slowed at times by the coronavirus pandemic.

Technicians still have to reinforce some of the vaults closest to those destroyed with wooden arch-shaped frames that are lifted into place by crane, and extend a tarpaulin roof over the transept to protect the restoration work once it begins.

""HOLDING UP""

The cathedral will only be declared out of danger once the phase to secure the site is complete, but all the indications were positive, said Jeremie Patrier-Leitus, a spokesman for the public body overseeing the restoration.

""The cathedral hasn't moved since the fire, it's holding up.""

The cathedral will be restored to its original design, including the 96-metre (315-feet) spire designed by architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc and added in the mid-1800s. The felling of oaks for the new spire's frame has begun. read more

Financing for the restoration was not a concern yet, said General Jean-Louis Georgelin, the former army chief of staff named by Macron to head the renovation. Some 834 million euros in donations flooded in from billionaire tycoons and households in France and abroad in the fire's aftermath.

""We will need all these donations to complete the necessary work. We need people to keep giving money,"" Georgelin told France Inter radio.

Tearful Parisians and stunned tourists gazed in disbelief while the inferno raged at the cathedral, which marks the very centre of Paris. Some sang liturgical music in harmonies late into the night as they stood vigil, while others prayed.

Brings the wealth of judicial experience that only three years on the job can provide.

Mentored by Ginsburg’s longtime friend and colleague Antonin Scalia.

Seems only fair to let Republicans control at least one branch of government for foreseeable future.

Has promised not to make judicial decisions based on all the things she believes and has promised to uphold.

1,Minneapolis Announces Plan To Replace Police Officers With Thousands Of Heavily Armed Social Workers,https://www.theonion.com/minneapolis-announces-plan-to-replace-police-officers-w-1844627586,"MINNEAPOLIS—In an effort to regain the community’s trust and better allocate city resources, Mayor Jacob Frey announced Thursday that Minneapolis would dismantle its current police force and replace it with a new bureau of heavily armed social workers, effective immediately.

The mayor outlined a plan that dramatically restructured the municipality’s approach to public safety, replacing its nearly 850 police officers with a similar number of social workers, who would be dispatched to city streets and have at their disposal firearms, bulletproof vests, tear gas, armored vehicles with gun turrets, and other tools to enhance their service to the community.

“Minneapolis has demanded a new model of security, and so today we are reallocating the police department’s entire $193 million budget to clinical social workers, case managers, and crisis counselors,” said Frey, confirming members of the newly created bureau would be issued service weapons and assigned to one of several precincts, the heads of which would report to a chief of social work. “Why continue asking police to manage this city’s homelessness crisis, for example, when we can send in social workers—those actually trained in assisting housing-insecure people—to bulldoze our homeless camps and move the inhabitants out at gunpoint?”

“We have heard your call,” Frey added, “and rest-assured: The next time you contact the authorities, a licensed professional equipped with empathy, emotional intelligence, active listening skills, and a whole lot of firepower will be headed your way.”

Training for the new bureau reportedly includes instruction not only with Glock 20s and Colt M4 Carbines but also in takedown maneuvers, chokeholds, and baton techniques, all with the goal of enabling social workers to subdue any adversary encountered while conducting routine domestic checks, meeting with trauma survivors, or visiting a child welfare agency.

Recruits to the bureau acknowledged their work should be easier now that they have the capacity to immediately neutralize every potential threat in their path.

“As a substance abuse counselor, it’s nice to know that if one of my clients starts using again, I can just Taser them and confiscate their stash,” said 47-year-old Cindy Hughes, who holds a master of social work degree from the College of St. Scholastica in Duluth and, in addition to a stun gun and sidearm, carries a Remington 700 sniper rifle in the trunk of her squad car. “It’s so much easier than getting them to go to a meeting.”

“Usually, if I’m worried they’re trying to score, we discuss sober-living facilities and ways to avoid common relapse triggers,” Hughes continued. “Now I can make extra sure they stay off the streets by simply handcuffing them to their bunk at the halfway house.”

According to Mayor Frey, out-of-work former police officers would be eligible to join the social work bureau so long as they earned the appropriate credentials, which would allow them to bring their confrontational impulses and intimidation tactics into both outpatient behavioral health centers and foster care settings.

City officials said they also planned to disband the Minneapolis Police Canine Unit and replace it with a team of local therapy dogs, which would be trained extensively in clamping their jaws onto people’s legs and ripping apart their flesh.

Sheila Bickford, a family therapist in the city for the past 30 years, told reporters her words would carry more weight now that she could enter counseling sessions outfitted with body armor, a ballistic helmet, a riot shield, and a shotgun loaded with less-lethal rounds.

“You definitely get people’s attention when you touch down in front of their home in the Child and Family Services chopper,” said Bickford, referring to her division’s UH-60 Black Hawk military surplus helicopter. “They can either listen when I tell them codependency takes a toll on the well-being and quality of your relationships, or they can get knocked down and kicked in the head until they are completely unresponsive. It’s the easy way or the hard way.”

Added Bickford, “To anyone out there who’s struggling, let me say this: We see you, we hear you, and we are here for you, ready to compel your compliance with chemical agents or the butt of an M-16.”",690,4352,14,100

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and his Greek opposite number Nikos Dendias met in Ankara to in an effort to smooth over months of tensions between the two NATO allies.

The two were expected to iron out issues over maritime boundaries that brought the two countries to the brink of military confrontation last year.

The meeting began cordially, but the two men were soon openly quarreling after Dendias said violations of Greek sovereignty would be met by sanctions.

He said that Turkish warplanes had violated Greek airspace several times and warned Turkey not to spread ""fake news.""

Cavusoglu rejected his comments as ""unacceptable"" and accused him of exploiting the meeting for domestic purposes.

""You come out here, and try to accuse Turkey, to give a message to your country. It is not possible for me to accept this,"" Cavusoglu said in response to the remarks.

Greece and Turkey, both NATO alliance members, claim the right to drill for fossil fuels in the same parts of the sea. The two sides first sat down again for talks in January after a five-year hiatus.

Cavusoglu had told Turkish TV that the two men would discuss all disagreements, emphasizing the importance of maintaining an open dialogue.

The meeting was postponed from Wednesday after a last-minute NATO summit was called.

Greece gets support from the EU

Turkey's foray into disputed waters last summer triggered a heated response from Greece, with both sides commencing military maneuvers in the region.

Turkey ultimately backed down from its exploration after it was threatened with EU sanctions. EU allies also dispatched ships to the disputed area to back Greece's claims.

The two sides have also clashed over the island of Cyprus and the flow of refugees between the neighboring countries.

The EU decided to hold off on sanctions in the end and instead proposed the expansion of a customs union and refugee pact with Turkey.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and EU Council President Charles Michel visited Ankara last week to open talks and maintain positive relations, although this meeting produced its own small crisis.

0,"Saudi, Iranian officials held direct talks in Iraq: Report",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/18/saudi-iranian-officials-held-talks-to-patch-up-relations-report,"Media report says first round of talks held in Baghdad earlier this month with the Iraqi PM facilitating the process.

Senior Saudi and Iranian officials held direct talks in a bid to repair relations between the two regional rivals, according to a report in the Financial Times which quoted officials briefed on the discussions.

The first round of the reported talks, held four years after both sides cut off diplomatic ties, took place in Baghdad on April 9 and included discussions about attacks on Saudi Arabia by Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi group.

The unnamed official quoted in the report said the Saudi delegation was led by Khalid bin Ali al-Humaidan, the kingdom’s intelligence chief, and another round of talks was also scheduled.

There has been no comment from either side following the publishing of the report.

The FT also said that a senior Saudi official denied there had been any talks with Iran.

Lebanon’s pro-Iran Al Mayadeen television channel and Unews news agency on Sunday both cited an Iranian source denying talks with Saudi Arabia.

In recent weeks, Houthi fighters have stepped up missile and drone attacks, often targeting Saudi oil facilities and military points across the kingdom, saying they are in response to deadly Saudi air raids in Yemen.

Saudi Arabia accuses Iran of smuggling weapons to the Houthis, who have control the Yemeni capital Sanaa since 2015.

The news comes as US and Iran try to revive a 2015 nuclear deal which Saudi Arabia has opposed.

Riyadh has called for a nuclear deal with stronger parameters and said Gulf states should join any negotiations on the accord to ensure that this time it addresses Iran’s missiles programme and its support for regional proxies.

The US has also pressed for an end to the Yemen conflict, seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

The report added that Iraq’s Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi visited Saudi Arabia late last month and has been facilitating the “process”.

Citing an Iraqi official, FT reported that Baghdad also facilitated “communication channels” for Iran with Egypt and Jordan.

“The [Iraqi] prime minister is very keen to personally play a role in turning Iraq into a bridge between these antagonistic powers in the region,” the official said. “It’s in Iraq’s interest that it can play this role. The more confrontation you have in the region, the more they play out here… and these talks have been taking place.”

Iraq is also home to powerful Iranian-backed militia groups, as well as US troops, and has often been used as a battleground.

In January 2020, a US drone strike killed Iran’s revered general Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi militia commander, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, pushing Washington and Tehran to the brink of war.

Iran retaliated by targeting an Iraqi military airbase where US troops were stationed.

Another official briefed on the latest talks said Kadhimi has “good links into the Iranian system”, FT reported.

“The new thing is Kadhimi playing this role with Saudi Arabia… It’s a good thing Iraq is playing this role, but it’s very early days.”",514,3102,9,58
1,This aged very well,https://local.theonion.com/ghost-of-christmas-future-taunts-children-with-visions-1819566694,"SOUTHFIELD, MI—Bored with scaring elderly misers, the Ghost of Christmas Future is spending the holiday season taunting modern children with visions of Christmas 2016's hottest toy: the Sony PlayStation 5, a 2,048-bit console featuring a 45-Ghz trinary processor, CineReal graphics booster with 2-gig biotexturing, and an RSP connector for 360-degree online-immersion play.

The Ghost of Christmas Future offers a pair of Phoenix 10-year-olds a tantalizing glimpse of the PS5.

""You know how kids are—a year is an eternity to them,"" the wraithlike specter said Monday during a visit to the Southfield home of 13-year-old Josh Kuehn. ""So just imagine showing them something they'll have to wait 14 years for. Teasing them with a glimpse of the PS5 is the ultimate torture. They absolutely lose their minds. It's like saying, 'Hey, kid, you'll be an old man before you ever get to touch this.'""

The Ghost of Christmas Future said he has visited more than 125,000 homes since Thanksgiving, offering children an agonizing sneak peek at what they cannot have for another decade and a half.

""I like to appear in the living room with a PS5 hooked up to 2016's most popular TV, the 4'x8' Hi-Def Sony Titania,"" the Ghost said. ""Then, I'll say in my best spooky voice, 'Jimmy! Behold what your kids will be playing while you're slaving away at an office job to support them!'""

Driving the children mad with PS5 lust, the Ghost said, is a multi-step process.

""I usually start by showing them Toteki Aluminum, one of the future's most popular fight-and-chase games,"" the Ghost said. ""It's far from the best available in 2016, but it always blows their mind to see the guy get hit with the falling sign while the drops of sweat fly off his face. You can see the whole scene, distorted, in each of the individual drops. That gives them a good preliminary idea of the graphics technology we're dealing with.""

The Ghost said he then likes to show Airsledz, a racing game in which jet-powered sleds whoosh through a four-dimensional racing course in the sky. The game, he said, enables the player to compete online against dozens of other players all around the world.

""They always ask if you can play it on the Internet—it's so cute how they still call it 'the Internet'—and I tell them, 'Hey, you can play this against 63 other PS5 owners simultaneously. At least you can in 14 years,'"" the Ghost said. ""And you should see their jaws hit the floor when they learn about the add-on accessories that enable users to actually fly around the room during gameplay.""

Once the capabilities of the system are conveyed to the children, the Ghost likes to push them further over the edge by showing them games specially targeted to their age group.

Aaron Booker of Dayton, OH, samples the PlayStation 5.

Younger children, he said, salivate upon seeing Level One of Zonic Fugue. In it, Zonic, the indigo-colored son of Sonic The Hedgehog, faces off against Chuckles The Echidna in a Terrordactyl sky-joust, attempting to earn the Ankle Rockets he needs to gather the five Chaos Sapphires that, when combined, form the master key that opens the Melody Dome.

To break the spirits of children 12 and up, the Ghost runs a brief demonstration of Back To Werewolf Island. The horror-action thriller, he said, will be produced in full 10.8 Omneo sound and feature new music from 40 of 2016's hottest skagcore acts, including FU3P, Dredgerous, and Frances Cobain.

""Sometimes, the kids will start getting defensive and say, 'Yeah, well, I don't know any of those characters, so big deal,'"" the Ghost said. ""That's when I pull out DC vs. Marvel.""

The Ghost said he shows the children a brief clip of DC vs. Marvel, in which cinema-realistic figures of Spider-Man and the Joker dash across impossibly detailed city streets, attacking each other with dozens of different offensive maneuvers while leaping, somersaulting, and throwing objects.

""They usually start trembling at that point,"" the Ghost said. ""That's when I go in for the kill by casually mentioning that the game comes packaged with the 2016 feature film of the same name—not on DVD, of course, but on SCAP. Ten times better.""

The few children unbroken by DC vs. Marvel are invariably finished off by the sight of Star Wars—Episode IX: Jedi Destiny, a game which employs the world's most advanced artificial-intelligence algorithm to place the player inside the film's climactic battle sequence on the planet Mon Jeedam.

""With more than 12,000 distinct soldiers, creatures, and vehicles fighting at once, and the option to command the New Republic Fleet, the Imperial Armada, or the Yuuzhan Vong Invasion Force, it's not merely the best Star Wars game that's ever existed; it's an interactive film that looks better than any movie that's ever been made. No child has failed to sob hysterically at the sight of it.""

0,AMLO to propose extending social programme to Central America,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/18/amlo-to-propose-extending-social-programme-to-central-america,"Mexican president says he wants to propose to Joe Biden to extend aid programme in effort to curb migration to the US.

Mexico’s president has said he plans to propose to his US counterpart Joe Biden a plan to extend to Central America a key Mexican social programme, as part of ongoing efforts to stem migration to the United States.

In a video message on Sunday, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he wants to propose offering the Sembrando Vida programme, which provides work and support for the agricultural sector in Central America.

“What I want to propose is that the program Sembrando Vida is implemented in Central America,” Lopez Obrador said in the video.

“So people aren’t forced to migrate, and it helps the environment.”

Thousands of migrants and asylum seekers from Central America and Mexico have taken often perilous journeys north towards the US in recent years, fuelled by economic hardships, gang violence and natural disasters, among other things.

US officials apprehended more than 172,000 people who had crossed into the country at its southern border with Mexico in March alone.

Many of those who crossed into the US were expelled under a Trump-era policy that effectively sealed the border to most migrants due to the coronavirus pandemic.

But the Biden administration is allowing unaccompanied children into the country, as well as some families – prompting it to deploy additional federal resources to the border and to open additional facilities to house people.

As of Thursday, more than 22,000 children were in US government custody, the Associated Press (AP) news agency reported, including more than 2,500 who were still in substandard facilities run by US border authorities.

“As it currently stands with a lot of these emergency intake sites, children are going in and there’s no way out,” Leecia Welch, the senior director of legal advocacy and child welfare at the National Center for Youth Law, told AP. “They’re complete dead ends.”

Asylum seekers from Central America who were deported from the US walk near the Lerdo Stanton international border bridge in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, on March 30 [Edgard Garrido/Reuters] Biden has said he plans to address the “root causes” of migration, especially in the so-called Northern Triangle countries of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to curb arrivals at the border.

Last month, he appointed Vice President Kamala Harris to lead that effort, and she is expected to visit Mexico and Guatemala soon for talks on migration.

A US official said last week that Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras had agreed to deploy troops to their borders in an effort to stem the flow of migration.

“We’ve secured agreements for them to put more troops on their own border,” Tyler Moran, a special assistant to Biden for immigration policy, told the MSNBC news outlet.

Meanwhile, Lopez Obrador said on Sunday that he believed the Sembrando Vida programme could create thousands of jobs across southern Mexico and the Central American countries.",490,3015,9,61

REUTERS/Lisi Niesner

Saudi and Iranian officials held direct talks this month in a bid to ease tensions between the two foes, a senior Iranian official and two regional sources said, as Washington works to revive a 2015 nuclear pact with Tehran and end the Yemen war.

The April 9 meeting in Iraq, first reported by the Financial Times on Sunday, did not lead to any breakthrough, the Iranian official and one of the regional sources familiar with the matter said.

The regional source said the meeting focused on Yemen, where a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia has been battling the Iran-aligned Houthi group since March 2015.

""This was a low-level meeting to explore whether there might be a way to ease ongoing tensions in the region,"" the Iranian official said, adding that it was based on Iraq's request.

Iraq's prime minister held talks with Saudi Arabia's crown prince earlier this month and also visited the United Arab Emirates.

The second regional source said the talks also touched on Lebanon, which is facing a political vacuum amid a dire financial crisis. Gulf Arab states are alarmed by the expanding role of Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement.

Saudi authorities did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The FT report said that a senior Saudi official denied there had been any talks with Iran.

Sunni Gulf power Saudi Arabia cut ties with Shi'ite Iran in January 2016 following the storming of its embassy in Tehran in a row over Riyadh's execution of a Shi'ite Muslim cleric.

A Western diplomat in the region said the United States and Britain were informed in advance of the Saudi-Iran talks but had ""not seen the outcome"".

Washington and Tehran are holding indirect talks in Vienna to revive the world powers' nuclear accord with Iran, which former U.S. President Donald Trump quit in 2018. Tehran has breached several nuclear restrictions after Trump reimposed sanctions.

Riyadh last week called for a nuclear deal with stronger parameters and for involvement of Gulf states, which are concerned about Iran's missiles programme and its support for regional proxies.

The United States is also pressing for a ceasefire deal in Yemen which Riyadh and the Saudi-backed Yemeni government have welcomed. The Houthis have yet to accept and have kept up cross border missile and drone attacks on Saudi cities.

A Saudi foreign ministry official told Reuters last week that confidence-building measures could pave the way for expanded nuclear talks with Gulf Arab participation. read more

Those sentenced include the city’s so-called “father of democracy” Martin Lee as well as pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai.

They were found guilty earlier this month of organising and participating in a massive protest in August 2019, where an estimated 1.7 million people marched in opposition to a bill that would have allowed suspects to be extradited to mainland China for trial.

The protest was not authorised by the police.

Their convictions and sentencing were the latest blow to the city’s flagging democracy movement, amid an ongoing crackdown by Beijing and Hong Kong authorities on dissent in the semi-autonomous Chinese city.

Lee, an 82-year-old lawyer and former lawmaker known for his advocacy of human rights and democracy in the city, had his sentence of 11 months in prison suspended after his age was taken into consideration.

Lai, the founder of Hong Kong’s Apple Daily tabloid, was sentenced to 12 months in prison. Prior to sentencing, he was remanded in jail on other charges, including collusion with foreign forces to intervene in the city’s affairs — a new crime under a national security law imposed on the city in 2020 by the central government in Beijing.

Lawyers Albert Ho and Margaret Ng both had their 12-month jail sentences suspended. Former lawmaker Leung Kwok-hung was sentenced to 18 months, while another former legislator, Cyd Ho, was given a jail sentence of eight months.

Two other former lawmakers, Au Nok-hin and Leung Yiu-chung, who previously pleaded guilty were also given jail sentences. Au was sentenced to 10 months in prison, while Leung’s eight-month jail term was suspended.

China's new political view of Hong Kong

Beijing had pledged to allow the city to retain civil liberties not permitted in mainland China for 50 years after the former British colony reverted to Chinese rule in 1997, but recently has ushered in a series of measures, including a national security legislation and electoral reforms, that many fear are a step closer to making Hong Kong no different from cities on the mainland.

It’s been almost a decade since the last release in Bethesda’s beloved fantasy series, but it seems some cool new tidbits about the hotly anticipated sixth installment are just around the bend! Our hounds have been stalking series director Todd Howard through the evening, day in and day out, for nearly a full fortnight, and the tracks from his blood loss suggest he’s slowing down far too quickly to ever outrun us.

These woods are deep and treacherous, gamers. Mr. Howard will not continue long with his broken leg—not without telling us everything he knows about where, exactly, Elder Scrolls VI will take place on the continent of Tamriel. Wily and stout though Todd Howard may be, we all have our breaking points, and that means a new trove of information on the next Elder Scrolls is undoubtedly on the way.

Admittedly, Howard evaded our scouts at the frozen river junction. He deftly navigated through our bear traps in the prairie frost. But judging by the stained bandages we found hastily discarded in the snow, Howard is beginning to succumb to the elements. Soon, his mind will turn on him, and then he will tell us all he knows about the supposed customizable runic magic system and how that will impact the core gameplay experience beloved by Elder Scrolls fans the world over!

Frostbite can be painful, indeed, gaming fans. Eventually, a man may decide the simpler path than fleeing is simply confessing the exact details of what roll the Aldmeri Dominion could play in the new game’s narrative, or if any new joinable factions like the Dawnguard will figure into all of this. Boy, these sure are exciting days to be an open-world fantasy diehard!

To be frank, there were times during our hunt that we feared we would never be able to tell you whether we might see the rebuilt Orsinium, or if dragons might make a reappearance from Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Howard is a worthy prey, indeed. He has often thrown us off his track with false footprints and brush coverings. But this delicious game of cat-and-mouse is coming to an end. Our bloodhounds have picked up his scent for the last time. He is hungry and alone.

It is only a matter of time, gamers.



So check back soon when we’ll be sure to have everything you need to know from the mouth of this legendary game developer! And sound off in comments to let us know if there’s anything you want us to ask the man himself. Just make sure you get in your comments quickly! Based on the latest tracks we found in the snow, it seems like he’s reduced to crawling now and we’re sure to have him in our clutches within the day!

The three members of the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahvaz (ASMLA) were arrested in February last year and have been in custody since.

""This is a very serious case where persons in Denmark have carried out illegal intelligence activities and financed and promoted terrorism from Denmark in other countries,"" public prosecutor Lise-Lotte Nilas said in a statement.

The trial will start on April 29 and will be held in the Roskilde district court. The defendants face prison sentences of up to 12 years.

In a related case, a Norwegian of Iranian heritage was sentenced to seven years in June last year for spying for an Iranian intelligence service and plotting to assassinate one of the ASMLA-members. That verdict has been appealed.

„Na základě jednoznačných důkazů získaných vyšetřováním našich bezpečnostních složek musím konstatovat, že existuje důvodné podezření o zapojení důstojníků ruské tajné služby GRU, jednotky 29155, do výbuchu muničních skladů areálu Vrbětice v roce 2014,“ uvedl Babiš.

„Česká republika je svrchovaný stát a musí na tato bezprecedentní zjištění odpovídajícím způsobem reagovat,“ dodal premiér.

Radiožurnál má informace z vysoce postaveného zdroje, že cílem akce ruských agentů byl zřejmě bulharský obchodník se zbraněmi Emilian Gebrev. „Vybouchlo to, co už koupil a co začal vyskladňovat,“ uvedl zdroj. O přítomnosti Rusů údajně svědčí série nepřímých důkazů.

Our job is just to represent the political moment—from the violent Antifa protests to Chase’s PTSD-fraught leave of absence—using the only medium we have, and I believe we did that.” At press time, the PAW Patrol writers remained silent about the episode involving the deportation of thousands of Chihuahuas accused of stealing jobs and crippling Adventure Bay’s economy.",224,1386,17,103

Iran and world powers have resumed talks in Vienna aimed at bringing the U.S. back into the nuclear deal it left in 2018. Following a positive round of talks last week, the mood feels very different in the Austrian capital after an attack on a major Iranian nuclear facility on Sunday. Iran blames Israel for the incident in Natanz and has said it will increase its uranium enrichment to 60 percent in response.

The identity of the triangle- or pyramid-shaped aerial objects remains a mystery. The Defense Department isn’t sharing what it knows.

The photos and videos were first published by the Mystery Wire and Extraordinary Beliefs websites. The objects were photographed zipping over the USS Russell off San Diego in July 2019, according to investigative filmmaker Jeremy Corbell.

Photos of three unidentified flying objects reportedly taken in March that year — one spherical, another “acorn” shaped, and one described as a “metallic blimp” — were also taken by Navy personnel, Pentagon spokesperson Susan Gough told CNN.

Mystery Wire’s George Knapp reported that those objects were photographed off Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia by an F-18 weapons systems officer seated behind the pilot, who used his iPhone.

Gough offered no details on either of the sightings.

“To maintain operations security and to avoid disclosing information that may be useful to potential adversaries, the Department of Defense does not discuss publicly the details of either the observations or the examinations of reported incursions into our training ranges or designated airspace — including those incursions initially designated as UAP,” Gough told CNN, using the abbreviation for Unidentified Aerial Phenomena.

A new Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force, created last August to investigate such sightings by the military, has “included these incidents in their ongoing examinations,” Gough said.

0,Italy to make climate change study compulsory in schools,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-climate-change-italy-exclusive-idUKKBN1XF1E5,"ROME (Reuters) - Italy will next year become the world’s first country to make it compulsory for schoolchildren to study climate change and sustainable development, Education Minister Lorenzo Fioramonti said.

Fioramonti, from the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, is the government’s most vocal supporter of green policies and was criticised by the opposition in September for encouraging students to skip school and take part in climate protests.

In an interview in his Rome office on Monday, Fioramonti said all state schools would dedicate 33 hours per year, almost one hour per school week, to climate change issues from the start of the next academic year in September.

Many traditional subjects, such as geography, mathematics and physics, would also be studied from the perspective of sustainable development, said the minister, a former economics professor at South Africa’s Pretoria University.

“The entire ministry is being changed to make sustainability and climate the centre of the education model,” Fioramonti told Reuters in the interview conducted in fluent English.

“I want to make the Italian education system the first education system that puts the environment and society at the core of everything we learn in school.”

Fioramonti, 42, the author of several books arguing gross domestic product should no longer be used as the main measure of countries’ economic success, has been a target of the right-wing opposition since becoming a minister in the two-month-old government of 5-Star and the centre-left Democratic Party.

His proposals for new taxes on airline tickets, plastic and sugary foods to raise funds for education were strongly attacked by critics who said Italians were already over-taxed.

He then sparked fury from conservatives when he suggested crucifixes should be removed from Italian classrooms to create a more inclusive environment for non-Christians.

Despite the criticism, the government’s 2020 budget presented to parliament this week included both the plastic tax and a new tax on sugary drinks.

“I was ridiculed by everyone and treated like a village idiot, and now a few months later the government is using two of those proposals and it seems to me more and more people are convinced it is the way to go,” Fioramonti said.

ANTI-SALVINI

Surveys showed 70-80% of Italians backed taxing sugar and flights, he said, adding that coalition lawmakers had told him they would table budget amendments to introduce his proposal to hike air ticket prices before the budget is approved by end-year.

Fioramonti said targeted taxes of this kind were a way of discouraging types of consumption which were harmful to the environment or individuals, while generating resources for schools, welfare or lowering income tax.

In this vein, he suggested other levies on various types of gambling and on profits from oil drilling.

His progressive positions on the economy and the environment are the antithesis of Matteo Salvini’s hard-right League, which has overtaken 5-Star to become easily Italy’s most popular party, with more than 30% of voter support.

Fioramonti said the new government, which has got off to a shaky start with weeks of bickering over the budget, “will only last if it is brave,” and stops letting Salvini set the news agenda.

“I want to represent the Italy that stands against all the things that Salvini does,” Fioramonti said. “We have to build a different narrative and not be afraid of saying something Salvini may not like, because that’s why we exist.”",588,3728,9,56

In his second ‘Talk to the People’ address this week following his video call with Russia Pres. Vladimir Putin, Duterte bared he did not know when the Philippines would get enough COVID-19 vaccines to inoculate all Filipinos.

“Itong vaccine na itong pinag-usapan natin ganito, wala sana ito kung mayroong vaccine available. Eh wala. Hanggang ngayon the word ‘unavailable’ is nandiyan. Unavailable because there are not — there’s no sufficient supply to inoculate the world,” Duterte said in a pre-recorded speech aired Thursday.

(We won’t be talking about vaccines if supply is readily available. But there is none. Until now, the word is ‘unavailable’. Unavailable because there’s not sufficient supply to inoculate the world.)

“Matagal pa ito. Sabihin ko sa iyo marami pang mamamatay dito. Hindi ko lang maturo kung sino,” he added.

(This will take long. I tell you, many more will die because of this. I just can’t say who.)

So far, the Philippines has recorded 15,594 deaths due to COVID-19.

In order to achieve herd immunity, the Philippines has targeted to vaccinate 70 percent of its population or 70 million people. But the country has only so far vaccinated over 1 million individuals.

Of this number, more than 162,000 individuals already received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.

Surat: The heavy rush of bodies at Surat crematoriums over the last two weeks has taken a toll on its ‘modern’ infrastructure. City crematoriums equipped with gas furnaces are being used for cremation round the clock. As a result, the iron frames on which the bodies are placed inside the gas furnace has started melting at all crematoriums.

Gas furnaces at all three crematoriums of Diamond City are facing the melting issue. A similar issue has also come up in neighbouring Bardoli town.

Along with the melting of frames, the burners also require frequent maintenance as they are being used round the clock. “Earlier we used to cremate 20 bodies in a day of which few were cremated on a wood pyre while others were cremated in gas furnaces. The load was limited and each furnace got enough time to cool down. But now, we are handling over 80 bodies daily and each furnace is in use round the clock. Hence the iron frames have started melting and breaking,” said an official at Ramnath Ghela Crematorium (RGC).

At Ashwini Kumar Crematorium (AKC) too currently two furnaces are not working. “The frames are melting and gas burners get clogged. As the furnaces are in constant use, we are facing this difficulty,” said an official at AKC.

Kurukshetra Crematorium (KC) has employed a team of technicians for frequent maintenance of the gas furnaces. “We have employed a team which is available round the clock to repair the furnace. Due to 24 hours use the furnaces break down many times,” said an official at KC.

GENEVA, April 16 (Reuters) - The number of new COVID-19 cases per week has nearly doubled globally over the past two months, approaching the highest rate seen so far during the pandemic, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday.

""Cases and deaths are continuing to increase at worrying rates,"" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a briefing focused on Papua New Guinea (PNG) and the western Pacific region.

He said he was very worried about the potential for a much larger epidemic in PNG, and it was vital the country received more COVID-19 vaccines as soon as possible.

PNG has now reported more than 9,300 COVID-19 cases and 82 deaths. ""While these numbers are still smaller than other countries, the increase is sharp and WHO is very concerned about the potential for a much larger epidemic,"" Tedros said.

PNG health minister Jelta Wong said there was on ongoing challenge in the country to get people wearing masks and disbelief about the disease itself, which would complicate efforts to role out vaccines.

WHO officials said three emergency medical teams had arrived in PNG this week from Australia, the United States and Germany.

""The situation is extremely challenging right now,"" Takeshi Kasai, WHO regional director for the western Pacific, said of PNG. (Reporting by Stephanie Ulmer-Nebehay and Emma Farge. Editing by Mark Potter)

Speaking ahead of a global summit on the climate crisis this week that will be helmed by US President Joe Biden, Mr Kerry said the need to tackle the climate issue was “extremely urgent”.

“The word ‘urgent’ is totally applicable to the current crisis that we’re in because countries are simply not getting the job done,” Mr Kerry said in an interview with Sky News’ Sophy Ridge on Sunday.

“Even if we did everything that we set out to do in the Paris Agreement, the Earth’s temperature is going to increase a very significant amount, perhaps as much as 3.7 degrees or more,” the climate envoy said. “And the reason for the real urgency now is that because we’re not getting done what we said we’d do in Paris, it’s actually heading towards 4 degrees or more.”

“That’s beyond catastrophic in the consequences to food production, water, habitability in various parts of the planet, the melting of ice, the sea level rise, the warming - all the consequences,” he said.

Noting the US’s role in that, particularly with Mr Trump having withdrawn the US from the Paris Agreement - a decision Mr Biden reversed on his first day in office, Mr Kerry apologised for the former administration’s actions.

“We are very sorry for the last four years with a president who didn’t care about science and who didn’t have a real rationale for pulling out, but he was the only president in the world, the only leader in the world, who pulled out of this [Paris] agreement,” Mr Kerry said.

“President Biden said the first thing he’d do as president is return; we’ve done that and now with this summit we’re going to try and bring nations to the table to do what we need to do to get the job done for future generations,” he said.

“...This is why we bring nations together and, unfortunately, the United States became a renegade in the last four years under the non-leadership of President Trump, but we are now back and present with a very aggressive series of initiatives in order to try to make up for lost time.”

MOSCOW (AP) — Associates of imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny called Sunday for massive protests in the heart of Moscow and St. Petersburg on Wednesday, saying Navalny’s health is deteriorating severely during a hunger strike.

Leonid Volkov, a top strategist for Navalny, said the demonstrations were called with three days’ notice because “his life hangs in the balance....We don’t know how long he can hold on. But it is clear we do not have time.”

The 44-year-old Navalny, President Vladimir Putin’s most visible and persistent critic, started a hunger strike more than three weeks ago to protest prison authorities’ refusal to allow him to be seen by a private doctor. He says he is suffering from severe back pain and loss of feeling in his legs, and that the medical care in prison inadequate; the Russian penitentiary service says he is getting appropriate care.

Several doctors went Sunday to the prison colony about 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Moscow where Navalny is serving time but were not allowed in to see him.

“It’s cruel and monstrous to deny access to a dying patient,” Anastasia Vasilyeva, the head of a Navalny-backed doctors’ union, said outside the prison.

A doctor said Saturday that test results he received from Navalny’s family showed sharply elevated levels of potassium, which could lead to cardiac arrest, and signs of kidney failure.

“Our patient could die at any moment,” the doctor, Yaroslav Ashikhmin, said.

There was no immediate comment from police or government officials about the call for protests, but the response is likely to be harsh. Police arrested more than 10,000 people during nationwide protests in January demanding Navalny’s freedom.

The Wednesday protests have been called for symbolically resonant locations — Manezh Square in Moscow, just outside the Kremlin walls, and St. Petersburg’s sprawling Palace Square.

Navalny was arrested on Jan. 17 when he returned to Russia from Germany, where he spent five months recovering from poisoning with a Soviet era nerve agent that he blames on the Kremlin. Russian officials have denied any involvement and questioned whether Navalny was poisoned, although several European laboratories confirmed that he was sickened with a Novichok nerve agent. .

Navalny was ordered to serve 2 1/2 years in prison on the grounds that his long recovery in Germany violated the terms of a suspended sentence he received for a fraud conviction in a case that Navalny says was politically motivated.

His arrest and subsequent health problems have brought repeated criticism from the West.

“We call on the Russian authorities to grant him immediate access to medical professionals he trusts,” European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Sunday. “The EU will continue to call for his immediate and unconditional release as we consider his sentencing politically motivated and running counter to Russia’s international human rights obligations.”

National security adviser Jake Sullivan said on CNN television that the United States is concerned about Navalny’s health.

“We have communicated to the Russian government that what happens to Mr. Navalny is their responsibility and they will be held accountable by the international community,” Sullivan said. “We have communicated that there will be consequences if Mr. Navalny dies.”",675,4288,9,60

The tech billionaire's firm was chosen ahead of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin and defence contractor Dynetics Inc.

Steve Jurczyk, NASA's acting administrator, said at a video conference: ""We should accomplish the next landing as soon as possible. This is an incredible time to be involved in human exploration, for all humanity.""

SpaceX will need to complete a test flight ""to fully check out all systems with a landing on the lunar surface prior to our formal demonstration mission"", NASA official Lisa Watson-Morgan told reporters.

Mr Musk is one of the world's richest people thanks to his 22% stake in electric car maker Tesla, now the world's most valuable vehicle manufacturer.

His publicly stated aim is to put humans on Mars - but so far, SpaceX has mainly been used to launch satellites for his Starlink internet venture, and other satellites and space cargo.

The SpaceX programme has suffered considerable teething problems, with another failed landing for its prototype Starship spacecraft last month.

The previous three exploded at touchdown or shortly afterwards.

Those setbacks do not appear to have affected investors' confidence in his schemes, however, as SpaceX said on Wednesday it had raised about $1.16bn (£838m) in equity financing.

NASA's plan is get back to the moon and using that as a platform to send astronauts to Mars and it is looking to team up with private companies that share its vision for space exploration.

In December, NASA announced 18 astronauts who could be involved in plans to get back to the moon by 2024.

0,Russian security service detains Ukrainian diplomat,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/17/russian-security-service-detains-ukrainian-diplomat,"Russia on Saturday said it would expel a Ukrainian diplomat, prompting an immediate pledge of retaliation from Kyiv, further escalating tensions after Moscow’s troop buildup on Ukraine’s eastern flank.

The detention of a Ukrainian consul in the second city, St Petersburg, comes at a time of global concern over a possible repeat of Moscow’s 2014 aggression, when Russia annexed the peninsula of Crimea and backed separatists in Ukraine’s east. Moscow claimed that the diplomat had been caught “red-handed” trying to obtain sensitive information.

In response, the Ukrainian foreign ministry condemned “the illegal” detention of its diplomat and said Kyiv would expel a senior Russian diplomat in response.

Kyiv has been battling Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine since 2014 and the clashes there intensified early this year, effectively shredding a ceasefire agreed last July.

About 30 Ukrainian troops have been killed since the start of the year, compared with 50 in all of 2020. Most were victims of sniper fire.

Russia has detained a number of Ukrainian nationals on suspicion of spying in recent years, but it is rare for diplomats to be arrested.

“A Ukrainian diplomat, a consul of Ukraine’s consulate general in Saint Petersburg, Alexander Sosonyuk, has been detained by Russia’s FSB,” the security service said in a statement, using the Russian-language spelling of his name.

He was held on Friday, the security service said. Kyiv said the diplomat had spent several hours in detention.

The Russian foreign ministry said on Saturday it had summoned Ukraine’s chargé d’affaires, Vasyl Pokotylo, and told him that the Ukrainian diplomat had 72 hours to leave the country from 19 April. “The Russian side pointed to the inadmissibility of such kind of activity,” the ministry said in a statement.

Russia’s domestic intelligence agency said Sosonyuk had been caught “red-handed” during a meeting with a Russian national as he sought to receive “classified” information.

“Such activity is not compatible with his diplomatic status and is clearly hostile in nature towards the Russian Federation,” the FSB said. “In conformity with international law, measures will be taken against the foreign diplomat.”

In Kyiv, the Ukrainian foreign ministry said it contested the diplomat’s detention and rejected Russia’s accusations. Spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said Russia had “crudely” violated diplomatic conventions and sought to escalate tensions.

“In response to the abovementioned provocation, a senior diplomat of the Russian embassy in Kyiv must leave Ukrainian territory within 72 hours beginning 19 April,” Nikolenko told AFP. He did not provide further details.

Faced with the largest deployment of Russian troops on Ukraine’s borders since 2014, the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has requested more help from the west, and western leaders have urged the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to stop intimidating his neighbour.

Tensions between Russia and Ukraine come against the background of a new war of words between Moscow and Washington as the new US president, Joe Biden, seeks to take a tougher line against Putin.

The US on Thursday announced sanctions and the expulsion of 10 Russian diplomats in retaliation for what the White House says is the Kremlin’s US election interference, a massive cyber-attack, and other hostile activity.

Russia said on Friday that it would expel US diplomats and sanction US officials in response, while recommending that the US envoy leave Russia “for consultations”.",543,3537,6,51

The releases were announced on the state broadcaster, MRTV, which said the junta chief, Min Aung Hlaing, had pardoned 23,047 prisoners, including 137 foreigners who will be deported. He also reduced sentences for others.

It comes as daily protests against the 1 February ousting of the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi continue, as does the use of deadly force against them.

According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which monitors casualties and arrests, government forces have killed at least 728 protesters and bystanders since the takeover. The group says 3,141 people, including Aung San Suu Kyi, are in detention.

Unconfirmed but credible accounts with photos on social media claimed three people were killed on Saturday by security forces in a violent crackdown in the central city of Mogok, in Myanmar’s gem-mining region.

Detainees released on Saturday from Insein prison in Yangon included at least three political prisoners jailed in 2019, said witnesses and local reports.

The three are members of the Peacock Generation performance troupe who were arrested during that year’s new year celebrations for skits that poked fun at military representatives in parliament and military involvement in business.

Their traditional style of acting is called Thangyat, a mashup of poetry, comedy and music with a sharp undertone of satire. Several members of the troupe were convicted under a law banning circulation of information that could endanger or demoralise members of the military. The actors may have particularly angered the military because they performed in army uniforms.

Several members were also found guilty of online defamation for livestreaming their performances. It could not be ascertained if all imprisoned members of the troupe were released.

Another freed prisoner was Ross Dunkley, an Australian newspaper entrepreneur sentenced in 2019 to 13 years in prison for drug possession. His release was confirmed by his ex-wife, Cynda Johnston, reported the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper.

Dunkley co-founded the Myanmar Times, an English-language daily, but was forced to give up his share in it. He became well-known for co-founding or acquiring English-language publications in formerly socialist states that were seeking foreign investment as they liberalised their economies, but was sometimes criticised for doing business with authoritarian regimes.

Early prisoner releases are customary during major holidays in Myanmar and this is the second batch the ruling junta has announced since taking power.

After the release of more than 23,000 convicts to mark Union Day on 12 February, there were reports on social media that some were recruited by the authorities to carry out violence at night in residential areas to spread panic, especially by setting fires. Some areas responded by setting up their own neighbourhood watch groups.

In March, more than 600 people who were imprisoned for protesting against the February coup were released from Insein prison, a rare conciliatory gesture by the military that appeared aimed at placating the protest movement.

Those freed were mostly young people caught up in sweeps of street demonstrations, while those considered protest leaders were kept locked up.

Neither the military government nor those opposed to it show any signs of backing off from their struggle for power. Western nations have tried to pressure the military through diplomatic and economic sanctions with little effect.

Myanmar’s south-east Asian neighbours, concerned about regional instability, are trying to get the junta on the path to restoring democracy, or at least end its violent repression.

A spokesperson for Thailand’s foreign ministry said Min Aung Hlaing had confirmed he would attend a summit meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations on 24 April.

Tanee Sangrat said in a text message to journalists that Brunei, the current chair of the 10-nation body, confirmed it had proposed the date for a meeting at the group’s secretariat in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. Indonesia has taken the lead in calling for the special meeting to discuss the Myanmar crisis.",679,4407,11,71

Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a statement said the Ugandan government’s actions “represent a continued downward trajectory for the country’s democracy and respect for human rights.“ The election in which longtime President Yoweri Museveni won a sixth term “was neither free nor fair,“ Blinken said.

The statement did not say who is affected by the visa restrictions.

The election was a generational clash between Museveni, 76, and the popular singer and opposition lawmaker known as Bobi Wine 39, who was detained and harassed multiple times ahead of the vote. Wine later alleged widespread irregularities in the election.

Blinken said that “opposition candidates were routinely harassed, arrested, and held illegally without charge. Ugandan security forces were responsible for the deaths and injuries of dozens of innocent bystanders and opposition supporters.” Civil society figures were intimidated and arrested, and journalists were targeted with violence, he said.

Uganda’s government limited accreditation for election observers to the point where the United States decided not to observe at all.

0,Beijing anger as pro-democracy documentary wins Oscar-nomination,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/18/beijing-anger-as-pro-democracy-documentary-wins-oscar-nomination,"Anders Hammer moved to Hong Kong in 2019 to capture a David versus Goliath battle on camera, filming pro-democracy protesters in the city taking on autocrats in Beijing.

Little over a year later he became an inadvertent protagonist in that fight, when his low budget documentary Do Not Split won an Oscar nomination.

Chinese authorities, apparently enraged or worried by the platform the star-studded evening might give the film, and by long-deleted comments from best director nominee Chloé Zhao, has reportedly told local media not to broadcast the ceremony live, and play down all coverage of the awards.

Hammer is bemused at the lengths to which China has gone to stop its citizens catching even a brief glimpse of his latest film. In the rest of the world, that move has earned him the type of press coverage he could never have dreamt of.

“We are part of a category, short documentaries, which is not normally one that gets most attention [in Oscar coverage],” he said. “It’s ironic Beijing is actually at this point promoting our documentary.”

His half-hour exploration of the protest is beautifully filmed in a fluid, intimate style that takes the viewer into the intense heart of street demonstrations.

Millions marched in peace through Hong Kong’s streets in the summer of 2019, originally spurred by anger at a law that would have allowed the city to extradite people to face trial in the mainland’s opaque and judicial system.

As the protests expanded into broader demands for democracy, the police response became increasingly brutal. By the end of the year students were besieged in their university campus, stuffing molotov cocktails to take on police who were now liberal with their use of tear gas, rubber bullets and even live ammunition.

Coronavirus brought the public demonstrations to an abrupt end, and soon afterwards Beijing passed a security law for Hong Kong that effectively ended the city’s limited autonomy and has been used to crush the pro-democracy movement.

Key figures are mostly in jail, in exile or awaiting trial. Even protest slogans and songs have been banned under the new legislation. The Norwegian director believes Beijing’s fear of a short documentary, even after this comprehensive crackdown, is a tribute to the protest movement’s enduring power.

“It was the biggest revolt against Beijing, and the political leadership [there] in a very long time,” Hammer said. “I think that the [Chinese leadership] is very afraid that this could spread in some way and that you would see similar actions being taken in mainland China … the fear that someone will be inspired to try to do the same.”

The star of the film, if that is the right word for a documentary about a grassroots protest movement that deliberately eschewed leader figures, is Joey Siu. She talks eloquently about how she became an accidental student activist, setting aside plans to teach as the fight for her city’s future became more urgent.

Most of the young protesters on the frontlines chose to stay anonymous over fears of retaliation that have proved well founded. Siu decided to go public, and continue to speak out, at huge personal cost.

“Ever since 2019, when I first went public [with my identity], I have been receiving a lot of harassment … and my personal information, or even information about my family members have been posted and circulated online,” she said.

The video that ends the film is the last one Siu recorded in Hong Kong. She realised she was being followed, and watched friends arrested – some as they tried to flee – and soon after decided to leave for the US.

Yet somehow, like others in the movement, she clings to hope that while they may have lost the battle for Hong Kong, they still have a chance in the long-term war for democracy.

“We understand that the situation in Hong Kong is not going to become any better, we’re pretty sure that the Chinese Communist party is not planning to restore any kinds of freedom or rights that we used to enjoy,” Siu said.

“But we are very determined to explore other possibilities to sustain the struggle.” The new focus includes lobbying for political support, organising protests where that is still possible – beyond China’s borders – and building solidarity.

The name of the documentary is taken from a protest motto, emphasising the need for unity in the face of pressure from Beijing. That commitment endures, and she is grateful that a film she took part in to document their struggle, is now also helping support it.

“All of us understand that this is going to be a very long and very difficult battle so we are trying our very best to sustain the momentum that we built in 2019,” she said.

“The Oscar nomination has galvanised a lot of attention from people across the globe, who might not have been paying attention to what has been going on in Hong Kong.”",827,4863,7,64

Romania's centrist government on Thursday approved a United States-backed bill that effectively bars China and Huawei (HWT.UL) from taking part in development of its 5G network, a member of the IT&C and National Security Committee told Reuters.

Europe has emerged as a battleground in the technology 'Cold War' playing out between China and Washington and Huawei's European competitors, Ericsson (ERICb.ST) and Nokia (NOKIA.HE), could become a supplier duopoly should the Chinese company be shut out.

""The government just approved this bill of paramount importance for Romania, sealing a 2019 memorandum signed in Washington, meaning that China and Huawei are ruled out from any would-be partnership on 5G with the Romanian state,"" Pavel Popescu said.

Under the memorandum, the two governments said in August 2019 that: ""as part of risk-based security approach, careful and complete evaluation of 5G vendors is necessary.""

Romania was a staunch Washington ally even before it joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 2004. Washington sees Huawei as an arm of China's Communist Party's global surveillance machinery.

Huawei, which is playing a leading role as the telecoms world gears up for next generation wireless technology, has repeatedly denied spying for the Chinese state.

In a pioneering and controversial experiment, scientists successfully created just such a hybrid: a chimeric combination of monkey and human cells, existing together in a living embryo that otherwise would never have been conceived by nature alone.

Ethically fraught science? Yes. Mad science? No.

While research into human-animal hybrids has a long and questionable history, in recent years researchers have pursued chimeric organisms to probe questions of biology that stand to offer significant gains in fields such as regenerative medicine.

For example, if we were somehow able to master growing human organs in pig tissue, it might go a long way to solving the huge organ shortage that costs human lives everyday.

To that end, a team led by gene expression expert Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte from the Salk Institute in California made headlines in 2017, creating the first pig-human hybrid embryo, with a view to one day being able to produce transplantable human organs from the animals.

As it happened, much like in similar experiments with sheep-human hybrids, the amount of successfully integrated human cells was very low, suggesting certain incompatibilities between the pig and human biology at a molecular level.

To try again with something a little closer to home, Izpisua Belmonte – together with a team led by primate reproduction biologist Weizhi Ji from the Kunming University of Science and Technology in China – conducted new experiments with macaque monkey (Macaca fascicularis) embryos, injecting them with human stem cells, to gauge how these distant-but-related animal cells might coexist as one.

In each of the monkey blastocysts studied, 25 human extended pluripotent stem cells (hEPSCs) were injected – a form of stem cell with the ability to contribute to both the embryo and the surrounding tissues that will support its development.

Using fluorescent tagging, the researchers were able to see that the human cells had successfully integrated in 132 of the macaque embryos, and after 10 days, 103 of the chimeric embryos were still alive and developing.

However, the survival rate began to diminish, and by day 19, only three chimeras were still alive, at which point all the hybrid embryos were terminated in line with the experimental parameters. The results overall showed a more successful integration than the pig-human chimera of 2017.

In addition, genetic sequencing of the blastocyst cells via a technique called transcriptome analysis revealed new clues about cellular communication inside the hybrids, which could greatly expand our understanding of how to make part-human chimeras succeed.

""From these analyses, several communication pathways that were either novel or strengthened in the chimeric cells were identified,"" Izpisua Belmonte says.

""Understanding which pathways are involved in chimeric cell communication will allow us to possibly enhance this communication and increase the efficiency of chimerism in a host species that's more evolutionarily distant to humans.""

Be that as it may, this kind of research makes many in the scientific community uneasy, meddling with both human life and concepts of animal welfare in ways that some consider either unethical or uncomfortably borderline.

While Izpisua Belmonte and his team emphasize that the research was conducted with the ""utmost attention to ethical considerations and by coordinating closely with regulatory agencies"", some have suggested these particular experiments may have been conducted in China to get around legal issues that might have prevented the work elsewhere.

""We are doing the experiments with monkeys in China because, in principle, they cannot be done here because of lack of infrastructure,"" one of the study authors, developmental biologist Estrella Núñez Delicado from Spain's Universidad Catolica San Antonio de Murcia told Spanish newspaper El Pais in 2019 when news of the study first broke.

In this case, all the embryos were destroyed within 20 days of their creation, but questions swirl around what would happen if such embryonic organisms were let to live longer, potentially developing the rudiments of a nervous system, or even aspects of consciousness or emotions.

Philosophical questions are not new in science, but such is the pace of development in research like this, that each successive advancement throws up fresh uncertainties and scientific possibilities that often haven't been considered before.

""New research often pushes up against the limits of existing thinking about ethics; this research is no exception,"" ethicists Henry T. Greely and Nita A. Farahan explain in a commentary published alongside the study.

""While human/non-human chimeras involving living or fetal animals have been discussed for nearly 20 years, little to no ethical discussion has focused on putting human cells into non-human blastocysts (let alone non-human primate blastocysts).""

Navalny's right-hand man Leonid Volkov says a massive rally is planned on Wednesday evening ""not just about Kremlin critic's freedom, but his life"" after his doctors said he could die any minute as his health deteriorates rapidly in prison.

This February 20, 2021 file photo shows Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny attends a court hearing in Moscow, Russia. (Reuters)

The team of jailed Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny called for massive protests across Russia next week to help save the life of the hunger-striking opposition leader, who doctors warn could die in a matter of days.

Navalny is President Vladimir Putin's most prominent opponent and the street protests are to be held just hours after the Kremlin chief is set to deliver his long-awaited state of nation address on Wednesday.

""It's to time to act. We are talking not just about Navalny's freedom but his life,"" Navalny's right-hand man Leonid Volkov said on Facebook.

Volkov said Wednesday's rally, set for 7PM local time, could become a decisive battle against ""absolute evil"" or Russia's last opposition rally for years to come.

""Call on all your acquaintances and take to central squares,"" wrote Volkov, who heads Navalny's regional offices, adding that the protests should be massive.

""Don't think that nothing depends on us.""

Authorities have ramped up pressure on Navalny's supporters in recent months, detaining more than 10,000 protesters at opposition demonstrations in January and February.

US warns of 'consequences'

The 44-year-old Russian began a hunger strike on March 31 to demand proper medical treatment for back pain and numbness in his legs and hands.

On Saturday, Navalny's doctors said his health had rapidly deteriorated and demanded prison officials grant them immediate access.

""Our patient can die any minute,"" cardiologist Yaroslav Ashikhmin said, pointing to Navalny's high potassium levels and saying he should be moved to intensive care.

Both France and Germany on Sunday joined a growing international chorus of protest at Navalny's treatment.

US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan warned on Sunday that Russia will face ""consequences"" if Navalny dies.

""In terms of the specific measures we would undertake, we are looking at a variety of different costs that we would impose, and I'm not going to telegraph that publicly at this point,"" Sullivan told CNN.

""But we have communicated that there will be consequences if Mr. Navalny dies.""

Sullivan said the White House had told the Kremlin that Moscow would be ""held accountable by the international community"" for what happens to Navalny while in Russian custody.

EU to discuss Navalny situation on Monday

EU foreign ministers will discuss the case of Navalny when they hold talks on Monday, Germany said.

""At tomorrow's Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels, EU foreign ministers will also address Navalny's situation,"" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told Bild newspaper on Sunday.

Earlier, his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian also said the bloc was watching Navalny's situation closely, as he warned of possible further sanctions against Russia.

""We have already taken action,"" the French minister said, referring to EU sanctions.

""The package of sanctions is already significant, but there may be others,"" warned Le Drian.

Maas also demanded that Russian authorities give Navalny swift access to proper medical care.

""We urgently demand that Alexey Navalny receive adequate medical treatment and access to doctors he trusts,"" Maas told Bild.

""His right to medical care must be granted without delay.""

Navalny, Putin's most prominent opponent, was arrested in January on returning to Russia from Berlin after recovering from a near-fatal poisoning attack he says was orchestrated by the Kremlin.

Moscow denies the allegation.

He is serving two-and-a-half years on old embezzlement charges, which he says are politically motivated, in a penal colony in the town of Pokrov around 100 kilometres (60 miles) east of Moscow.

Hopefully, we can make it to the inauguration before people start asking questions. We just have a lot on our plate right now, and honestly, this is the last thing we want to deal with.” At press time, Schumer was ruminating on whether he should at least tell Biden’s family.

“Amendments to the preamble of CEPA will recognize the need to reduce reliance on animal testing when assessing the risks that substances may pose on human health and the environment,” Environment and Climate Change Canada said in a statement published Tuesday.

“These amendments will encourage federal government departments to promote the development and timely use of alternative methods and strategies, as science permits.”

The changes follow a relentless lobbying campaign by animal activists and animal rights organizations, including Animal Justice, Humane Canada, and the Society for Humane Science.

“Countless animals are subjected to painful and unnecessary toxicity tests every year in Canada,” Kaitlyn Mitchell, staff lawyer with Animal Justice, said in a written statement.

“Animal Justice applauds the government’s commitment to reducing reliance on outdated and unreliable animal toxicity testing models.

“Canada should ultimately eliminate these painful experiments entirely, while supporting research into alternative models that are safer, more reliable, and cruelty-free.”

Activists say about 90,000 animals are used in toxicity tests annually.

And, they say, many of the tests fall into “Category E” the most severe category of harm that animals can experience, according to the Canadian Council on Animal Care.

“Category E tests cause death, severe pain, and extreme distress and may include procedures such as inflicting burns or trauma on unanesthetized animals, and forced ingestion or topical application of deadly substances,” Animal Justice said in a statement.

The groups are also calling on the federal government to fund the Canadian Centre for Alternatives to Animal Methods (CCAAM) at the University of Windsor.

“CCAAM is the first centre of its kind in Canada, dedicated to developing and validating animal-free research innovations such as cultured tissues, computer models, and organs-on-a-chip,” said Animal Justice.",324,2232,11,79

Concern is mounting that the long-simmering conflict in east Ukraine could spiral back into wider fighting after reports of major Russian troop movements and an intensification of clashes with Moscow-backed separatists.

The troop build-up along Ukraine's northern and eastern borders, as well as on the Crimean peninsula annexed by Moscow in 2014, comes amid a spike in violence along the front line between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces in the east of the country.

Zelensky is expected to travel to Paris on Friday to discuss the rising tensions with French President Emmanuel Macron.

The two leaders will be joined by German Chancellor Angela Merkel by video link, Macron's office said.

Ahead of the trip Zelensky urged NATO and the European Union to speed up Ukaine's membership process.

""We cannot stay indefinitely in the EU and NATO waiting room,"" the Ukrainian leader told the French daily Le Figaro.

""The time has come to step up a gear, to invite us to join the EU and NATO,"" he added, denouncing Russia's ""violent aggression"" against his country, in comments run on the newspaper's French language website.

The foreign ministers of EU members Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania arrived in Kiev on Thursday and European Council President Charles Michel spoke with the Ukrainian leader in a show of support.

Speaking alongside the visiting diplomats, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told reporters that rhetoric in Moscow had reached a fever pitch with pundits and officials issuing ""dehumanising"" statements aimed at intimidating Kiev.

""They are openly threatening Ukraine with war and the destruction of Ukrainian statehood,"" Kuleba said.

""The red line of Ukraine is the state border. If Russia crosses the red line, then it will have to suffer,"" Kuleba said in English.

Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told reporters: ""Ukraine will never be on its own.""

The United States has reiterated its backing and on Thursday European Council President Michel ""conveyed the EU's unwavering support"" in phone talks with Zelensky, according to a readout of the call.

The foreign ministers of the EU will discuss Ukraine on Monday, Brussels said.

On Friday, Macron will receive Zelensky for lunch in Paris, the Elysee said.

""It's an important meeting,"" the 43-year-old Ukrainian leader said after a meeting of the country's security council. He said the situation in the east was ""under control.""

""The army is ready, that's the most important thing,"" he added.

Together with Russia, France, Germany and Ukraine form the Normandy format of countries that have sought and failed to resolve the conflict since 2015.

On Wednesday, US President Joe Biden and Merkel agreed to call on Russia to reduce its troops on the border with Ukraine.

Russia dismissed the pressure.

Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that Western countries including Germany and France should ""stop participating in the propaganda campaign surrounding Russian activity on Russian territory that does not threaten anybody"".

Kuleba's warning on Russia came after international observers to the conflict said late Wednesday that there had been a dramatic increase in recent violations that was hindering their work.

""The number of violations recorded over the past two weeks has reached its highest level this year,"" monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe said in a statement.

An uptick in fighting since the start of the year has seen Moscow and Kiev blame each other for the rise in violence between government forces and separatists in eastern Ukraine.

Ukraine says the spate of clashes has cost the lives of nearly 30 Ukrainian servicemen and left at least another 68 wounded since January.

Kiev warned this week that 28,000 separatist fighters and more than 2,000 Russian military instructors and advisers are currently stationed in eastern Ukraine, while nearly 33,000 soldiers are deployed in Crimea.

Russia's defence ministry, however, said those troops were merely responding to ""threatening"" NATO actions by participating in military drills that would conclude in three weeks.

The renewed fighting has left in tatters a ceasefire brokered last July that had brought relative calm to the conflict.

""We are not afraid. Ukraine itself is strong enough and has reliable friends to defend its statehood,"" Kuleba said.",731,4697,8,57

""This is horrible, simply horrible,"" said a tearful Grete Brautig, who found the headstone of her grandfather, Waffen-SS Oberlieutenant Otto Brautig, defaced with a spray-painted Star of David. ""Why would anyone want to do such an awful, hateful thing to my grosspapa, a man who loved and fought for his country?""

According to Darmstadt police, sometime between the hours of 1 and 6 a.m., unknown persons vandalized the grave markers of dozens of prominent SS men with pro-Semitic graffiti, including Jewish stars and slogans like ""Chosen People"" and ""Next Year In Jerusalem.""

It is believed to be the worst pro-Semitic crime in Darmstadt history.

""You must understand, the Star of David is an incredibly painful symbol for my people,"" said former Hitler Youth member Conrad Steuben, 67, whose father, SS-Unterscharführer Erich Steuben, was buried with full military honors at Darmstadt in 1945. ""It stands for the destruction of us and everything we believe in. Seeing it scrawled across those gravestones reopens many deep wounds.""

""I thought we had put pro-Semitism behind us here in Darmstadt,"" Steuben said. ""But I suppose old prejudices die hard.""

Darmstadt police, working closely with the Nazi Anti-Defamation League, are committed to bringing the perpetrators to justice.

""This sort of hate crime must not be tolerated,"" police chief Klaus Meine said. ""We will do everything in our power to find the Jews responsible for this.""

The vandalism is not the first incident of pro-Semitism to occur in Darmstadt. In 1991, a group of Zionists marched through the streets of the city, waving Israeli flags and chanting in Hebrew. City leaders filed a court injunction in an effort to block the march, but the Zionists, defended by the German Civil Liberties Union, won.

""I will never forgive the GCLU for defending the Zionists,"" Steuben said. ""I am all for free speech, but that crossed the line.""

Support for the people of Darmstadt has poured in from across Germany in the form of letters, donations and personal visits from political figures.

""Once more, Germans have become the victims of hatred, prejudice and intolerance,"" said former Austrian president Kurt Waldheim in a speech given in the Darmstadt town plaza. ""This incident serves as a reminder that we must remain vigilant about preserving the memory of the four million Germans who died during World War II, so that similar tragedies can be prevented in the future.

It’s just common sense. Besides, most of these people already hate her, so what’s there to worry about?” The governors also stressed that it would also really help them out if she told their state’s proteste rs and police departments to chill out, too.

0,Bill Gates Impeded Global Access Covid Vaccines,https://newrepublic.com/article/162000/bill-gates-impeded-global-access-covid-vaccines,"His latest move is to institutionalize the ACT-Accelerator as the central organizing institution in future pandemics. The shortages have made this effort a little awkward, however, and Gates is now forced to reckon with the question of technology transfer. This is an aspect of the equitable access debate that doesn’t concern intellectual property as commonly perceived—as a simple matter of patents and licenses—but access to the components and technical knowledge related to practical manufacture, including biological material and other areas otherwise protected under the category of intellectual property known as trade secrets. The global south and civil society groups have been calling for tech transfer for months—either mandatory tech transfer that could have been written into contracts or through a voluntary mechanism associated with C-TAP—but Gates has predictably arrived on the scene with a more familiar plan in hand.

In early March, senior Gates staff joined pharma executives for a “Global C19 Vaccine Supply Chain and Manufacturing Summit” convened by Chatham House in London. The main agenda item: plans for a new arm within the ACT-Accelerator, the Covid Vaccine Capacity Connector, that seeks to address the tech-transfer question within the usual frame of monopoly rights and bilateral licensing.

“The tech transfer debate is being decisively seized and shaped by those who want to set the terms and conditions under which knowledge can be transferred,” writes Priti Patnaik in her Geneva Health Files newsletter. A Gates-directed tech-transfer mechanism without meaningful input from WHO members states, she writes, would be a “body blow” to C-TAP and similar future initiatives that promote open licensing and knowledge sharing to maximize production and access.

There are signs of overdue scrutiny of Gates’s role in public health and lifelong commitment to exclusive intellectual property rights. But so far these are blips. More common is the deference on display in a March 21 New York Times article about the U.S. government’s role in developing the mRNA vaccines now under the monopoly control of Moderna and Pfizer. When the piece turned to Gates’s inevitable cameo, the Times reporter was hovering right over the target—and somehow managed to miss wide by a mile. Instead of probing Gates’s central role in preserving this paradigm, the paper linked to gentle boilerplate about pricing and access found on the Gates Foundation website. In response to a request for comment, a Gates Foundation spokesperson pointed me to a piece by its CEO, Mark Suzman, arguing that “IP fundamentally underpins innovation, including the work that has helped create vaccines so quickly.”

Any change in media coverage of Gates’s second career may produce a delayed echo within the world he has come to dominate. Here Gates not only controls the narratives, he controls most of the payroll. This may sound conspiratorial or overblown to outsiders but not to campaigners who have witnessed Gates’s ability to shift gravity on major issues.

“If you said to an ordinary person, ‘We’re in a pandemic. Let’s figure out everyone who can make vaccines and give them everything they need to get online as fast as possible,’ it would be a no-brainer,” says James Love. “But Gates won’t go there. Neither will the people dependent on his funding. He has immense power. He can get you fired from a U.N. job. He knows that if you want to work in global public health, you’d better not make an enemy of the Gates Foundation by questioning its positions on I.P. and monopolies. And there are a lot of advantages to being on his team. It’s a sweet, comfortable ride for a lot of people.”

*Among journalists echoing this argument was former New Republic editor Andrew Sullivan. When The New York Times reported Sullivan was defending the companies’ lawsuit while taking undisclosed funding from PhRma, the industry trade association, Sullivan remained defiant in the face of evidence-based accusations that he was an unethical journalist. “It behooves me to say I see absolutely no problems with [drug industry sponsorship],” he told Salon. “In fact, I am extremely proud to get some support from a great industry.” It later turned out that Africans adhered more closely to the twice-daily pill regimens than patient populations in rich countries.



**In 2010, the Gates Foundation would bankroll a documentary advocating the privatization of U.S. public education, titled Waiting for Superman.

While past trailers for The Last of Us Part II made it look like it would be a genre-defining interactive experience that expanded on everything that made the original great, Naughty Dog revealed today that they spent so much time crafting the game’s incredible plot and cinematics that the actual gameplay will just consist of a simple word puzzle mini-game.



Advertisement

We’ll admit it: This is a legitimate letdown.



“Unfortunately, we spent the past five years so intent on topping the original Last Of Us’s storytelling that we spent our entire budget on motion capture and just forgot to include any interactivity until about three days ago,” said director Neil Druckmann, who told OGN he had spent the past 72 stress-inducing hours rushing to code a word puzzle game as a stand-in for any gaming element. “It’s kind of a blend of crossword puzzles and sudoku. There’s a point system and our graphics guy threw together a nice icon to show Joel’s face, but that’s about all we had time for.”



“Look, we’re really sorry about this,” he continued.



In our short hands-on with the game, we got to see a gut-wrenching confessional scene where Ellie opens up to a potential romantic interest about the devastating experience of surviving in a ruined world, before abruptly taking a dog-eared collection of word games from her back pocket and saying, “Hey, these are fun. Let’s play.” From there, we were launched into the gameplay, where Ellie’s static avatar glided onscreen and we were prompted to fill out a grid with a short hint about words like “smallest state in the union” or “fungus that destroed world [sic].”



Frankly, we wish we had better news, readers, but this was not the polished release we were looking for.



“Between the 15 puzzles and some special themes like ‘Underwater Exploration’ or ‘Classic Tinseltown Stars,’ we have some decent variety in there,” explained Druckmann, before admitting that the experience would still likely underwhelm anyone expecting an edge-of-your-seat adventure that featured Ellie fighting her way through a post-apocalyptic America. “The game’s dictionary is pretty limited, unfortunately, because we just didn’t budget any time or manpower to honing this experience. So, a lot of answers won’t register as real words even though they are.”

“Now, we managed to throw a lot of references to word searches into the cutscenes, which certainly helps explain why the characters keep playing this weird little crossword game, but I understand if anyone is disappointed,” he said.



So yeah, gamers. This might not be the awesome survival-horror game we were eagerly awaiting all these years, but after watching so many amazing cutscenes, we’re still holding out hope The Last of Us Part II will top plenty of Game Of The Year lists, including ours!

How naive do you think I am? And I guarantee you that the recollections I do have of storming the Capitol are because Bill Gates used one of his 5G satellites to pump fake memories into my brain.” Keleher also reportedly told investigators that if he had been at the Capitol, he would have assuredly been there as part of some false-flag operation, in which case there was no question in his mind that he was secretly an FBI operative.

Following a string of undercover exposés into how CNN injects bias into narratives, Twitter has suspended Project Veritas’s founder, James O’Keefe.

Project Veritas has, for several years, been releasing exclusive undercover video footage that exposes the biases of TV networks, the media, and Big Tech.

The Project Veritas account had already been suspended by Twitter earlier this year for a video confronting Facebook’s Vice President of Integrity about political bias the platform had been partaking in. Twitter said the confrontation video showed “private information.”

The censorship of Veritas was brought up in congressional hearings about Big Tech’s legal liabilities and shields in March.

While Project Veritas had already been banned, the account of O’Keefe was still available on the platform – until today, the same day an explosive exposé on CNN continued to trend on Twitter.

The undercover CNN videos covered CNN refusing to report on information that went counter to the narrative it wanted to convey, as well as the way in which CNN had amped up the coronavirus fears to increase viewership and engagement.

“Look what we did, we [CNN] got Trump out. I am 100 percent going to say it, and I 100 percent believe that if it wasn’t for CNN, I don’t know that Trump would have got voted out…I came to CNN because I wanted to be a part of that,” CNN’s Technical Director Charlie Chester was caught saying in the trending video.

O’Keefe told Fox News, “It’s probably the biggest story by implication. What it represents – this guy, a director at CNN…he’s admitting the network is propaganda. He says they were trying to get Trump out without admitting that’s what they were doing and saw me confront him about that. I just want them to be honest, he’s not being honest.”

In a statement about the sudden ban, a Twitter spokesperson said O’Keefe had been banned due to their “platform manipulation and spam” policy. “…you can’t mislead others on Twitter by operating fake accounts,” and “you can’t artificially amplify or disrupt conversations through the use of multiple accounts.”

It’s unclear what Twitter is referring to.

Twitter sent O’Keefe a similar message:

On Telegram, O’Keefe said he was suing Twitter. “I am suing Twitter for defamation because they said I, James O’Keefe, ‘operated fake accounts.’ This is false, this is defamatory, and they will pay,” he said.

Project Veritas has a long history with Twitter. In the past, Veritas leaked undercover information about a Twitter’s engineer’s bias from inside the company, as well as an internal conference call of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.

While the age of consent was previously 15, prosecutors in France used to be required to prove sex was non-consensual to obtain a rape conviction.

For all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app.

""This is an historic law for our children and our society,"" Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti told the National Assembly.

""No adult aggressor will be able to claim the consent of a minor younger than 15-years-old.""

The vote in favouor of the bill was unanimous at its final reading, the Assembly said on Twitter.

There had been concerns from some lawmakers that an age of consent below which sex automatically constituted rape might criminalise a consensual sexual relationship between a minor and a person only a few years older.

As a consequence, a ""Romeo and Juliet"" clause that allows for sexual relations between a minor and an individual up to five years older. The clause will not apply in cases of sexual assault.

The legislation also considers incestuous sex with a minor under 18 to be rape.

In a country that has long cherished its self-image as the land of seduction and romance, sexual abuse against women and children for years went undetected or undeclared in the upper echelons of power and within celebrity circles.

But there has been much soul-searching in recent years.

The #MeToo movement that swept around the world after numerous women in 2017 accused U.S. movie producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault proved a turning point in France. So too did the fall from grace in 2020 of a French writer who had written openly about his pedophilia.

France had already toughened its sex crimes laws in 2018 when it outlawed sexual harassment on the streets, leaving cat-callers and aggressively lecherous individuals facing potential on-the-spot fines.

Two Russian warships transited the Bosphorus en route to the Black Sea on Saturday and 15 smaller vessels completed a transfer to the sea as Moscow beefs up its naval presence at a time of tense relations with the West and Ukraine.

The reinforcement coincides with a huge build-up of Russian troops near Ukraine, something Moscow calls a temporary defensive exercise, and follows an escalation in fighting in eastern Ukraine between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian government forces.

Russia's relations with Washington, which cancelled the deployment of two of its own warships to the Black Sea last week after fierce Russian protests, are at a post-Cold war low.

Moscow expelled 10 U.S. diplomats on Friday in retaliation for the expulsion of the same number of Russian diplomats from the United States over alleged malign activity.

Russia has also temporarily restricted the movement of foreign warships “and other state ships” near Crimea, which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014, a move condemned by both Kyiv and Washington.

Two Russian Ropucha-class landing ships from Russia's Northern Fleet, capable of carrying tanks and of delivering armour and troops during coastal assaults, transited the Bosphorus on Saturday, a Reuters reporter in Istanbul saw.

More Russian naval reinforcements in the form of two more landing ships, this time from Russia's Baltic Fleet, are expected to imminently transit the Bosphorus.

The RIA news agency on Saturday also reported that 15 smaller vessels from Russia's Caspian Flotilla have completed their transfer to the Black Sea as part of an exercise.

In a further sign of heightened tensions in the region, a ship carrying logistics trucks and equipment for NATO forces in Romania transited the Bosphorus on Friday evening, the same Reuters reporter saw.

0,Colorful Coffins Lighten Mood at New Zealand Funerals,https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/colorful-coffins-lighten-mood-new-zealand-funerals,"WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND - When the pallbearers brought Phil McLean's coffin into the chapel, there were gasps before a wave of laughter rippled through the hundreds of mourners.

The coffin was a giant cream doughnut.

""It overshadowed the sadness and the hard times in the last few weeks,"" said his widow, Debra. ""The final memory in everyone's mind was of that doughnut, and Phil's sense of humor.""

The doughnut was the latest creation by Phil's cousin Ross Hall, who runs a business in Auckland, New Zealand, called Dying Art, which custom builds colorful coffins.

Other creations by Hall include a sailboat, a firetruck, a chocolate bar and Lego blocks. There have been glittering coffins covered in fake jewels, a casket inspired by the movie The Matrix, and plenty of coffins depicting people's favorite beaches and holiday spots.

""There are people who are happy with a brown mahogany box and that's great,"" said Hall. ""But if they want to shout it out, I'm here to do it for them.""

The idea first came to Hall about 15 years ago when he was writing a will and contemplating his own death.

""How do I want to go out?"" he thought to himself, deciding it wouldn't be like everyone else. ""So I put in my will that I want a red box with flames on it.""

Six months later, Hall, whose other business is a signage and graphics company, decided to get serious. He approached a few funeral directors who looked at him with interest and skepticism. But over time, the idea took hold.

Hall begins with special-made blank coffins and uses fiberboard and plywood to add details. A latex digital printer is used for the designs. Some orders are particularly complex, like the sailboat, which included a keel and rudder, cabin, sails, even metal railings and pulleys.

This photo provided by Ross Hall, shows caskets shaped as Lego and a space ship in Auckland, New Zealand, on Feb 25, 2021. (Ross Hall via AP)

Depending on the design, the coffins retail for between about 3,000 and 7,500 New Zealand dollars ($2,100 and $5,400).

Hall said the tone of funerals has changed markedly over recent years.

""People now think it's a celebration of life rather than a mourning of death,"" he said. And they've been willing to throw out stuffy conventions in favor of getting something unique.

But a doughnut?

Debra McLean said she and her late husband, who was 68 when he died in February, used to tour the country in their motorhome, and Phil loved comparing cream doughnuts in every small town, considering himself something of a connoisseur.

He considered a good doughnut one that was crunchy on the outside, airy in the middle, and definitely made with fresh cream.

This photo provided by Ross Hall shows a cream doughnut-shaped coffin for the funeral of Phil McLean outside a church in Tauranga, New Zealand, on Feb 17, 2021. (Ross Hall via AP)

After Phil was diagnosed with bowel cancer, he had time to think about his funeral and, along with his wife and cousin, came up with the idea for the doughnut coffin. Debra said they even had 150 doughnuts delivered to the funeral in Tauranga from Phil's favorite bakery in Whitianga, more than 160 kilometers away.

Hall said his coffins are biodegradable and are usually buried or cremated along with the deceased. The only one he's ever gotten back is his cousin's, he said, because he used polystyrene and shaping foam, which is not environmentally friendly.

Phil was switched to a plain coffin for his cremation, and Hall said he'll keep the doughnut coffin forever. For now, it remains in the back of his white 1991 Cadillac hearse.

As for his own funeral? Hall said he's changed his mind about those red flames. He's emailed his kids saying he wants to be buried in a clear coffin wearing nothing but a leopard-pattern G-string.

""The kids say they're not going,"" he said with a laugh.",664,3839,8,53

These fragments of wilderness undamaged by human activities are mainly in parts of the Amazon and Congo tropical forests, east Siberian and northern Canadian forests and tundra, and the Sahara. Invasive alien species including cats, foxes, rabbits, goats and camels have had a major impact on native species in Australia, with the study finding no intact areas left.

The researchers suggest reintroducing a small number of important species to some damaged areas, such as elephants or wolves – a move that could restore up to 20% of the world’s land to ecological intactness.

Q&A What are the five biggest threats to biodiversity? Show According to the UN’s Convention on Biological Diversity there are five main threats to biodiversity. In descending order these are; changes in land and sea use; direct exploitation of organisms; climate change; pollution and invasive species. Converting wild spaces into agricultural land and the intensification of farming practices is causing the greatest destruction. Between 2010 and 2015, 3.3m hectares (8.1m acres) of forest disappeared, with no sign of rates slowing down. Predictions suggest agricultural land could increase by 18% by 2050, further removing the land available to nature. As agriculture intensifies, things like wetlands, scrubland and woodlands – which wildlife relies on – are ironed out from the landscape. In marine environments, overfishing is considered to be the most serious driver of biodiversity loss. One quarter of the world’s commercial fisheries are overexploited, according to a 2005 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. Harvesting of wood, keeping livestock in high densities and water abstraction are also all negatively affecting ecosystems through overexploitation of natural resources. Climate change is dismantling ecosystems at every level. Extreme weather events such as tropical storms and flooding are destroying habitats. Warmer temperatures are also changing the timing of natural events – such as the availability of insects and when birds hatch their eggs in spring. The distribution of species and their range is also changing – mountain species are particularly vulnerable because they have little opportunities to move as temperatures warm. In marine environments, pollution from agricultural runoff (mainly nitrogen and phosphorus) is a huge problem. When these chemicals leak into the wider environment they change ecosystems by increasing the nutrient-value – this means fast-growing species that like high-nutrient environments outcompete slower growing species that favour nutrient-poor environments. Agricultural runoff causes toxic algal blooms and even ""dead zones"" in the worst-affected areas. Since the 17th century, invasive species have contributed to 40% of all known animal extinctions. Invasive species change the composition of ecosystems by outcompeting native species. With increased travel and tourism, there is a higher risk of species hitchhiking to new areas. For example, invasive earthworms carried in the treads of hiking boots are believed to be changing Arctic ecosystems.

Previous analyses have identified wilderness areas based largely on satellite images and estimated that 20-40% of the Earth’s surface is little affected by humans. However, the scientists behind the new study argue that forests, savannah and tundra can appear intact from above but that, on the ground, vital species are missing. Elephants, for example, spread seeds and create important clearings in forests, while wolves can control populations of deer and elk.

The new assessment combines maps of human damage to habitat with maps showing where animals have disappeared from their original ranges or are too few in number to maintain a healthy ecosystem. Some scientists said the new analysis underestimates the intact areas, because the ranges of animals centuries ago are poorly known and the new maps do not take account of the impacts of the climate crisis, which is changing the ranges of species.

It is widely accepted that the world is in a biodiversity crisis, with many wildlife populations – from lions to insects – plunging, mainly due to the destruction of habitat for farming and building. Some scientists think a sixth mass extinction of life on Earth is beginning, with serious consequences for the food, and clean water and air that humanity depends upon.

“Much of what we consider as intact habitat is missing species that have been hunted [and poached] by people, or lost because of invasive species or disease,” said Dr Andrew Plumptre, the lead author of the study, from the Key Biodiversity Areas Secretariat in Cambridge, UK. “It’s fairly scary, because it shows how unique places like the Serengeti are, which actually have functioning and fully intact ecosystems.

“We’re in the UN decade of ecosystem restoration now, but it is focusing on degraded habitat,” he said. “Let’s also think about restoring species so that we can try and build up these areas where we’ve got ecologically intact ecosystems.”

The research, published in the journal Frontiers in Forests and Global Change, used maps of the ranges of 7,000 species in 1,500 and today from the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List. Most of the data was for mammals, but it also included some birds, fish, plants, reptiles and amphibians. Many of the intact areas identified were in territories managed by indigenous communities. The analysis did not include Antarctica.

“It might be possible to increase the ecological intact area back to up to 20% through the targeted reintroductions of species that have been lost in areas where human impact is still low, provided the threats to their survival can be addressed,” said Plumptre. He cited the successful reintroduction of wolves into Yellowstone national park in the US, which transformed the ecosystem.

Prof Pierre Ibisch, at the Eberswalde University for Sustainable Development in Germany and not part of the study, said finding just 3% of land was intact was “predictably devastating”. He said: “We need to give nature significantly more space to carry us into the future, [but] I fear that the reintroduction of a few species in certain areas is not a gamechanger.”

Ibisch said the analysis did not take account of the climate crisis. “Accelerating climate change is becoming the overarching threat to the functionality of entire ecosystems. Yesterday’s mammal intactness hardly tells us a lot about the functioning ecosystems in the [global heating] age.”

Prof James Watson at the University of Queensland, Australia, said: “This study undervalues many efforts by ecosystem scientists to map and save ecologically intact places across the planet. It uses maps for species that are basically best guesses, meaning the message of where ecosystems are actually still pretty much intact is clearly minimised.”

Plumptre acknowledged that the species range maps were relatively crude and said the 3% figure was a “ballpark estimate”. He said: “The trouble is, at the moment, we don’t have any other maps.” Scientists should next focus on specific regions and use more detailed human impact data and species data to identify ecologically intact sites, he said.

In January, more than 50 countries committed to protect almost a third of the planet by 2030 to halt the destruction of the natural world. “Putting efforts into conserving these [intact] places is very important,” Plumptre said. “They are so rare and special, and show what the world was like before humans had any major impact, helping us measure how much we’ve lost.”",1205,7742,11,70

0,One and done? Study suggests recovered Covid-19 patients may only need single vaccine dose,https://www.rt.com/news/521207-single-vaccine-dose-covid-survivors/,"Recovered Covid-19 patients showed significant antibody responses after just a single mRNA vaccine dose but apparently received little additional benefit following their second dose, promising new research has found.

Researchers led by E. John Wherry, PhD at the Penn Institute of Immunology took blood samples from 44 healthy individuals who received either the BioNTech/Pfizer or Moderna mRNA Covid-19 vaccine, both of which employ mRNA technology, 11 of whom had a prior Covid-19 infections.

Blood samples were taken at four stages both before and after receipt of the vaccines and the researchers noted something peculiar in the results; the Covid-free vaccine recipients, called Covid naïve, did not boast a full immune response until after their second dose but curiously, those previously-infected showed nearly full immune response after just one dose.

“These results are encouraging for both short- and long-term vaccine efficacy, and this adds to our understanding of the mRNA vaccine immune response through the analysis of memory B cells,” said senior author Wherry.

Response to vaccines in humans is twofold: rapid response in the form of antibodies, and longer-term immunity, courtesy of memory B cells, which profile intruders so the immune system knows to fight them off if they ever show up again in the future.

This latest study highlights differences in memory B cell responses in recovered Covid-19 patients as compared to the Covid naive.

“Memory B cells are a strong predictor of future antibody responses,” Wherry explained, adding that proper monitoring of memory B cell responses will play an important role in longer-term pandemic response and management, especially in the face of new mutations and variants.

The results suggest that only a single dose of the mRNA vaccines may be required to give recovered patients the necessary protection by triggering a maximal immune response from both antibodies and memory B cells, potentially freeing up supplies at some point in the future, amid a worldwide crunch.

The researchers noted that two doses were required to achieve full immune response among the covid-naive patients and this held true in analysis of antibodies against different variants of the coronavirus.

“Everyone has good responses to the vaccines. They work to protect people against Covid-19. But for those who may be worried about side effects, they are not necessarily a bad thing–they may actually be an indicator of an even better immune response,” Wherry said.

Larger-scale studies are continuing with a view to determining the best course of action in terms of dosage numbers, overall immune response and lasting efficacy over time.

Moscow deployed two warships through the Bosphorus on Saturday and is sending additional smaller ships from its Caspian and Baltic fleets all aimed at bolstering its presence in the Black Sea, according to Reuters and Russian media reports.

The movements come on top of Russia’s massive troop build-up along its border with Ukraine in recent weeks, prompting fears of a possible invasion. Russia annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea in 2014, and skirmishes have continued at a low level along the border ever since.

Western allies have rallied behind Ukraine over Moscow’s military aggression, but have stopped short of committing to additional military aid or sanctions.

For its part, the U.K. is planning to deploy vessels to the region next month in an effort to underscore support for Kyiv, according to The Sunday Times. And last week, NATO’s Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken stood firmly with Ukraine, without indicating what steps they might take to counteract Russia’s behavior.

U.S. President Joe Biden did drop plans to send two warships into the Black Sea following protests from Russia.

In the latest flare-up between Moscow and Kyiv over the weekend, Russia’s security services on Saturday accused a Ukrainian diplomat of trying to access classified local law enforcement databases in Saint Petersburg, prompting authorities to expel the envoy.

Ukraine promptly dismissed the claims.

“We absolutely reject the accusations made against the consular officer,” a spokesman for Ukraine’s foreign ministry said in an emailed statement, adding the move shows Russia is choosing a “line of hostility.”

In response, a senior diplomat from Russia’s embassy in Kyiv has been given 72 hours from Monday to leave the country, the spokesman said.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been trying to marshal international backing as he navigates the potential crisis. In Paris on Friday, Zelenskiy called for fresh four-way talks between Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany in the so-called Normandy format to discuss the situation. Diplomatic advisers from the four countries are set to meet on Monday.

Israel and Greece have signed their biggest ever defence procurement deal, which Israel said on Sunday would strengthen political and economic ties between the countries and the two countries' air forces launched a joint exercise.

The agreement includes a $1.65 billion contract for the establishment and operation of a training centre for the Hellenic Air Force by Israeli defence contractor Elbit Systems (ESLT.TA) over a 22-year period, Israel's defence ministry said.

The training centre will be modelled on Israel's own flight academy and will be equipped with 10 M-346 training aircraft produced by Italy's Leonardo (LDOF.MI), the ministry said.

Elbit will supply kits to upgrade and operate Greece's T-6 aircraft and also provide training, simulators and logistical support.

""I am certain that (this programme) will upgrade the capabilities and strengthen the economies of Israel and Greece and thus the partnership between our two countries will deepen on the defence, economic and political levels,"" said Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz.

The announcement follows a meeting in Cyprus on Friday between the UAE, Greek, Cypriot and Israeli foreign ministers, who agreed to deepen cooperation. read more

The Israeli and Greek air forces on Sunday launched a joint exercise in Greece, the Israeli military said.

In at least one past exercise over Greece, Israeli fighter planes practised against an S-300 posted on Crete. The Russian-made air defence system is also deployed in Syria and Iran, Israel's foes.

A source in the Hellenic National Defence Command said the S-300 had not been activated in the joint exercise that began Sunday.

(IRIB via AP, File)

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran named a suspect Saturday in the attack on its Natanz nuclear facility that damaged centrifuges there, saying he had fled the country “hours before” the sabotage happened.

While the extent of the damage from the April 11 sabotage remains unclear, it comes as Iran tries to negotiate with world powers over allowing the U.S. to re-enter its tattered nuclear deal and lift the economic sanctions it faces.

Already, Iran has begun enriching uranium up to 60% purity in response — three times higher than ever before, though in small quantities. The sabotage and Iran’s response to it also have further inflamed tensions across the Mideast, where a shadow war between Tehran and Israel, the prime suspect in the sabotage, still rages.

State television named the suspect as 43-year-old Reza Karimi. It showed a passport-style photograph of a man it identified as Karimi, saying he was born in the nearby city of Kashan, Iran.

The report also aired what appeared to be an Interpol “red notice” seeking his arrest. The arrest notice was not immediately accessible on Interpol’s public-facing database. Interpol, based in Lyon, France, declined to comment.

The TV report said “necessary actions” are underway to bring Karimi back to Iran through legal channels, without elaborating. The supposed Interpol “red notice” listed his foreign travel history as including Ethiopia, Kenya, the Netherlands, Qatar, Romania, Turkey, Uganda and the United Arab Emirates.

The report did not elaborate how Karimi would have gotten access to one of the most secure facilities in the Islamic Republic. However, it did for the first time show authorities acknowledging an explosion struck the Natanz facility.

There was a “limited explosion of a small part of the electricity-feeding path to the centrifuges’ hall,” the TV report said. “The explosion happened because of the function of explosive materials and there was no cyberattack.”

Initial reports in Israeli media, which maintain close relations to its military and intelligence services, blamed a cyberattack for the damage.

The Iranian state TV report also said there were images that corroborated the account of an explosion rather than cyberattack offered by security services, but it did not broadcast those pictures.

The report also showed centrifuges in a hall, as well as what appeared to be caution tape at the Natanz facility. In one shot, a TV reporter interviewed an unnamed technician, who was shown from behind — likely a safety measure as Iranian nuclear scientists have been assassinated in suspected Israeli-orchestrated attacks in the past.

“The sound that you are hearing is the sound of operating machines that are fortunately undamaged,” he said, the high-pitched whine of the centrifuges heard in the background. “Many of the centrifuge chains that faced defects are now under control. Part of the work that had been disrupted will be back on track with the round-the-clock efforts of my colleagues.”

In Vienna, negotiations continued over the deal Saturday with another meeting of diplomats from Iran and the five powers that remain in the deal, with expert-level working groups on sanctions-lifting and nuclear issues set to continue activities through to next week.

Iran’s negotiator told state TV that the talks had entered a new phase, adding that Iran had proposed draft agreements that could be a basis for negotiation.

“We think that the talks have reached a stage where parties are able to begin to work on a joint draft,” Abbas Araghchi said. “It seems that a new understanding is taking shape, and now there is agreement over final goals.”

Enrique Mora, the European Union official who chaired the talks, tweeted that “progress has been made in a far from easy task. We need now more detailed work.”

The 2015 accord, which former President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from in 2018, prevented Iran from stockpiling enough high-enriched uranium to be able to pursue a nuclear weapon if it chose in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.

Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful, though the West and the IAEA say Tehran had an organized military nuclear program up until the end of 2003. An annual U.S. intelligence report released Tuesday maintained the longtime American assessment that Iran isn’t currently trying to build a nuclear bomb.

Iran previously had said it could use uranium enriched up to 60% for nuclear-powered ships. However, the Islamic Republic currently has no such ships in its navy.

The attack at Natanz was initially described only as a blackout in its electrical grid — but later Iranian officials began calling it an attack.

One Iranian official referred to “several thousand centrifuges damaged and destroyed” in a state TV interview. However, no other official has offered that figure and no images of the aftermath have been released.

0,Raul Castro to step down as head of Cuba’s Communist party,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/4/16/raul-castro-to-step-down-as-head-of-cubas-comminist-party,"Move marks a changing of the guard and the first time in 62 years that Cuba will not have a leader that is named Castro.

Havana, Cuba – By Monday, Cuba looks set to be without a Castro at the helm for the first time since Raúl and his brother Fidel swept down from the Sierra Maestra mountains in 1959, forcing the dictator Fulgencio Batista into exile.

One of the last surviving members of that “historic generation”, Raúl has said he will relinquish his post as the supremely powerful first secretary during the 8th Congress of the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC), which begins in Havana Friday.

The 89-year-old leaves a country queueing for food, wracked by the economic effects of coronavirus and US sanctions, and showing increasing signs of dissent.

A new song, Patria y Vida (Homeland and Life) plays off the old slogan Patria o Muerte (Homeland or Death) and can be heard in taxis and on the streets, the rap: “It’s over, it’s 62 [years] hurting.” Its message – enough is enough – infuriated the authorities enough that they responded with their own, using the original slogan. It wasn’t as popular.

And yet, Raúl leaves on his own terms, in the middle of a Congress that comes together under the banner “continuity and unity”. He leaves having initiated economic and political reforms that – until the catastrophe of coronavirus – had begun, at least according to local economists, to turn the rusting ship of state around.

Cuban President Raul Castro waves at a tribute to his brother and late former Cuban leader Fidel Castro (shown in image on wall) in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba, December 3, 2016 [File: Carlos Garcia Rawlins/Reuters] It’s widely believed he will be replaced by 60-year-old Miguel Díaz-Canel, who in 2018 succeeded him into the slightly lesser role of president.

“No one knows what is coming,” says the Cuban-born historian Ada Ferrer, author of the forthcoming Cuba: An American History. “No one knows what it will be like not to have this Castro family dynamic at the heart of Cuba after 60 years.”

Raúl Castro assumed power in 2008 as his brother Fidel’s health failed, first as president, and then in 2011 as first secretary of the communist party. Until then, he had led the army, his brother’s most loyal and trusted enforcer and advisor.

Surprisingly for a man who, in the words of Jorge Duany, director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University, “first moved to radicalise the Cuban revolution, perhaps even to influence Fidel to embrace Marxist Leninism”, he was reportedly far keener on market reforms than his brother.

As far back as the 1980s, according to defector Jesus Renzoli, Raúl’s secretary of 20 years, Raúl was pushing pro-market reforms in arguments with Fidel. Those beliefs came to fruition at the 6th party Congress in 2011, when 311 economic reforms were introduced, creating a new class of self-employed to fill the void as Raul began to shrink the state.

Raúl also said in 2011 it was time for a new generation to take the revolution forward, introducing a two-term limit for the leadership. A new constitution was drafted and voted through in 2019. At first it seemed liberalising – introducing equal marriage – before that measure was beaten back under pressure from a newly empowered church.

The inauguration of Donald Trump in 2017 undermined Raúl’s most significant achievement, a detente with the Obama administration that brought a flood of US visitors. Trump retightened the 60-year-old American sanctions, before COVID-19 finished the job, effectively ending any tourism to the island.

According to the Cuban state’s own figures, the economy shrank by 11 percent in 2020, while imports fell by 40 percent.

Cuba’s failing farms can’t feed its population of 11 million, so queues of six hours and more have formed to buy chicken, medicines and other essentials. After Cuba’s health system managed to all but keep the virus out in 2020, numbers are now rising as COVID gained a foothold over Christmas.

A woman passes by a poster displaying images of late Cuban President Fidel Castro, Cuba’s First Secretary of the Communist Party and former President Raul Castro and Cuba’s President Miguel Diaz-Canel with a sign that reads: “We are continuity,” in Havana, Cuba, April 12, 2021. [Alexandre Meneghini/Reuters] It is into this crisis that Miguel Díaz-Canel will step, if confirmed as party head. “It seems to me his position is not an enviable one, given the problems he has inherited and the challenges that have fallen on his lap,” says Michael Bustamante, author of Cuban Memory Wars.

At first sight, Díaz-Canel appears underwhelming, a departure from the Castros. While much of the rest of the world has turned to populists, Cuba will be led by a nervous-looking electrical engineer in a guayabera, a traditional men’s shirt – the epitome of a bureaucrat.

Yet those who knew him in his previous roles as regional party chief, first in his home province of Villa Clara, then in Holguin in the east, say he was witty, engaging and quick to laugh. There has been little sign of that exuberance since.

“There has been so much emphasis on continuity, on his trying to telegraph clearly to the outside world that, you know, ‘I am not Mikhail Gorbachev’, that he has not projected much of his own vision,” says Bustamante, pointing out a vision of the future is exactly what a hurting country wants.

It remains to be seen whether new ideas emerge at the April 15-18 Congress. Certainly there will be much celebration of the country having created two vaccines of its own, Soberana 2 and Abdala, both now in late-stage trials. There will be praise of Cuba’s foreign medical brigades and the work they have been doing in the world’s poorer parts.

People queue to buy chicken in the Vedado neighbourhood of Havana, Cuba, April 16, 2021 [Ruaridh Nicoll/Al Jazeera] Rafael Hernández, the Havana-based editor of social science journal Temas, says he hopes for three main changes under a new party leader: extending private business beyond mom and pop restaurants and self-employed taxi drivers, giving Cuban state industries more autonomy, and a decentralisation of power to the provinces.

“It is particularly challenging because we are in the middle of an economic crisis, a pandemic, a political transition,” he says. “But that is no reason to slow down.” I mention this to a friend who laughs at the idea that it’s possible to go slower.

Raúl Castro has made it clear, he wishes to depart with others from the historic generation. He has said allowing the leadership to age has been a mistake.

As Raul heads to his retirement in the city of Santiago, it looks like his deputy, the 90-year-old second secretary José Ramón Machado, will also head to his. As to the other octogenarians and nonagenarians in the leadership structure, their political futures are unclear.

Of course, Raúl will not be judged just on the past 10 years but on the whole sweep of the revolution. Duany points out baleful aspects – that Raúl, along with Che Guevara, was widely credited with the “execution of political enemies” at the start. He also says Raúl can be credited with the “creation of the military and police state”.

As small but significant protests continue in both Havana and Santiago, the question is whether Díaz-Canel will resort further to state security to maintain the “continuity” he espouses. As for Raúl, he made his plans clear in 2018: “I will be just another soldier defending this revolution.”",1262,7500,11,58

British warships will sail for the Black Sea in May amid rising tensions between Ukraine and Russia, the Sunday Times newspaper reported, citing senior naval sources.

The deployment is aimed at showing solidarity with Ukraine and Britain's NATO allies, the newspaper reported.

One Type 45 destroyer armed with anti-aircraft missiles and an anti-submarine Type 23 frigate will leave the Royal Navy's carrier task group in the Mediterranean and head through the Bosphorus into the Black Sea, according to the report.

RAF F-35B Lightning stealth jets and Merlin submarine-hunting helicopters will stand ready on the task group's flag ship, the carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, to support the warships in the Black Sea, the report added.

Tensions between Moscow and Kyiv have been rising amid a build-up of Russian troops along the border and clashes in eastern Ukraine between the army and pro-Russian separatists. read more

Officials at the UK Ministry of Defence were not immediately available for comment.

A ministry spokesman told the newspaper that the UK government was working closely with Ukraine to monitor the situation and continued to call on Russia to de-escalate.

""The UK and our international allies are unwavering in our support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity"", the newspaper quoted the spokesman as saying.

0,PM Imran asks Western govts to outlaw disrespect for Prophet on lines of Holocaust,https://www.dawn.com/news/1618749,"Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday asked the governments of Western countries to ""penalise those deliberately spreading their message of hate against Muslims"" by disrespecting Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in the same way that they had ""outlawed any negative comment against the Holocaust"".

In a series of tweets, Prime Minister Imran clarified that his government had only taken action against the recently proscribed Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) after members of the party ""challenged the writ of the state, used street violence and attacked the public and law enforcers"".

""No one can be above the law and the Constitution,"" he emphasised.

Addressing the ""extremists abroad who indulge in Islamophobia and racist slurs to hurt and cause pain"" to the international Muslim community, the prime minister said that Muslims ""have the greatest love and respect for our Prophet PBUH"" and cannot tolerate any disrespect and abuse.

He added that the ""extremists"" who sought to hurt Muslim sentiments by deliberately indulging in abuse and hate under the guise of freedom of speech ""clearly lack moral sense and courage"" to apologise to the 1.3 billion Muslims they hurt.

The prime minister demanded an apology from such people.

Turning to governments in the West, he called on them to ""use the same standards to penalise those deliberately spreading their message of hate against Muslims by abusing our Prophet PBUH"" as they did regarding comments made about the Holocaust.

TLP protest and ban

Earlier this week, the TLP had taken to the streets across the country especially in Punjab after its chief Saad Hussain Rizvi was detained by security forces in Lahore.

Starting on Monday, charged TLP activists blocked roads across the country, damaged public properties, clashed with police, and even held some law-enforcement personnel hostage, videos of which were widely shared on social media. Expulsion of the French ambassador to Pakistan was one of the key demands of the protesters.

The clashes saw authorities use water cannons, tear gas, and rubber bullets to hold back crowds. This was followed by the police launching a crackdown against the protesters and getting roads cleared of protest camps.

In September 2020, French magazine Charlie Hebdo had republished blasphemous sketches of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) that triggered protests across the Muslim world. In October, a history teacher who had shown blasphemous sketches of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in class was decapitated and his assailant shot dead by French police as they tried to arrest him. In the days that followed the beheading, the caricatures were projected onto the facade of a building in one French city and people displayed them at protests around the country.

Following the killing, French President Emmanuel Macron criticised Islamists and vowed not to ""give up cartoons"" depicting Prophet Muhammad. Prime Imran Khan as well as other leaders of Muslim countries had denounced the French premier's comments while countrywide protests were held calling for boycott of French products.

TLP was among the parties and groups that mounted protests in Pakistan.

Later, it called off the protests after an agreement was signed between the group and the government that stated that the government would reach a consensus in the parliament regarding the expulsion of the French ambassador within three months, would not appoint its ambassador to France and would release all the arrested workers of the TLP. The government would also not register any case against TLP leaders or workers, it stated.

In the first week of the new year, TLP threatened to relaunch its protest if the government did not fulfil its promise of expelling the French ambassador by Feb 17. However, a new agreement was signed between the party and the government in which it was decided that the latter would present the terms of the earlier agreement in the parliament before April 20.

The government then decided to arrest TLP chief Saad Hussain Rizvi as a ""pre-emptive measure"" ahead of the deadline, resulting in countrywide protests.

After the latest violent protests, the government on Thursday slapped a ban on the TLP. A notification declaring it as a proscribed organisation was issued by the Ministry of Interior shortly after the federal cabinet approved a summary to ban the party.",691,4346,14,82

0,At least 19 people killed in west Niger attack,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/18/nineteen-civilians-killed-in-new-west-niger-attack,"Governor of Tillaberi region says dozens of heavily armed attackers on motorbikes stormed the village of Gaigorou and started killing the inhabitants.

At least 19 civilians were killed when armed men raided a village in west Niger close to the border with Mali, officials have said, in the latest bloodshed in the troubled region.

The governor of Tillaberi region said dozens of heavily armed attackers on motorbikes stormed the village of Gaigorou on Saturday evening.

Governor Ibrahim Tidjani Katiella told DPA news agency the attackers, who likely came from Mali, surrounded the village and then started killing the inhabitants.

A municipal official from Dessa on Sunday confirmed that 19 people were killed and two others wounded in the attack.

He told AFP news agency that the assailants initially attacked people at a funeral, before going on to the village where they “shot at everyone they saw,” the official said.

The Tillaberi region is situated on the lawless “three-border” zone where the frontiers of Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso converge and has regularly been the target of armed groups affiliated to the ISIL (ISIS) group.

“What concerns us a lot is this escalation of violence and insecurity that is recently taking place in the region,” Katiella, the governor, said in March.

Thirteen people were killed last month when armed men on motorbikes raided the villages of Zibane-Koira Zeno, Zibane Koira-Tegui and Gadabo.

Attacks against civilians have increased since the beginning of the year – more than 300 people died in three series of attacks in western Niger.

In them the 31-year-old father relives the spine-chilling scenes he witnessed as his Covid-hit body battled for survival in a Rio ICU. The six-month-old baby who appeared to be suffocating right next to him. The man urinating blood after his kidneys failed. The unnerving bleep-bleep-bleep of machines warning doctors that yet another life was on the line.

“It was agony. When you closed your eyes – God forgive me – but it was as if you were in hell,” said Castro, a systems analyst and devout Christian who fell ill in early March as Brazil was thrust into the deadliest month of a coronavirus disaster that has killed more than 365,000 people.

“I saw everything in there. Children, adults, young people, bodybuilders – the lot. All of them going through the same thing,” Castro recalled, rubbishing the idea that only elderly people were in danger. “If you’re a human being you’re at risk,” he said. “This disease is a total game of Russian roulette.”

When Covid first hit Brazil last February it was, as elsewhere, considered mainly a threat to the ageing or infirm. A year later, as Brazil grapples with by far the most traumatic phase of its epidemic, a troubling trend has emerged, as intensive care units fill with younger patients such as Castro, some seemingly battling more severe forms of the disease. An unusually high number of infant fatalities has also been reported with more than 1,000 Brazilian babies dying last year compared with 43 in the US.

Brazilians have been particularly shocked by the case of Paulo Gustavo, a 42-year-old television star who has spent the past month fighting for his life in a Rio ICU despite being previously fit and healthy. Last week, the Brazilian Association of Intensive Care Medicine said that for the first time, most Covid patients in ICU were under 40 – a finding echoed by frontline doctors.

“We’re seeing a really big increase in young patients,” said Pedro Carvalho, a critical care doctor from the country’s northeast whose hospital’s ICUs have admitted Covid victims aged 27, 28, 29, 32, 33 and 34 in recent days. Two were women who had just given birth. The wife of the 33-year-old patient is expecting their fourth child but he is on dialysis and his chances of survival slim. “It really feels like we’re at the eye of the hurricane and things are just getting worse and more intense,” Carvalho said.

Clarisse Bressan, a tropical medicine specialist working at Rio’s Fiocruz Covid hospital, said she had detected a similar shift in the last three weeks, including a disturbing rise in the number of pregnant women being admitted. “The average age really has gone down. One Friday we had more patients in their 40s than over-80s.”

“The patients seem to be suffering a more drawn-out illness. They deteriorate later – after 12 or 14 days rather than 10 – and I’ve seen young people with more symptoms,” Bressan added. “They don’t necessarily end up with more serious conditions but I’m seeing fewer completely asymptomatic young people than I did at the start of the pandemic.”

The explanation for the generational shift remains unclear, although some suspect a highly transmissible new variant linked to the Brazilian Amazon may be partly to blame. “It’s clearly connected to the P1 variant,” said Marcos Boulos, a infectious disease specialist from the University of São Paulo who believes the virus is now both spreading faster and hitting young people harder.

Boulos said the vaccination of older Brazilians partly explained the increasing proportion of younger patients in ICU. “But there’s no doubt young people are being [physically] more affected by this new variant. It’s unquestionable.”

“Sometimes … these young people will die after just a few hours or days with very acute, severe illnesses – and you won’t find any comorbidity or factor to explain why. It’s dramatic,” added Boulos, pointing to similar suspicions that the South African variant might be affecting the young more.

Bressan suspected behavioural factors were also at play, with younger Brazilians more likely to be frequenting places where they might be exposed to greater doses of the virus, more often. “It’s younger people who are going out to work, to parties, restaurants and nightclubs,” said Bressan, adding that many of the patients she was now seeing in their 40s were domestic workers, cleaners, retail workers and waiters. “People who absolutely have to leave home to work.”

Castro has no idea which variant brought him to the casualty of a hospital on Rio’s northern outskirts last month, with a raging temperature and a respiratory system on the verge of collapse. “My lungs were totally black,” he said, recalling how one doctor told him it was a miracle he had made it there at all. “You should be drowning on dry land,” the doctor said as Castro was rushed into an improvised ICU.

“It’s terrifying,” he said of what he saw inside. “It’s like those war films where you see a warehouse full of wounded people and say, ‘No this is just a scene from a movie – The Walking Dead.’ Only it’s for real. This is what’s happening.”

After a sleepless night, Castro was moved to a specialist Covid unit where he came within a whisker of death. His oxygen levels plummeted and he suffered a series of cardiac arrests, with his heart rate shooting up to 140 beats per minute, then back down to 40.

“I remember feeling something so strange that I’d never felt before. I felt so cold, so much pain. My chest hurt so much. I was coughing so much. Everything hurt. And then suddenly everything just stopped. The feeling I had was that I was going to die. I didn’t feel afraid any more. I didn’t feel pain. I didn’t feel the cold. I stopped feeling everything … it was as if my body had switched off … I felt I was dead.”

More than 66,000 Brazilians lost their lives last month and as many as 100,000 are expected to die in April with their country now the global epicentre of the pandemic. But somehow Castro survived, the inflammation and infection suddenly clearing over the next four days before he was allowed to return to his home in the Chatuba favela.

“Dude, this is a miracle,” Castro remembered his doctor telling him as he was discharged into the arms of his overjoyed wife and 20-month-old son, Arthur. “Your lungs are really badly damaged but you’ve beaten the disease.”

A month later, Castro said he still suffered occasional panic attacks and fatigue and was relearning how to breathe, walk and eat. A childhood friend was also struggling to recover after being taken off a ventilator. She was so weak she was using a walking frame to get around. “We’re talking about someone in her 20s, who exercises, eats well … and doesn’t have any major health problems and now she’s debilitated like a 90-year-old woman.”

Castro, who believes he was infected at a small family gathering, said he hoped telling his story would convince other young Brazilians to take fewer risks.

“Contrary to what they say, this disease is extremely aggressive. It does attack young people,” he said. “Maybe with you it won’t be so aggressive – maybe you’ll feel nothing. But the person next to you – your friend, your dad, your mum, your uncle, your aunt – they might never make it home.”",1317,7740,14,88
0,Taiwan Charges Man With Causing Deadliest Rail Accident in Decades,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/world/asia/taiwan-train-crash-charge.html?referringSource=articleShare,"Prosecutors said that Mr. Lee was trying to maneuver the crane truck around a hairpin turn when it got stuck in the bushes on the edge of the slope. He got out and tried to dislodge the truck, but it tumbled down the embankment onto the railway track.

Neither Mr. Lee nor Mr. Hua attempted to alert authorities to the situation, the prosecutors said.

Just over one minute later, the Taroko Express, which was packed with 498 people, including many families who were on their way to scenic eastern Taiwan for the Tomb Sweeping holiday weekend, emerged from a nearby tunnel and collided with the vehicle. The train had been traveling at about 80 miles an hour, investigators have said.

The prosecutors said they were bringing multiple charges against Mr. Lee, including negligent homicide, leaving the crash scene and falsifying his credentials to apply for the project.

If convicted on all counts, Mr. Lee could face up to twelve years in prison, Ms. Chou said in an interview.

Mr. Hua and two other project supervisors who were not at the crash site that day have also been charged with negligent homicide, a crime which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison. The police department had previously said that Mr. Hua was a migrant worker from Vietnam.

The revelation that the crane truck had been associated with a government-commissioned project has triggered an increasingly heated public discussion in recent days about the Taiwan Railways Administration, which runs the Taroko Express and was also the agency behind the slope safety scheme.",261,1560,10,66
0,China Backs Away as Philippines and U.S. Send Impressive Fleet to West Philippine Sea,https://www.esquiremag.ph/politics/news/china-backs-down-a00293-20210416-lfrm,"In a surprising move, the Philippines sent its strongest response yet against China’s expansion into the West Philippine Sea. Not since 2012 has the Philippines moved its naval forces to the West Philippine Sea to challenge China’s militarization of the area. The move is a highly coordinated response with the United States.

In March, the Philippines reported the presence of 220 Chinese vessels at Julian Felipe Reef. That number has been reduced to fewer than 10 as of April 13.

“The Chinese have blinked,” retired U.S. Navy officer Jerry Hendrix told Forbes.

Below are photos taken by the Philippine Coast Guard on April 13 and 14 showing Philippine and Chinese vessels at Julian Felipe Reef.

The Philippines sent four of its most advanced warships to the West Philippine Sea to challenge China’s increasing activities at Julian Felipe Reef. Among the units it deployed are its two brand-new missile-guided frigates, the BRP Jose Rizal and the BRP Antonio Luna. It also deployed warplanes to monitor the area.

Meanwhile, the U.S. also sent its aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt to the area. But an American aircraft carrier never travels alone. With every sighting of a U.S. carrier, you can expect it brings along a large escort of submarines, destroyers, and cruisers protecting it from other vessels. This is on top of the dozens of aircraft it carries (it can carry up to 90 aircraft and can accommodate 4,500 personnel).

The U.S. also deployed the USS Makin Island, a formidable assault ship that can carry up to 20 attack aircraft or stealth strike-fighters. It also has its own escorts of submarines, destroyers, and cruisers.

In March 2021, the Philippine Coast Guard raised the alarm over the presence of 220 Chinese ships forming a phalanx at Julian Felipe Reef, which is within the country’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ). It was what prompted the coordinated military response from the Philippines and the United States.

ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW

By April, the Chinese vessels have dissipated to a couple of dozen, a clear sign of China backing down in response to the forceful reaction from the Philippines and the U.S.

China used the same strategy in the past whenever it wanted to militarize a Philippine reef: It would send a large flotilla of paramilitary “fishing boats” to the area to scare away other vessels, then its dredgers would follow, destroying precious corals to create artificial islands over the reef. Julian Felipe Reef would have ended up with the same fate.

An Unexpected Philippine Response

Ever since the 2012 standoff at Scarborough Shoal between China and the Philippines, the latter has opted not to send warships from the navy but relied on vessels from the Philippine Coast Guard instead to assert its presence in the West Philippine Sea. It was because of the ongoing international arbitration with China that the Philippines eventually won in 2016—the Philippines did not want to jeopardize its case and be construed as an aggressor.

But ever since then, the country had downplayed Chinese incursions into the West Philippine Sea.

The latest development proves significant, not only because the Philippines actually challenged China, but also because it is the first time it has sent a weapon of war to assert itself. To the Chinese generals, that is something to be very serious about. Historically, China respects force, no matter how seemingly small it is.

China Respects Force

According to professor and geopolitical analyst Richard Heydarian, China respects power.

“Chinese statecraft has contempt for the weak and the naive,” Heydarian told Esquire Philippines in 2020. “But China grudgingly respects those with strategic dignity and courage.”

For example, Indonesia, which has taken a very strong stance against China on its sea disputes and even sunk a number of confiscated Chinese vessels, has already received 1.2 million initial doses of the vaccine delivered from China in November. Another 1.8 million doses were delivered in January, and more are expected to come.

It also helps that the U.S. has specifically stated any attack on Philippine vessels would trigger its Mutual Defense Treaty obligations.

“An armed attack against the Philippines armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft in the Pacific, including in the South China Sea, will trigger our obligations under the Mutual Defense Treaty,"" the U.S. State Department warned.

In the past, the U.S. had been vague about the Mutual Defense Treaty and its scope, saying obligations would only be triggered if they happen within the Philippines’ territorial waters, not its EEZ. It looks like they are changing that position now.

In any case, it looks like China will not be militarizing Julian Felipe Reef anytime soon.

On the frontline in Ukraine's east, battle-weary soldiers are sceptical that US sanctions against Moscow and Kiev's appeal for NATO help will deter Russian strongman Vladimir Putin. Faced with the largest deployment of Russian troops on Ukraine's borders since 2014, President Volodymyr Zelensky has requested more tangible help from the West, but many Ukrainian troops say they know they are on their own.

""We should only count on ourselves,"" Taras Mykytsey, a 52-year-old soldier, told AFP in the frontline village of Zaytseve north of the separatist stronghold Donetsk.

The separatists, who have carved out two ""People's Republics"" in eastern Ukraine, are backed by Russia.

""While we are waiting for something to be sent to us, Putin will not wait,"" added Mykytsey, sporting a helmet and a bulletproof vest.

Yuriy, a 29-year-old senior sergeant based near the town of Shchastya in the neighbouring Lugansk region, struck a similar note, saying he did not expect Western boots on the ground any time soon.

""What foreign country would want to send its people to their death?"" he said.

Yuriy, who declined to give his last name, added that the Russian president would not buckle.

""Sanctions and negotiations can, of course, restrain Russia a little, but in general, these negotiations for Putin, it's like throwing sand against the wind,"" he said.

US President Joe Biden has pledged his ""unwavering support"" to Zelensky, and Washington this week hit Moscow with new sanctions over US election interference and other hostile activity.

After talks in Paris on Friday with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Ukranian leader called for a four-way summit with Putin and the resumption of a ceasefire upended by a recent spate of clashes between Kiev troops and the separatists.

'Ready for any scenario'

Under a grey spring sky, birdsong can be heard on the frontline but the tranquil spell cannot mask a spike in tensions and near daily clashes.

Around 30 Ukrainian troops have been killed since the start of the year, compared to 50 last year. Most of them were victims of sniper fire.

This week, ""a soldier was killed and two others from our battalion were wounded"" in an explosion, said 43-year-old Yuriy, speaking to AFP in the trenches near Zaytseve.

Yuriy, who also declined to give his last name, said the explosion was caused by a Russian-made landmine.

The Ukrainian military accuses Moscow of seeking to provoke a situation that would justify an armed operation.

""The enemy's task is to cause as many losses as possible and provoke return fire,"" Viktor Ganushchak, the deputy commander of Ukraine's military operation in the east, told AFP in the town of Avdiivka, some six kilometres (four miles) north of Donetsk.

Russia has denied sending weapons and soldiers across the border and says its troop movements do not pose a threat to anyone.

More than 13,000 people have been killed in a conflict which broke out after a popular uprising in Kiev ousted a Kremlin-backed president and Moscow moved to annex Crimea in 2014.

Some Ukrainian soldiers were hard-pressed to explain the Russian show of muscle, with others dismissing it as mere sabre-rattling.

""If it were an assault, it would be done more quietly without so much fuss,"" said Yuriy, the senior sergeant.

Mykytsey said Russia's plans were anyone's guess.

""Are they preparing for an assault or are these military exercises?"" he said.

""Our task is to prevent them from going any further. We have people and there are enough weapons.""

Over the past seven years, Ukraine has overhauled its army thanks to Western help, and Kiev's battle-hardened soldiers say they are ready for a repeat of Moscow's 2014 aggression.

""We are ready for any scenario,"" said Ganushchak. ""This is our land, we will defend it.""

“If we are to truly unite in beating this virus, on behalf of the vaccine industry outside the U.S., I humbly request you to lift the embargo of raw material exports out of the U.S. so that vaccine production can ramp up,” wrote Adar Poonawalla, CEO of Serum Institute of India.

He had earlier told The Associated Press that pivoting away from suppliers in the U.S. could result in a delay of up to six months for the production of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Novavax. Serum Institute and Novavax have inked a deal to supply 1.1 billion doses of the vaccine to COVAX to equitably distribute it across the globe.

Separately, 10 Democratic senators are urging Biden to back India and South Africa’s appeal to the World Trade Organization to temporarily relax intellectual property rules so coronavirus vaccines can be manufactured by nations that are struggling to inoculate their populations.

The lawmakers, in a letter delivered to the White House on Thursday evening, wrote that Biden should “prioritize people over pharmaceutical company profits” and support the temporary waiver of the rules. A waiver, which is supported by more than 100 nations, could pave the way for generic or other manufacturers to make more vaccines.

India, in particular, is facing tremendous need. Serum Institute of India paused exports to COVAX after a devastating surge of infections in India resulted in increased domestic demand.

Over 200,000 new infections were detected in the past 24 hours, and major cities, like Mumbai and New Delhi, are under virus restrictions. Hospitals are overwhelmed, and authorities are scrambling to try to vaccinate enough people to slow down the spread. But in doing so, India relies heavily on AstraZeneca shots made by Serum Institute of India.

Poonawalla had said the unavailability of the raw materials, such as the specific medium needed to grow microorganisms, would prevent Serum Institute from scaling up the production of the vaccine developed by Novavax.

The company had been planning to make up to 40 million shots of the vaccine monthly.

Ramping up the production of this shot could also help India. Novavax has applied for authorization of the vaccine to regulators in Europe, the U.S. and the World Health Organization. If the vaccine is approved, India would be able to use it under new regulations that make it easier to greenlight vaccines that have received the nod by the U.K., the U.S., Europe, Japan or WHO.

The United States and Brazil are at an impasse on a deal to stop destruction of the Amazon rainforest, which has surged under right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

While Brazil wants to receive money upfront to pay for the protection of the world's largest rainforest, the United States is insistent on seeing results first before it opens the purse strings, sources said.

Bolsonaro is expected to attend the high-profile U.S. Earth Day summit that starts April 22.

While former President Donald Trump, a Bolsonaro ally, did not criticize Brazil over its handling of the Amazon, the Biden government has placed the issue at the center of its relations with South America's largest country.

Talks between the two sides began in February with a call between U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry and Brazil's environment and foreign ministers.

Lower-level negotiations since then have focused on the soaring destruction in Brazil's share of the Amazon - a vital bulwark against climate change.

Deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon surged in 2019 after Bolsonaro took office and hit a 12-year high in 2020 when an area 14 times the size of New York City was destroyed, according to government data.

""We would hope to see a very clear commitment to ending illegal deforestation, tangible steps to increase the effective enforcement of illegal deforestation, and a political signal that illegal deforestation and encroachment will not be tolerated,"" a State Department spokesperson said in a statement when asked about the talks.

""We believe it is realistic for Brazil to achieve a real decrease in deforestation by the end of the 2021 fire season.""

The spokesperson said the United States hoped Bolsonaro would use the summit to demonstrate his seriousness about climate and the Amazon.

Brazil's foreign ministry in a statement said the meetings were exploratory and not formal negotiations.

The ministry said its efforts to combat deforestation since 2006 have avoided billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions that if properly compensated would have a value of $30 billion to $40 billion.

To effectively combat deforestation, ""large resources are needed, especially from international cooperation,"" the ministry said.

A central impasse in negotiations remains on when the United States would pay Brazil.

Environment Minister Ricardo Salles, who is leading the Brazilian negotiators, has publicly asked for $1 billion in foreign aid in advance, that potentially could come from the United States with other partners. One of the sources confirmed that request has been made in the talks.

Salles told Brazilian newspaper O Estado de S.Paulo this month that upon receiving that money, Brazil could lower deforestation by 30%-40% in a span of 12 months.

Without money up front, he said Brazil would not be able to set a hard target.

But U.S. officials want to pay only once there are results. That includes a decline in deforestation this year, the two sources familiar with the negotiations said.

Bolsonaro appeared to meet one of the U.S. demands on Wednesday, with newspaper Folha de S.Paulo reporting he had sent a letter to Biden affirming that Brazil would end illegal deforestation by 2030.

That target was part of Brazil's Paris agreement commitment made under the left-wing government of former President Dilma Rousseff, leaving doubts over whether Bolsonaro was working towards it.

A deal nevertheless seems unlikely by next week.

“I would not bet money on it,” one of the sources told Reuters. “It’s not that there’s been a lack of interest: it’s just that I don’t think there has been enough time to discuss a specific deal.”

0,Moderna to slash vaccine deliveries to Canada,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/moderna-delay-1.5990166,"Moderna will send far fewer COVID-19 shots to Canada this month than originally planned as the company grapples with production issues at its facilities in Europe.

But its main competitor, Pfizer — which also produces a highly effective mRNA vaccine against the novel coronavirus — has said it will send millions more doses to Canada in May, June and beyond, a commitment that will more than cover the shortfall from Moderna.

Massachusetts-based Moderna was poised to send 1.2 million more doses to Canada this month, but that shipment has been cut back to just 650,000 shots.

While those vaccines were to arrive next week, the reduced shipment is now not expected until later this month — possibly as late as the first week of May.

And although Canada was expecting to receive 12.3 million doses of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine by the end of June, the company has now told officials that it will be one to two million shots short of that goal. Delivery of those doses will be pushed into the July-through-September period.

Pfizer steps up

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday that while the delay in Moderna's shipments is disappointing, Canada has now signed an agreement with Pfizer for eight million more vaccine doses on top of what has already been promised.

Canada will receive four million more Pfizer doses in May, another two million in June and two million more in July, Trudeau said.

That means Canada's immunization campaign will have access to two million doses per week of the Pfizer product in May and 2.5 million shots per week in the month of June — vaccine stocks that are badly needed as the country grapples with a punishing third wave of cases.

""I want to thank everyone at Pfizer for their cooperation and hard work, not just to keep deliveries on schedule, but to move more doses up and reach new agreements,"" Trudeau said.

Trudeau said that despite disruptions at its European facilities in January, when plant upgrades resulted in dramatically reduced shipments, Pfizer has proven to be a very reliable supplier. He said its product will constitute the ""bulk of the vaccinations we're going to be giving Canadians in the coming months.""

WATCH: Trudeau on changes to vaccine delivery schedules

Pfizer to send millions of additional doses of COVID-19 vaccine to Canada between May and July Politics News 1:18 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that Canada will receive 4 million additional doses of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine in May, another 2 million in June and 2 million more in July. 1:18

Canada is now expecting 23.8 million doses of the Pfizer product in the second quarter of this year alone, up from the 17.8 million doses that had been expected.

Even with the Moderna disruptions — which could punt delivery of up to two million shots to a later date — Canada will receive at least 4 million more shots in May and June than anticipated, thanks to the Pfizer deal.

The country is now expecting delivery of 48 to 50 million doses from all vaccine suppliers in the first six months of this year.

Based on those figures, Trudeau said, every Canadian adult should be able to receive at least one dose by the end of June.

The Moderna delays are being attributed to ""a slower than anticipated ramp-up of their production capacity"" at plants in Europe, Public Services and Procurement Minister Anita Anand said.

""We are disappointed, and while we understand the challenges facing suppliers in the current global market for vaccines, our government will continue to press Moderna to fulfil its commitments,"" Anand said.

""Remember, a year ago vaccines didn't exist for COVID-19. Supply chains and manufacturing systems did not exist either.""

WATCH: Procurement Minister Anita Anand offers update on vaccine deliveries

Minister says Canada to receive millions more Pfizer doses as Moderna announces delivery delays Politics News 3:03 Federal Procurement Minister Anita Anand spoke with reporters during the regular Friday pandemic briefing. 3:03

""When Moderna provides additional information, we will share it as soon as it is received. We continue to press Moderna for consistency of supply to Canada,"" Anand said.

The 855,000 doses of the Moderna product that were supposed to arrive the week of April 5 have only started to show up over the last several days, hampering planned immunization clinics in some provinces.

To help offset the short-term supply gap, Anand said Johnson & Johnson has confirmed the first shipment of its one-dose viral vector shot will arrive at month's end.

The U.S.-based pharmaceutical giant will send 300,000 doses to Canada during the week of April 27 with ""more substantial deliveries coming in the latter part of this quarter and into the summer,"" she said.

Moderna making 'adjustments'

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the Moderna delays will result in more vaccination cancellations at public health and hospital-run clinics in the province.

He urged the prime minister to secure more vaccine supply to help the province beat back the third wave that has strained hospital capacity.

""By hook or by crook or whatever,"" Ford said, the federal government needs to procure more shots for Ontario.

""If we continue getting dribs and drabs and missing Moderna shipments, we aren't getting out of this. More people are going to die, more people will be in ICUs. If we can ramp it up to 300,000 a day ... it's night and day,"" Ford said, pointing to modelling numbers that suggest administering thousands more shots a day would bend the infection curve.

""It all comes down to one thing, the supply of vaccines, as simple as that. The bottom line is, would we be in this position if we were getting 300,000 vaccines back in February? The answer is absolutely not. We wouldn't be facing the crisis.""

(Frank Gunn/Canadian Press)

In a statement, a spokesperson for Moderna said it would be making ""adjustments"" to the number of shots it sends to Canada and some other countries in the coming weeks.

""The trajectory of vaccine manufacturing ramp-up is not linear, and despite best efforts, there is a shortfall in previously estimated doses from the European supply chain. Vaccine manufacturing is a highly complex process and a number of elements, including human and material resources, have factored into this volatility,"" the spokesperson said.

The company said it will make ""substantial capital investments"" to bolster production and explore ""other potential collaboration opportunities"" so that it can make more shots to meet insatiable global demand for its highly effective product.

Before COVID-19 hit, Moderna had no experience in producing such products on a large scale. It has partnered with Switzerland-based pharmaceutical manufacturer Lonza to help make its vaccine. The company also has contracted with other companies in the U.S. to pump out its mRNA vaccines for the American marketplace.",1182,7228,7,45
0,Biden hits Russia with new sanctions in response to election meddling,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/15/joe-biden-russia-sanctions-election-interference-hacking,"The Biden administration has announced the expulsion of 10 Russian diplomats and broad sanctions against Russian officials and companies in retaliation for Moscow’s interference in elections and cyber-espionage campaigns such as the SolarWinds hack.

The sanctions, which were the Biden administration’s largest punitive action against the Kremlin yet, also targeted six Russian cybersecurity companies deemed to be involved in the SolarWinds hack, as well as 32 individuals and entities deemed to be involved in efforts to influence the outcome of the 2020 US presidential election.

The Biden administration also barred US financial institutions from buying rouble bonds newly issued by Russia’s central bank or other large financial institutions, targeting the country’s sovereign debt and its broader economy.

In a formal statement later on Thursday, Joe Biden stressed the calibrated nature of the US measures, and his hopes that he and Vladimir Putin, whom he had warned about the coming sanctions earlier in the week, would be able to stabilise the US-Russian relationship. But at the same time he warned against any Russian military moves in Ukraine.

“I was clear with President Putin that we could have gone further, but I chose not to do so. I chose to be proportional. The United States is not looking to kick off a cycle of escalation and conflict with Russia,” Biden said in televised remarks from the White House. He confirmed he had offered Putin a summit meeting in Europe this summer, and their aides were discussing arrangements.

“Throughout our long history of competition, our two countries have been able to find ways to manage tensions, and to keep them from escalating out of control,” the president said. “I expressed my belief that communication between the two of us personally and directly was essential to moving forward to a more effective relationship.”

He said he had made clear US support for Ukrainian territorial integrity. “Now is the time to de-escalate,” Biden said. “The way forward is through thoughtful dialogue and diplomatic process.”

The report published by the administration went into granular detail exposing Russian espionage methods. For the first time, the US identified the SVR, Russia’s foreign intelligence agency, as the spy agency that carried out the SolarWinds software supply chain hack, which penetrated federal government networks and compromised more than 16,000 computers systems. Members of Russian intelligence would be among the diplomats expelled from the United States, the White House said.

Q&A What was the SolarWinds hack? Show In early 2020, malicious code was sneaked into updates to a popular piece of software called Orion, made in the US by the company SolarWinds, which monitors the computer networks of businesses and governments for outages. That malware gave hackers remote access to an organisation’s networks so they could steal information. Among the most high-profile users of the software were US government departments including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the state department, and the justice department. Described by the Microsoft president, Brad Smith, as “the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen"", US intelligence agencies have accused Russia of launching the attack. SolarWinds, of Austin, Texas, provides network monitoring and other technical services to hundreds of thousands of organisations around the world, including most Fortune 500 companies and government agencies in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. Its compromised product, Orion, is a centralised monitoring tool that looks for problems in an organisation’s computer network, which means that breaking in gave the attackers a “God view” of those networks. Neither SolarWinds nor US cybersecurity authorities have publicly identified which organisations were breached. Just because a company or agency uses SolarWinds as a vendor does not necessarily mean it was vulnerable to the hack. Kari Paul and Martin Belam

In a coordinated release, the British spy agency GCHQ on Thursday also attributed the SolarWinds hack to the SVR, and accused the agency of targeting diplomatic and military institutions in Nato countries since 2011 and research institutes since 2015. Previously identified as APT 29, Cozy Bear and the Dukes, the SVR has also been accused of penetrating the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 US presidential elections.

“We see what Russia is doing to undermine our democracies,” said the British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, in a statement. “The UK and US are calling out Russia’s malicious behaviour, to enable our international partners and businesses at home to better defend and prepare themselves against this kind of action.”

The UK foreign office said it had summoned the Russian ambassador in London to express its deep concern at what it called Moscow’s “pattern of malign activity”.

Russian officials reacted angrily to the new sanctions, with some saying it would scuttle any chance of a summit between Biden and Vladimir Putin. The Russian foreign ministry summoned the US ambassador for a “difficult talk” and called the sanctions “aggressive behaviour”, adding that Russian counter-sanctions were “inevitable”.

Those sanctioned included Alexei Gromov, a Kremlin official who curates Russia’s media and was accused of seeking “to exacerbate tensions in the United States by discrediting the 2020 US elections process”. Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Kremlin-linked businessman accused of running the Internet Research Agency online trolling operation and an overseas paramilitary outfit, was a key target of the sanctions, as were information outlets tied to Russian intelligence agencies. Konstantin Kilimnik, a Ukrainian political consultant and former aide to Paul Manafort, was also sanctioned for election interference and aiding Ukraine’s disgraced ex-president Viktor Yanukovych.

Officials had said that the new sanctions were meant to cut deeper than previous attempts to punish Moscow for its attacks on US institutions and allies. Some Russian officials have laughed off being added to the treasury department’s office of foreign assets control (OFAC) sanctions lists, comparing it to being elevated to an elite club.

There are some limits to the severity of the sanctions. Many of those in Prigozhin’s network targeted by the sanctions are intentionally expendable, and the ban on buying rouble bonds only applies to their primary issue, meaning they would remain available to trade on secondary markets.

The sanctions on IT companies that contract with government agencies could be disruptive for the sector, said Vladimir Frolov, a political analyst, but “other than that, it’s largely a signal exercise” to show Biden negotiating from a position of strength.

Nonetheless, Frolov added, Moscow might have “to respond aggressively to deny Biden the optics advantage of negotiating from a position of strength and chewing gum”.

There are already signs that the sanctions will add tension to an already strained relationship between Russia and the US. Since last month, Moscow has been engaged in the largest troop buildup on its border with Ukraine since the 2014 annexation of Crimea, provoking fears of an invasion.

The US president’s tough approach differs considerably from that of the Trump administration, which sought to avoid confronting Russia over reports of election interference. During a summit in Helsinki, Trump sided with Putin over an FBI assessment that Russia had interfered in the 2016 elections, saying: “President Putin says it’s not Russia. I don’t see any reason why it would be.”

The sanctions are also retaliation for Russian interference in the 2020 elections, in which US intelligence agencies concluded that the Kremlin had backed Trump over Biden, although it is not believed to have considerably influenced the result.

Dmitri Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, said Russia would retaliate against the new sanctions. “The principle of reciprocity applies … to best ensure our own interests.”

A senior US official said: “We want to be clear that we have no desire to be in an escalatory cycle with Russia … We intend these responses to be proportionate and tailored to the specific past actions that Russia has taken.”

He explained that until now US sanctions had covered non-rouble denominated debt, a small part of Russia’s total sovereign debt. Rouble denominated portion accounts for over 80%.

“This is a matter of principle. There’s no credible reason why the American people should directly fund Russia’s government when the Putin regime has repeatedly attempted to undermine our sovereignty,” the official said.

The Biden administration announced sanctions last month over the poisoning and imprisonment of the opposition politician Alexei Navalny. The sanctions included visa restrictions, export restrictions on items that could be used to make chemical and biological weapons, and targeted action against seven senior members of the Russian government.

The measures also entailed an expansion of sanctions under the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act.",1411,9205,11,69

WASHINGTON—Putting the nation on alert against what it has described as a “highly credible terrorist threat,” the FBI announced today that it has uncovered a plot by members of al-Qaeda to sit back and enjoy themselves while the United States collapses of its own accord.

Multiple intelligence agencies confirmed that the militant Islamist organization and its numerous affiliates intend to carry out a massive, coordinated plan to stand aside and watch America’s increasingly rapid decline, with terrorist operatives across the globe reportedly mobilizing to take it easy, relax, and savor the spectacle as it unfolds.

“We have intercepted electronic communication indicating that al-Qaeda members are actively plotting to stay out of the way while America as we know it gradually crumbles under the weight of its own self-inflicted debt and disrepair,” FBI Deputy Director Mark F. Giuliano told the assembled press corps. “If this plan succeeds, it will leave behind a nation with a completely dysfunctional economy, collapsing infrastructure, and a catastrophic health crisis afflicting millions across the nation. We want to emphasize that this danger is very real.”

“And unfortunately, based on information we have from intelligence assets on the ground, this plot is already well under way,” he added.

A recently declassified CIA report confirmed that all known al-Qaeda-affiliated organizations—from Pakistan to Yemen, and from Somalia to Algeria—have been instructed to kick back and enjoy the show as the United States’ federal government, energy grid, and industrial sector are rendered impotent by internal dissent, decay, and mismanagement. According to statements made by top-level informants and corroborated by leading Western terrorism experts, if seen through to its conclusion, al-Qaeda’s current plot could wreak far more damage than the events of 9/11.

In the past year, money transfers to al-Qaeda cells around the world have reportedly been accompanied by instructions to use the funds to outfit safe houses with the proper equipment to receive American cable news broadcasts and view top U.S. news websites, allowing terrorists to fully relish each detail of the impending demise of the last global superpower.

Additionally, FBI officials made public an internal al-Qaeda video today in which the terrorist organization’s leader Ayman al-Zawahiri chillingly exhorts his followers to “take a load off” and “unwind” in the name of jihad, and really cherish the victory over their enemy.

“Praise Allah, for soon every American city shall be plagued with disaster and hardship,” al-Zawahiri said in the video, which includes several minutes of footage of young, masked al-Qaeda militants casually sipping beverages as they thumb through the latest issues of Time and U.S. News And World Report. “The infidels have brought this pain and destruction upon themselves through their arrogance and callousness. Soon, the United States will watch in horror as its bridges crumble, its desperate citizens suffer in want of medicine and paying employment, and its once vast riches are reduced to naught. The righteous warriors among our ranks must now unite, get comfortable, and look on from afar at the calamity unfolding in the West.”

“We vow that we will not cease sitting around and laughing it up until America is reduced to rubble,” he continued.

Al-Zawahiri, who is seen in the video reclining back in his chair, putting his feet up, and flipping on CNN, later shouts “Allahu Akbar!” when a story is aired about the decade-long trend of stagnant wages among American workers.

The FBI has also warned that numerous al-Qaeda agents may have established sleeper cells for the purpose of “getting a kick out of” the nation’s downfall on American soil. The bureau urged U.S. residents to use caution around schools, hospitals, legislative bodies, prisons, and other decaying institutions whose imminent failure terrorists may wish to observe up close.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, one high-ranking U.S. counterterrorism official has described the present situation as a massive failure of intelligence.

“The warning signs were there all along, but unfortunately we failed to heed them,” said the official, who advised Americans to brace for widespread devastation. “If we’d listened to experts or even our own common sense, we would’ve realized that this plot was being actively orchestrated within our own borders. But we didn’t, and now every one of our citizens and our very way of life is at risk from this threat.”

“Sadly, al-Qaeda has us right where they want us,” the official added, “and at this point, I fear it is too late to do anything about it.”

Responding to the allegations, a spokesperson for al-Qaeda reportedly confirmed the terror group’s plot and praised the American people as martyrs of the highest order.",791,5078,14,79

But Abiy’s description is apt in another way too. His forces are now battling invisible guerrillas whom they are unable completely to subdue. Last year, soon after federal troops entered Mekelle, the Tigrayan capital, Abiy declared victory. Now he admits that defeating “an enemy which is in hiding” will be “very difficult”.

As the war drags on, the human toll mounts. In recent weeks tens of thousands of Tigrayans have fled what American officials have described as ethnic cleansing in western Tigray. Possibly thousands of civilians have been murdered by armed forces on all sides. Women and doctors in Tigray report mass rape by both Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiers. “The conflict is ongoing and human-rights violations are happening every day,” says Finland’s foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, who is the EU ’s special envoy to Ethiopia.

The war’s economic costs are ruinous, too. Life had been improving. Between 2000 and 2016 the share of Ethiopians who could not afford to buy a basket of food containing the minimum number of calories they need fell from 44% to 24%. Such huge gains, made in Africa’s second-most populous country, are now under threat.

Start with the direct costs of reconstruction. Eyob Tolina, Ethiopia’s finance minister, estimates that the price of repairing damaged infrastructure will be around $1bn (about 1% of GDP ). Schools, universities and hospitals have been looted or destroyed, as have farms and factories.

Longer-term costs are harder to quantify, but are piling up. Before the war Tigray produced a third of Ethiopia’s sesame exports, worth almost $350m a year, a tenth of total exports. Since then, tens of thousands of farmers have fled, abandoning the harvest. Although business in Mekelle is slowly picking up, banks and markets in much of the region are still closed. Officials shrug off the economic impact. In January the trade ministry said that the closure of factories and roads in Tigray was losing the country $20m a month in exports. Abiy has since trumpeted a 21% rise in exports, largely thanks to a huge surge in earnings from gold. The government insists that the economy will grow by 8.5% in 2021. The IMF, however , reckons growth will be closer to 2%. The government’s confidence is based on an assumption that the war’s impact will be limited to Tigray, which accounts for less than 10% of the national economy. “Tigray...is a geographically small part of the country,” says a senior government adviser. “Certainly not a big macro issue.” Public debt has fallen by more than a tenth since reaching a peak of almost 60% of GDP three years ago, even after a small rise because of covid-19. But how long can the economy bear a prolonged conflict? Inflation, which was running at 18% before the war, is now above 20%. Foreign exchange is cripplingly scarce. On the black market the Ethiopian birr has fallen by 9% against the dollar in recent months. Businesses trying to get foreign currency through official channels often wait at least a year to get their allocation from state-owned banks.

The government has asked the IMF and the World Bank to bail it out. In February it said it would apply for debt relief under a programme aimed at helping poor countries affected by covid-19. Rating agencies duly downgraded Ethiopia’s debt. The government also hopes to get a windfall from auctioning two new mobile-phone licences and later selling a 45% share of Ethio Telecom, the mobile-phone monopoly.

But relief, whether from lenders or investors, may be slow. Faced with reports of atrocities as well as uncertainty concerning elections, which are planned for June, foreign investors are nervous. “Everything is on hold,” reports one of them. Officials fret that extra support from donors may not be forthcoming. In January the European Union suspended €88m ($107m) of budget support until aid agencies are given full access to Tigray.

Ethiopia also has little room for manoeuvre. Under the terms of an existing IMF programme it cannot easily borrow more. Nor can it just print money. The treasury has been able to finance its deficit by selling treasury bills, mostly to state-owned pension funds (previously it simply forced banks to hold public debt at below-market rates). But the government will face a balance-of-payments crisis unless it can get hard currency to finance imports and service its foreign-denominated debts.

Allies such as China, Russia and, especially, countries in the Gulf may help to plug the gap. Meanwhile the conflict is spreading. People in Tigray are already starving. Mass famine looms. Elsewhere in the country ethnic violence is worsening. In recent weeks hundreds of people have died in clashes between Oromos and Amharas, the country’s two biggest groups, as well as between ethnic Somalis and Afars in the east. Eyob, the finance minister, sounds optimistic, arguing that in recent months the economy has shown “resilience” in the face of the crisis. On the ground, though, the situation looks increasingly dire. ■",952,5749,14,70

HAVANA -- Raul Castro said Friday he is stepping down as head of Cuba’s Communist Party, ending an era of formal leadership that began with his brother Fidel and country’s 1959 revolution.

The 89-year-old Castro made the announcement in a speech at the opening of the eighth congress of the ruling party, the only one allowed on the island.

He said he was retiring with the sense of having “fulfilled his mission and confident in the future of the fatherland.”

“Nothing, nothing, nothing is forcing me to make this decision,” said Castro, part of whose speech to the closed Congress was aired on state television. “As long as I live I will be ready with my foot in the stirrup to defend the homeland, the revolution and socialism with more force than ever.”

Castro didn’t say who he would endorse as his successor as first secretary of the Communist Party. But he previously indicated he favors yielding control to 60-year-old Miguel Díaz-Canel, who succeeded him as president in 2018 and is the standard bearer of a younger generation of loyalists who have been pushing an economic opening without touching Cuba’s one-party system.

Photographs released by the official Cuban News Agency showed Castro, dressed in an olive green uniform, entering the compound with Díaz-Canel by his side.

Castro's retirement means that for the first time in more than six decades Cubans won’t have a Castro formally guiding their affairs and many had been expecting the change.

“One has to step aside for the young people,"" said 64-year-old retiree Juana Busutil, for whom Castro “is going to continue being the leader.”

The transition comes at a difficult time for Cuba, with many on the island anxious about what lies ahead.

The coronavirus pandemic, painful financial reforms and restrictions imposed by the Trump administration have battered the economy, which shrank 11% last year as a result of a collapse in tourism and remittances. Long food lines and shortages have brought back echoes of the “special period” that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s.

Discontent has been fueled by the spread of the internet and growing inequality.

Much of the debate inside Cuba is focused on the pace of reform, with many complaining that the so-called “historic generation” represented by Castro has been too slow to open the economy.

In January, Díaz-Canel finally pulled the trigger on a plan approved two congresses ago to unify the island’s dual currency system, giving rise to fears of inflation. He also threw the doors open to a broader range of private enterprise — a category long banned or tightly restricted — permitting Cubans to legally operate many sorts of self-run businesses from their homes.

This year’s congress is expected to focus on unfinished reforms to overhaul state-run enterprises, attract foreign investment and provide more legal protection to private business activities.

The Communist Party is made up of 700,000 activists and is tasked in Cuba’s constitution with directing the affairs of the nation and society.

Fidel Castro, who led the revolution that drove dictator Fulgencio Batista from power in 1959, formally became head of the party in 1965, about four years after officially embracing socialism.

He quickly absorbed the old party under his control and was the country’s unquestioned leader until falling ill in 2006 and in 2008 handing over the presidency to his younger brother Raul, who had fought alongside him during the revolution.

Raul succeeded him as head of the party in 2011. Fidel Castro died in 2016

For most of his life, Raul played second-string to his brother Fidel — first as a guerrilla commander, later as a senior figure in their socialist government. But for the past decade, it’s Raul who has been the face of communist Cuba and its defiance of U.S. efforts to oust its socialist system.

The fourth of seven children of a Spanish immigrant in eastern Cuba, Raul had joined his charismatic older brother in a nearly suicidal attack on the Moncada military barracks in the eastern city of Santiago in 1953 and survived the crackdown that followed from the forces of dictator Fulgencio Batista.

He led a major front in the ensuing guerrilla war led by Fidel that toppled Batista. And he served for the following generation or two as head of the armed forces. For many years, he was considered a more orthodox communist than his brother.

But it was Raul who reached accords with U.S. President Barack Obama in 2014 that created the most extensive U.S. opening to Cuba since the early 1960s — creating a surge in contacts with the United States that was largely reversed under Obama’s successor, Donald Trump.

Now, with Raul Castro stepping down as party leader amid change and challenges, some say the island needs continuity going forward.

“All process have a continuity and I think Díaz-Canel should be there now,” said 58-year-old driver Miguel Rodríguez.",851,5124,10,60
0,Mexico: Communities want Bonafont water gone,https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/mexico-communities-want-bonafont-water-gone,"United States and European water bottling companies are making huge profits from packaging and selling Mexico’s water resources, while leaving locals without water.

Indigenous and local communities in Puebla state united in a 24-hour peaceful blockade of a Bonafont plant, which has continued for weeks.

People from Almoloya, Tlautla, Colonia José Ángeles, Ometoxtla, Zacatepec, Cuanalá, Nextetelco, Coronango, Tepalcatepec, Cuachayotla, Cuapan, Xoxtla and Cuautlancingo have shut the plant down and are demanding it pack up and leave.

“Things were wonderful 20 years ago, but now the Bonafont plant is here working day and night, drying up our wells and rivers. There were fish and frogs before, but now it is all dried up.

“Bonafont is an act of death, because now we can’t get any water from our wells … we have to buy water from pipas (privately owned trucks that sell water) and it’s expensive and isn’t enough to last the week,” said Gloria Mejias Cinto, a member of the Land and Water Defenders.

I am talking to her at the protest. Behind us, is a giant mural that says: “Water belongs to the people.”

Behind the food table are lots of children’s drawings about the importance of water. On the other side, people rest near their tents.

People from the different towns rotate on guard duty at the protest night and day. Large piles of rocks and concrete stop any company trucks from getting in or out.

“We’ll hold this protest until there is a resolution, until Bonafont leaves our country. Then we’ll hold assemblies of all our towns (in the area) and decide what to do,” said Mejias.

“Our water isn’t for sale, it’s not merchandise.”

The big and pointless business of bottling water

According to workers at the Bonafont plant, it extracts 1.4 million litres of water a day from the nearby Iztaccíhuatl volcanic springs, in the east of Puebla state.

One worker, who spoke anonymously to La Jornada de Oriente, said the pandemic emergency measures resulted in a 30% rise in demand for the 19-litre containers of filtered water.

The Bonafont plant has been in the area since 1996, and it legally has access to two drill sites to extract water, but locals say it is secretly extracting water in a third location, without the required permits.

Bonafont is a brand owned by Danone, a Paris-based food corporation. Danone claims it is taking steps to “tackle global water challenges” and its message in Mexico and other countries is of “healthy hydration”. However, bottling spring water hinders rather than helps water supply or hydration.

And while the company profits from taking locals’ water in practice, its spin is about “matching every litre of water sold with a litre for people in need … to help 50 million people in developing countries access safe drinking water”.

304_gloria_mejias_cinto_cr_tamara_pearson.jpg Gloria Mehias Cinto. Photo: Tamara Pearson

There are some 16,000 water purification and bottling plants in Mexico. The country is the biggest consumer globally of bottled water, though it is worth noting that most bottled water comes in recycled 19-litre containers.

Danone, Coca-Cola and Pepsico dominate the bottled water market nationally, at 82%, while in Puebla state, Nestle Water and US company, Keurig Dr Pepper also profit from the market. Nestle takes water from the springs of the Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl volcanos.

These companies pay, on average, 2600 pesos (AU$168) per year for a concession to extract water.

Depending on the size of the bottle and local water rates, bottled water can be up to 3000 times more expensive than tap water. Treating tap water also involves much less energy than producing or recycling plastic bottles, cleaning them, labelling them and transporting them.

In addition, about six litres of water are used to produce 1.5 litres of bottled water.

It is the profits, rather than “healthy hydration” or the environment that drive this market. Globally, the bottled water market was valued at US$217.66 billion last year and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 11.1% from 2021–28.

Here in Mexico, foreign-owned bottling companies aren’t the only ones leaving locals without water. Thousands of largely US- and European-owned factories and mines benefit from the resource, while contaminating the water supply with total impunity.

A Coca Cola plant in Chiapas, for example, extracts more than 1.14 million litres of water a day, leaving indigenous and poor locals forced to consume the soft drink, as they are left without water, and it is often cheaper and easier to get than bottled water.

Some 60% of the rivers and catchment areas in Mexico are polluted. But with politicians and water and environmental monitoring bodies accepting bribes from foreign and local factories and corporations, and with the pressure from the US via trade agreements to make Mexico as agreeable as possible to foreign companies, it is unlikely the water situation will change soon.

In recent years, the ISS has begun to fall apart, with astronauts now frequently discovering cracks. Last week, it was revealed that Russian cosmonauts were still working on plugging a leak first noticed in 2019. The ongoing problems with the international station have prompted Moscow to begin creating a replacement.

Called ROSS, the Russian orbital satellite will consist of three to seven modules and will be able to carry up to four people. Although only approved by Putin on Monday, on the 60th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin’s landmark first human spaceflight, the project has been in the works for some time. Last November, the first deputy designer general for space contractor RSC Energia revealed his belief that Russia needed to get started on a new station, saying the ISS was already falling apart.

“Until 2025, Russia has obligations to participate in the ISS program,” Vladimir Solovyov told the Russian Academy of Sciences. “There are already a number of elements that have been seriously damaged and are out of service. Many of them are not replaceable. After 2025, we predict an avalanche-like failure of numerous elements onboard the ISS.”

Russia has a long history of making its own satellites, with Sputnik 1 being the first to ever be launched into low Earth orbit, all the way back in 1957. In 1986, the Soviets launched a domestically made space station named Mir, which at the time was the largest artificial satellite in orbit.

Last May, Russian space agency Roscomos revealed that the proposed ROSS could be ready for deployment after 2024.

Despite Moscow’s willingness to go it alone, Roscosmos has reaffirmed its commitment to international cooperation in recent months. Earlier this month, Russia signed off on a plan to continue to collaborate with the US in space, and the two nations are due to use each other’s rockets to head into the cosmos. Roscosmos also signed a moon exploration deal with China in March, with the space agency agreeing to share a lunar station with Beijing.

While space has often been a place for international competition, both Washington and Moscow regularly help each other in times of need. For example, earlier this year, American astronauts donated food to their Russian counterparts when supplies from Earth were delayed.

China's GDP grew by 18.3 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2021, the fastest in three decades, since the data was released, with key economic indicators all expanding at over 20 percent, setting an encouraging start for the year buoyed by a low base, soaring overseas demand and rebounding consumption at home.The stellar data offers a glimpse into the strength of China's economic recovery, which has been retaking lost ground since the second half of 2020. The country is likely to record the highest growth among major economies and make the greatest contribution to the global economy in the first quarter, on top of the US, analysts noted.Looking ahead, China's economy is forecast to keep a stable growth, but may enter ""unchartered waters"" in the second half of the year as geopolitical tensions keep developing and the marginal effect of global economic recovery has weakened.Some analysts are upbeat about China's GDP which might gain by a double-digit growth in the second quarter. For the whole year, the growth rate could reach 9 percent, analysts said, well above the government-set goal of above 6 percent.

In the first three months, China's GDP grew 18.3 percent to 24.9 trillion yuan（$3.82 trillion), compared with a 6.8-percent contraction in the same period last year when the economy came to a standstill amid the coronavirus lockdown.Retail sales soared 33.9 percent, fixed-asset investment jumped 25.6 percent, and industrial production gained by over 24.5 percent, data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Friday.The slew of indicators came in line with estimates, Liu Xuezhi, a senior macroeconomic analyst at Bank of Communications, told the Global Times on Friday.The consumption rally, at a pace apparently faster than the rebound in factory activity, sets the economy for a strong comeback to pre-virus levels, the analyst reckoned.In March alone, retail sales jumped 34.2 percent year-on-year, with the growth rate quickening 0.4 percentage points from the reading for the first two months, per NBS figures.

Industry observers said the data underscores a broadened recovery momentum, particularly in March, which marks a watershed in consumption from ""divergent recovery"" to ""going full swing.""""Millions of Chinese stayed at their working cities during the Spring Festival holidays, coupled with the resurgence of sporadic coronavirus cases, which curbed consumption to some extent in the first two months. With the rollout of a vaccination plan across the country, there was a turnaround in March,"" Lian Ping, head of the Zhixin Investment Research Institute, told the Global Times.""With three minor vacations in the second quarter and consumer confidence being improved, consumption will continue to gain steam in the April-June period,"" Lian added.""The pace of the economic recovery in the second and following quarters would rely more on the recovery of the service sector,"" global asset management giant Fidelity International said in a note sent to the Global Times on Friday.According to domestic travel data during the Qingming Festival in early April, the number of travelers and hotel bookings posted a substantial increase compared with previous holiday breaks, indicating that ""pent-up consumption demand may cause a retaliatory rebound,"" Fidelity International said, stressing more sustainable economic growth is still reliant on the recovery of incomes.In a convincing sign of revenge spending, train tickets to some of the most popular destinations for the upcoming May Day holiday have been sold out the moment they became available, causing platforms to temporarily crash.Analysts also highlighted the role of flooding overseas orders in shoring up China's industrial production acceleration in the first three months.""The global economy seems to be walking out of the pandemic-induced recession, which will boost foreign demand for Chinese merchandise until at least June. This is in contrast to last year, when the recovery of the supply side outpaced that of demand,"" Tian Yun, vice director of the Beijing Economic Operation Association, told the Global Times.Building on the momentum, China will continue to make the biggest contribution to the global economy, serving as an engine of growth for the world. Its gap with the US - the world's largest economy - is expected to further narrow, according to Tian, who expects China's economic scale to overtake that of the US in a decade and usher in a new world economic landscape.In 2020, China's economic volume represented about 70 percent that of the US.In a research note sent to the Global Times on Friday, ICBC International economists Cheng Shi and Wang Yuzhe wrote that the Chinese economy maintained a robust recovery momentum over the past quarter, with the first quarterly expansion reading averaging 5 percent in 2020-21.The Chinese economy's lead over major developed economies, as measured by year-on-year growth, widened again to about 20 percent in the first quarter, an indication of the country's effective virus containment measures, the economists said, expecting China's intrinsically driven economic rebound to continue as the global recovery nears its peak and China's macroeconomic policy avoids a sharp turn.""China is relatively further ahead than most economies in opening up and vaccinating its population. China began by inoculating key groups, including those engaged in handling imported cold-chain products, customs officers, medical workers, and those involved in public transport, to build a first line of immunity against importing the virus,"" Moody's said in an analysis report sent to the Global Times on Friday.The head start is considered to prop up the broader Asia-Pacific region, factoring in its heavy reliance on Chinese demand, according to the rating agency, putting China's GDP growth at 8.2 percent this year.But analysts noted that while China's industrial production has been back to the right track, the growth of fixed-investment and consumption have yet to bounce back to pre-virus levels despite a dramatic improvement from last year.Lian noted that as global supply ability gradually resumed this year, some China-bound commodity orders may experience a withdrawal, or be diverted to other emerging economies, which may impact manufacturing activity.""The GDP growth rates may come down quarter by quarter in 2021, due to the base variation and replacement effect, but it is highly likely that the annual growth rate will be over 10 percent as demands at home keep booming,"" Tian said.In the fourth quarter of 2020, China's GDP grew 6.5 percent year-on-year. For the whole of 2020, its economy expanded by 2.3 percent, the only major economy to achieve a positive growth last year.There are also concerns over the repercussions of rising producer prices on economic growth and the potential headwinds arising from geopolitical uncertainties.But as Liu said, it's not yet the case that inflation rears its ugly head across the board. The country faces a cost-driven structural increase in prices, mainly due to rising commodity prices, such as crude oil, that is being fed through industrial production. It's not domestic demand-fueled price increases and there are no expectations for a substantial rise in asset prices either, according to Liu.He also argued against the impact of external uncertainty on what he described as a domestic demand-buoyed economic recovery.",1167,7542,11,62
0,Russia to close parts of Black Sea near Crimea for six months,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/16/russia-to-close-parts-of-black-sea-near-crimea-for-six-months,"Ukraine and the EU condemn Russia’s decision to restrict the navigation of foreign military and official ships.

Russia will restrict the navigation of foreign military and official ships in parts of the Black Sea until October, according to a Russian news agency, prompting swift condemnation by Ukraine and the European Union.

The announcement on Friday comes amid tensions between Moscow and Kyiv that have escalated in recent weeks after an uptick in fighting between Ukraine’s army and pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine.

Russia has massed its troops along Ukraine’s northern and eastern borders and on the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014. This week Russia also conducted navy drills in the Black Sea.

“From 21:00 on April 24 until 21:00 on October 31, passage through the territorial sea of the Russian Federation for foreign military ships and other state vessels will be halted,” the state-run RIA Novosti news agency cited a defence ministry statement as saying on Friday.

The restrictions will affect the western tip of Crimea, the peninsula’s southern coastline from Sevastopol to Hurzuf, and a “rectangle” off the Kerch peninsula near the Opuksky Nature Reserve.

A senior EU official described the move as a “highly worrying development”.

The move contradicts norms of free maritime passage and international law and adds to tensions around “the military buildup on the other side of the Russian border with Ukraine”, the official told the AFP news agency.

Rising tensions

The official said that the restrictions would increase tensions as Russia was “taking unilateral measures on an international space”.

One of the areas affected by Russia’s restrictions is located near the Kerch Strait, which connects the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov and is of crucial importance for the export of grain and steel from Ukraine.

The Kerch Strait became a scene of confrontation in 2018 after Russia seized three Ukrainian ships there over alleged violations of its territorial waters.

Ukraine had been free to navigate the Kerch Strait along with Russia until 2014, when Moscow claimed full control of the waterway after annexing Crimea.

The Kerch Strait is also the site of a costly 19-km (12-mile) bridge connecting Crimea with mainland Russia that Moscow opened in 2018.

Ukraine’s foreign ministry on Thursday criticised the navigation restrictions, which were initially reported without specifics earlier this week, as a “usurpation of the sovereign rights of Ukraine”.

It also stressed that under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, “Russia must neither obstruct nor halt transit through the international strait to ports in the Sea of Azov.”",428,2702,12,61
0,"Cuba's Raul Castro confirms he's stepping down, says he's 'fulfilled his mission'",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cubas-raul-castro-confirms-stepping-head-communist-party-rcna689,"Raul Castro confirmed Friday he is stepping down as the head of the Communist Party of Cuba, the most powerful position on the island.

During a speech on the first day of the Communist Party's eighth congress, he said he would hand over power to a younger generation that is ""full of passion and anti-imperialist spirit.""

""I believe fervently in the strength and exemplary nature and comprehension of my compatriots, and as long as I live, I will be ready with my foot in the stirrups to defend the fatherland, the revolution and socialism,"" Castro told party delegates at the closed-door meeting at a convention center in Havana.

He was retiring, Castro said, with the sense of having “fulfilled his mission and confident in the future of the fatherland.”

Though there are few expectations of significant change among Cubans, it is however a historic move — Castro and his late brother, Fidel Castro, have been in power since the 1959 revolution.

Though Castro did not name his successor during the speech, it's expected that a subsequent vote will ratify President Miguel Díaz-Canel as the next party secretary-general and set policy guidelines.

Raul Castro had said in 2018 he expected Díaz-Canel to replace him after his retirement in 2021. Díaz-Canel, 60, represents a new generation and is serving the first of two five-year terms as president.

Many analysts believe Castro, who turns 90 in June, will continue to be the most influential figure on the island until his death.

In Cuba, major events are put together during historic celebrations and this year’s congress is no exception. It coincides with the 60th anniversary of the failed, CIA-backed Bay of Pigs invasion.

Castro’s retirement comes as Cuba, one of the last communist run-countries in the world, is facing multiple challenges. Its economy shrank 11 percent in 2020 due to the pandemic, and it's been grappling with tightened U.S. sanctions and a decline in aid from its ally, Venezuela. The government lacks hard currency to import food and medicine, which means endless lines outside stores when food becomes available, and one meal a day for some families.

The country is also dealing with a spike in Covid-19 cases. Strict lockdowns and measures have kept the numbers of cases and deaths below those of most countries in the region, but they have also tested the patience of many Cubans. Cuba has developed five vaccine candidates and two are in late-stage trials.

The country’s challenges have led to public discontent at levels rarely seen since the 1959 communist revolution. Mobile internet has allowed videos of protests to quickly spread among Cubans and also helped activists mobilize. A large protest in November by artists demanding greater freedom of expression made headlines across the globe.

President Joe Biden campaigned on reversing some of the previous administration’s harsh measures, such as limits on remittances and restricted travel to the island by Americans while focusing on human rights. But so far, administration officials have indicated they won’t be making changes anytime soon. Juan Gonzalez, executive director of the National Security Council, said recently that the “political moment” has changed from the Obama administration years and that “oppression against Cubans is worse today than perhaps during the Bush years.”

Disenchantment in the island over the country’s centrally planned system, stagnant economy and decaying infrastructure has been brewing for years, especially among younger Cubans. During the Communist Party’s congress in 2011, a set of ambitious economic reforms were promised that have not been fully implemented.

Victoria Hernández 37, an entrepreneur who sells products such as hangers and batteries in East Havana, says she does not expect much from the congress.

“I think our officials should change their mentality more to improve things. Right now what we’re thinking about is food. I want to also think about having a car, a better house,” she said.

Need for economic reform

But some experts believe Castro's move is important in order to speed up economic reforms. This involves strategic decisions in order to keep the public more content without ceding the tight grip the party has over society.

Arturo López-Levy, a professor at Holy Names University in California, thinks the economic reforms will gain traction once the pandemic is under control.

“What is happening now is a new generation is consolidating control,” he said. “Now they will be forced to make important reforms, because their legitimacy doesn't come from a revolutionary background, but from being capable of showing better performance.”

He said there aren’t high expectations among Cubans because the country “will remain a Leninist system and that basically means the political monopoly of the Communist Party.”

Fabio Fernández, a history professor at the University of Havana, often quoted in the Communist Party newspaper Granma, says it’s important for the party to move forward, fulfill the economic reforms it promised over a decade ago, and make political changes without abandoning its socialist system.

“A new concept of Cuban socialism is what we need to adopt because the old one no longer works,” he said.

Last fall, Syliboy was among the more prominent Mi’kmaq fishers who attempted to launch a self-regulated lobster fishery off southwest Nova Scotia. One of his vessels caught fire at the wharf and was damaged beyond repair.

The federal Fisheries Department says it believes existing law means Sipekne’katik requires a communal licence for fishing snow crab under provisions of the federal Fisheries Act. Spokeswoman Megan Gallant said by email that the band doesn’t have such a licence.

The department says on its website that it retains the right to regulate Indigenous fisheries for conservation purposes under both the Sparrow decision and the more recent Donald Marshall Jr. decision, which allowed Indigenous fishing in pursuit of a moderate livelihood.

Gallant said on Wednesday that fishery officers first warned Syliboy against fishing in an April 6 phone call, and that his snow crab traps were seized the following weekend.

“These operations are part of routine gear inspections by fishery officers to ensure compliance with the Fisheries Act and associated regulations,” she wrote.

Syliboy said he disagrees with the federal interpretation of the Supreme Court’s rulings, arguing he retains the right to operate without a federally approved licence if his band has authorized him to fish.

As the possibility of another season of unrest off southwestern Nova Scotia approaches, the fisher said he believes the enforcement action signals Ottawa will not tolerate self-regulated Indigenous fisheries.

“The (coast guard vessel) was very close to my vessel. It was more intimidation than anything, I think. They were on a 100-foot vessel doing circles around me,” he said.

“I believe it’s getting worse for Mi’kmaq fishers and not better. It’s becoming harder to access waters.”

Syliboy said he would be pleased to go to court and argue against the seizures, as he feels existing judicial rulings support his view.

However, Colin Sproul, a spokesman for the Unified Fisheries Conservation Alliance — a lobby group representing various non-Indigenous, commercial fishers — said Ottawa’s right to regulate remains a key part of Supreme Court of Canada decisions.

“The Sparrow decision is very clear that the right of First Nations are administered through the federal government and the minister, and that she has the ultimate authority for conservation,” he said.

Asked whether setting 10 traps for a community feast poses a conservation issue, Sproul responded, “there is a conservation issue on every single pound of fish taken out of the ocean.” He said all uses of the resource need to be accounted for “so that all the participants can make responsible management decisions.”

Toronto, the country’s largest city, Ottawa, Hamilton, Windsor and at least 19 other municipal police forces said they would not conduct random vehicle or individual stops though they had been given the power to do so.

""The Toronto Police Service will continue to engage, educate and enforce, but we will not be doing random stops of people or cars,"" the force said on Twitter. Mayor John Tory supported the move.

Ontario, home to 38% of Canada's population, had 4,362 new infections on Saturday after a record of 4,812 cases on Friday, and projections indicate the virus could spike to 10,000 per day in June without more strict health restrictions.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford, increasingly under fire for mishandling the province's pandemic response, on Friday gave police the authority to stop anyone driving or walking to ask them to explain their reason for leaving home, and ticket them if in breach of the rules. read more

Steven Del Duca, the opposition Liberal Party leader in Ontario, said Ford was imposing ""martial law"" and that the move was a ""dangerous attack on racialized Ontarians"" who would be unfairly targeted.

The expanded police powers risk causing ""a rash of racial profiling and overbroad police powers, presuming everyone outside guilty until proven otherwise,"" Canada's Civil Liberties Association said.

Ford also said he would block non-essential travel from neighboring provinces from Monday. Ontario's Provincial Police on Saturday said they were preparing to enforce that order.

In recent weeks, Ontario has closed schools, restaurants, limited in-store shopping, and canceled elective surgeries as a surge of admissions threatened to overwhelm hospitals. On Friday it also shut down some construction work, but not warehouses or factories.

Critics say Ford abandoned a previous stay-at-home order too soon, allowing current spike in cases that is putting hospitals under pressure. On Friday, Ford blamed the federal government for the third wave, saying it had been too slow to ramp up vaccinations and too lenient at the borders.

REUTERS/Annegret Hilse/Pool

The COVID-19 pandemic prompted a rise in domestic violence, online fraud and child pornography last year in Germany, although there were fewer break-ins and car thefts as lockdowns kept people at home, police data showed on Thursday.

Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said an overall trend of falling crimes continued last year as 5.3 million offences were reported, one million fewer than in 2017.

""The contact and movement restrictions have had a grave impact on the lives of citizens in Germany,"" Seehofer told a news conference with police chiefs. ""During the lockdowns, life has been taking place largely in the private sphere and this has affected the nature of crime.""

Car theft incidents were down by about 16%, break-ins by 14% and pickpocketing fell by 11%.

This compared with an 11.5% increase in online fraud as criminals tried to cash in on a surge in internet shopping as most retailers shut their doors.

Seehofer said there was a rise in reported domestic violence mainly against women, but did not give any figures as the data was incomplete. He said the reported incidents were most likely only a fraction of the real numbers.

Child pornography crimes rose by more than 54% compared to 2019. The increase was partly the result of Germany receiving more tip-offs on the production, distribution and possession of child pornography from the U.S.-based National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.

0,Angela Merkel gets her AstraZeneca COVID vaccine shot,https://www.dw.com/en/angelamerkel-gets-her-astrazeneca-covid-vaccine-shot/a-57222191,"Unlike many other world leaders, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has not made much of a fuss about the fact that she has now been vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine, made by a British-Swedish manufacturer.

The 66-year-old chancellor received the vaccine at the specially installed center in Berlin's former Tempelhof Airport, which is currently working exclusively with AstraZeneca, a vaccine that is only available to the over-60s in Germany, because of a marginal risk of blood clots. Around 3,000 people a day can currently receive a vaccination there.

The vaccination was announced by her spokesman Steffen Seibert in a post on Twitter, with a simple photo showing her only her vaccination certificate.

Merkel said: ""I am delighted to have received my first vaccination today with AstraZeneca. I thank everyone who is involved in the vaccination campaign — and everyone who gets vaccinated. Vaccination is the key to overcoming the pandemic.""

Waiting her turn

Several times in recent weeks, the chancellor had been forced to answer the question of when she would be getting herself injected, and whether she would be taking AstraZeneca. Her response was always the same: ""When it's my turn, I'll get vaccinated, including with AstraZeneca."" She clearly knows what a sensitive issue the vaccination queue is, especially in Germany.

Politicians in Germany have taken pains to avoid coming across as queue-jumpers, even if there's no reason why they shouldn't be allowed it — as in the case of the chancellor.

German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier also avoided fanfare when he was vaccinated at the beginning of April at a military hospital in Berlin: His office merely issued a photo and a press release, which confirmed that he too had been given the AstraZeneca.

""I trust the vaccines approved in Germany,"" the 65-year-old Steinmeier was quoted as saying. ""Vaccination is a decisive step on the way out of the pandemic. Take advantage of the opportunities, join in.""

In Baden-Württemberg's 72-year-old Premier Winfried Kretschmann, of the Green Party, is so far one of the few German politicians who allowed TV cameras to be used when he was vaccinated in March. He also received the AstraZeneca vaccine and hastened to add that he had confidence in its effectiveness.

AstraZeneca now only for people over 60

Initially, the vaccine from the British-Swedish manufacturer AstraZeneca had only been approved for people under 60 because there was not enough data available for older people in the trials.

But then, a few disturbing reports of isolated incidents of brain thrombosis in vaccinated people, especially among younger women, emerged, and now AstraZeneca is only dispensed to people over the age of 60.

In this context, the chancellor's vaccination was meant as a signal that she continues to back this vaccine despite uncertainties.

At the same time, she is well aware of how quickly debates can arise about whether politicians are using their influence to secure privileges. At the start of the vaccination campaign in December 2020, there were reports of some local politicians who had a vaccine administered ahead of schedule. Bernd Wiegand, mayor of the city of Halle in Saxony-Anhalt, for example, found himself suspended from office after he had himself vaccinated prematurely.

More media attention elsewhere

In other countries, political leaders are much more demonstrative about their own vaccination than Merkel. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had himself vaccinated in March to great media attention, after a spell in hospital with COVID-19 last year.

And new US President Joe Biden, 78, wasn't even in office when he got his COVID vaccination in front of rolling cameras at a hospital in the state of Delaware in December 2020 — though he declined the offer to count to three before the needle of the syringe entered his upper arm.

Merkel appeals to Bundestag for 'emergency brake'

Earlier on Friday, Merkel pleaded with lawmakers to back her in implementing coronavirus lockdowns and curfews on areas with high infection rates.

""The third wave of the pandemic has our country firmly in its grip,"" Merkel said, whose speech was heckled by lawmakers from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The AfD have maintained an anti-lockdown stance throughout the pandemic.

But Merkel said: ""Intensive care workers are sending one distress call after the other. Who are we to ignore their pleas?""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - More than 500 rape cases have been reported to five clinics in Ethiopia's Tigray region, the United Nations said on Thursday, warning that due to stigma and a lack of health services the actual numbers were likely to be much higher.

""Women say they have been raped by armed actors, they also told stories of gang rape, rape in front of family members and men being forced to rape their own family members under the threat of violence,"" Wafaa Said, deputy U.N. aid coordinator in Ethiopia, said in a briefing to U.N. member states in New York.

She said at least 516 rape cases had been reported by five medical facilities in Mekelle, Adigrat, Wukro, Shire and Axum.

""Given the fact that most health facilities are not functioning and also the stigma associated with rape, it is projected that actual numbers are much higher,"" she added.

A dozen top U.N. officials on Monday called for a stop to indiscriminate and targeted attacks against civilians in Tigray, particularly calling out reports of rape and ""other horrific forms of sexual violence.""

Fighting in Tigray broke out in November between government troops and the region's former ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has also said troops from neighboring Eritrea were in the region.

Redwan Hussein, spokesman for the government's emergency task force on Tigray, Billene Seyoum, spokeswoman for the prime minister, Mulu Nega, head of Tigray's interim administration, Eritrea's Foreign Minister Osman Saleh Mohammed and Eritrea's Information Minister Yemane Gebremeskel did not respond to calls and messages requesting comment on the U.N. remarks on Thursday.

The violence in Tigray has killed thousands of people and forced hundreds of thousands from their homes in the mountainous region of about 5 million.

""Most of the internally displaced people left with nothing more than the clothes they were wearing. They are generally traumatized and tell stories of the difficult journey they took in search of safety. Some reported walking for two weeks and some as far as 500km,"" Said said on Thursday.

""Of the people who traveled with them, some were reportedly killed particularly youngsters, people were reportedly beaten, women were subject to rape, some were pregnant and delivered on the way losing their babies,"" she said.

The United Nations has raised concerns about atrocities, while U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has described acts carried out as ethnic cleansing. Ethiopia rejected Blinken's allegation.

This week, Abiy acknowledged for the first time that atrocities such as rape had been committed and said any soldiers committing crimes would be punished.

Dozens of witnesses in Tigray have told Reuters that Eritrean soldiers routinely killed civilians, gang-raped and tortured women and looted households and crops. Eritrea has not responded to queries on reports of atrocities.

0,New Zealand considers phasing out legal sale of tobacco with backdated ban,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/new-zealand-tobacco-smoke-free-2025-b1832495.html,"New Zealand is considering phasing out the legal sale of tobacco with a date-based ban on smoking products.

Lawmakers are mulling plans to gradually increase the legal age at which people can buy tobacco products as New Zealand aims to become smoke-free by 2025.

In a consultation document, the government said: “A smoke-free generation policy would prohibit the sale, and the supply in a public place, of smoked tobacco products to new cohorts from a specified date.

“For example, if legislation commenced on 1 January 2022, then people younger than 18 years at that time or those born after 1 January 2004 would never be able to lawfully be sold smoked tobacco products.”

Associate health minister Dr Ayesha Verrall said a “new approach” to smoking was needed as she warned that “business as usual ... won't get us there”.

The government is also considering a ban on filters, reducing the amount of nicotine in tobacco products and limiting the number of places where they can be bought.

Ministers are also considering setting a minimum price for tobacco products.

New Zealand's Cancer Society welcomed the proposals, saying they would help to reduce inequalities.

It said six shops on average were selling tobacco within a 10-minute walk of New Zealand secondary schools, and that there were four times more tobacco retailers in low-income communities where smoking rates are highest.

“This proposal goes beyond assisting people to quit. The government is demonstrating a commitment to preventing young people from starting to smoke and bring smoking rates down,” its chief executive, Lucy Elwood, said.

“These glaring inequities are why we need to protect future generations from the harms of tobacco,” said Ms Elwood. “Tobacco is the most harmful consumer product in history and needs to be phased out.”

New Zealand's right-wing ACT party criticised the proposals, saying they would disproportionately affect poor people.

“New Zealand smokers who can least afford it will spend more on their habit and in turn do harm to those around them if the government mandates lower nicotine,” the ACT's social development and children spokesperson, Karen Chhour, said in a statement.

Shane Kawenata Bradbrook, an advocate for cutting smoking among the Maori people, said the changes would benefit his community, and that the plan “will begin the final demise of tobacco products in this country”.

Smoking rates are highest among Māori and Pasifika New Zealanders, Mr Bradbrook said.

“For too long the tobacco industry has been addicting our people, fleecing them of their money before we have to bury them in urupa [burial grounds] all over this land,” he added.

“I am looking forward to truly making this a sunset industry in this corner of the world.”

According to the Cancer Society, tobacco smoking is a leading cause of preventable death for the Maori in New Zealand.",550,3489,12,74

At least four people have been killed and 17 others wounded in a car bomb attack in the Sadr City neighbourhood of the Iraqi capital Baghdad, police and medical sources said on Thursday.

The car was parked at a busy second-hand equipment market in the mainly Shia district, police said.

An Iraqi military statement said the blast killed one civilian, wounded 12 others and set several vehicles on fire. Medics in Sadr City put the death toll at four.

Five cars were also destroyed in the blast, the military-linked Security Media Cell reported.

The explosion was caused by an explosive device attached to a parked car at the market, Baghdad police said without providing further details.

Black smoke was rising from the market place and ambulances rushed to save the wounded, Reuters news agency reported, citing witnesses. Police cordoned off the site of the blast shortly afterwards.

Firefighters inspect the site of a car bomb attack in Sadr City district of Baghdad, Iraq April 15, 2021. [Wissam al-Okili/Reuters] There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. It was the second major deadly bombing to hit Baghdad this year after twin suicide attacks claimed by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, or ISIS) fighters killed at least 32 people in a crowded market in January.

Large bomb attacks, once an almost daily occurrence in the Iraqi capital, have halted in recent years since ISIL was defeated in 2017, part of an overall improvement in security that has brought normal life back to Baghdad.

The January blast was the most deadly in three years.

Thursday’s attack comes during an election year, a time when tension between rival Iraqi political groups has often caused violence in the past.

The populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, after whom Sadr city is named and who commands a following of millions of Iraqis, counts among his enemies both ISIL and rival Shia parties with militias backed by Iran.

On Wednesday, separate violence linked to regional rivalries saw an explosives-laden drone target US forces at Iraq’s Erbil airport in northern Iraq and a separate rocket attack kill a Turkish soldier at a military base nearby.

0,Surprise! Mask Wearing Substantially Lowers COVID-19 Rates,https://interestingengineering.com/mask-wearing-lowers-covid-19-rates,"Researchers found a statistical link between high adherence to mask-wearing and lower rates of COVID-19 throughout the United States, according to a study recently published in the journal PLOS ONE.

Mask-wearing is a major factor in lowering COVID-19 rates

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, different states in the U.S. executed disparate policies on mask-wearing, some of which didn't mandate masks at all, while others made them necessary in every public space. Studying the link between mask adherence and COVID-19 rates might help policymakers effectively mitigate stress on healthcare systems, assuage economic instability, and even prevent death.

Charlie Fischer and colleagues at the Boston University School of Public Health in Massachusetts wrote the recent study — which aims to clarify the effects of mask-wearing via analyzing publicly available data on policies related to mask-wearing. The data also included people's self-reported mask-wearing habits, in addition to COVID-19 rates throughout all 50 U.S. States and Washington, D.C.

States showing the lowest adherence rates saw the greatest likelihood of surging COVID-19 rates the following month — an unmistakable pattern. The eight states with at least 75% adherence to mask-wearing guidance saw an average COVID-19 rate of 109.26 per 100,000 residents the following month — but the average COVID-19 rate more than doubled for states with less than 75% adherence, to 239.99 per 100,000.

This latest analysis lends new evidence to the idea of mask-wearing as a major factor in reducing COVID-19 rates. This also means top-down policies and public health moves to lower the spread of COVID-19 infections should always center on improved mask-wearing adherence in every state.

mask-wearing is crucial amid COVID-19 variants

This comes on the heels of an earlier finding from the CDC — which said wearing an additional cloth mask over a surgical mask to form a second layer substantially increases the protective capacities for both wearers and bystanders. The study was first announced during a White House briefing on the coronavirus — where officials emphasized a need for people in the U.S. to wear ""a well-fitting mask"" with at least two layers, according to a report from the New York Times.

With the mounting threat of some coronavirus variants — especially in light of some vaccines' potential ineffectiveness — masks are the only tried-and-true way of lowering the risk of infection with certainty. ""With cases, hospitalizations and deaths still very high, now is not the time to roll back mask requirements,"" said Director CDC Rochelle P. Walensky, in the Times report. ""The bottom line is this: Masks work, and they work when they have a good fit and are worn correctly.""

We're in year two of a global pandemic, and it's unclear if or when the COVID-19 coronavirus will subside this year. Even with the vaccine rollout, it's important, as always, to keep vigilant in closed, public spaces — follow mask-wearing guidelines, and consider doubling-up on masks. Because even if you've received a vaccine, there's no guarantee you've immunity to an already existing or novel mutation of the virus.",500,3186,7,58

0,Lava Jato Hacker Walter Delgatti speaks,https://www.brasilwire.com/lava-jato-hacker-walter-delgatti-speaks/,"Facing a 300 year prison sentence, the man who hacked into chats between Judge Sergio Moro and the Curitiba Lava Jato task-force explains why he did it and why he is disappointed with the Intercept.

By Brian Mier

Walter Delgatti, 31, grew up in a conservative region of Sao Paulo in the mid-sized city of Araraquara. In a recent interview on the Brazilian news portal Brasil 247, he told the story of his life and explained why he decided to hack into the the conversations between members of the Lava Jato task force which have recently been admitted by the Supreme Court as evidence in the US-backed investigation that removed Lula from the 2018 presidential elections at a moment when he was leading in the polls with over double the support of neofacist former Military Dictatorship captain Jair Bolsonaro.

Delgatti developed an early interest in computer games age and got a job working in a LAN house at age 12. As a teenager he started hanging out with a group of friends who got involved in producing parties and concerts, mainly for EDM and Sertanejo, the Brazilian country pop music that is popular with conservatives. Although Sergio Moro and his allies in the Federal Police tried to portray Delgatti as a fanatical Bolsonaro supporter when he was first arrested, he says that although he initially supported the Lava Jato operation because he believed everything he saw in the media at the time, he was always apolitical. To this day, he said, he has never voted in an election.

As his friends music production operations grew, local police began to suspect that they were laundering money based on cash from informal transactions like entry fees to private parties with live music that was circulating through their bank accounts. In 2015, they raided Delgatti’s house and arrested him for allegedly having a fake credit card, but the charges didn’t stick. In 2017 they raided the houses of he and two other members of the production company. Delgatti was imprisoned for possession of illegal narcotics with intent to sell and his photo was posted all over the local news. In the interview for Brasil 247, he said he was framed. The illegal “narcotics” that police found in his house comprised of 3 boxes of the tranquilizer Clonazepam for which he had a prescription, along with anti-depressants, due to anxiety problems he’s had since childhood. In order to make it look like he was dealing the drug, which costs around $3.50 US a box in Brazil, the local media and police announced that he had been arrested with “86” pills – this due to the fact that he had already opened one box of 30 because was taking it nightly for anxiety and insomnia.

At this point, he spent 6 months in jail before being released on a habeas corpus, and his girlfriend dumped him. Delgatti says that she refused to believe his side of the story because there was so much positive news about Lava Jato in the media. On the day she dumped him she told him, “the public prosecutors never lie.”

Shortly afterwards, he was sitting in his court hearing and noticed one of the prosecutors chatting on Telegram. Looking over his shoulder, he managed to ascertain the man’s phone number. At this point, he decided to try to hack into the the prosecutors backup files on the cloud and see what he was saying about his case.

Delgatti does not go into much detail about how he did it, but he said that once you get into one person’s backup archives you can daisy chain through their address book and hack into all of their contacts messages as well. Soon, Delgatti had worked his way through hundreds of accounts, including two Supreme Court justices. After getting into the account of conservative journalist turned Congresswoman, Joice Hassleman, he saw Lava Jato chief prosecutor Delton Dallagnol’s name in her address book and hacked in. From there, he managed to get into the messages from the rest of the Curitiba Lava Jato task-force.

Delgatti says that most of the Lava Jato prosecutors would erase their messages every month or so, so he only had recent conversations from them. Dallagnol, on the other hand, still had 5 years of messages on his phone. Every conversation that he had ever had related to Lava Jato was still in his backup files on the web.

Slicing through the cloud like a hot knife through butter, soon Delgatti had 6 terabytes of conversations between Lava Jato task-force members. In the case of Judge Sergio Moro (who was bizarrely allowed to oversee the Lava Jato investigation, ruling on admissibility of evidence and issuing search warrants and then rule on his own investigation) Delgatti says that he erased his messages every week. However, as he was the real person running the investigation, continually illegally giving out instructions to the prosecutors in a case that he was supposed to rule impartially on, Dallagnol and the rest of the group shared his audio and text messages among themselves. This this is how Delgatti was able to accumulate hundreds of gigabytes of conversations involving Moro.

Delgatti says that at the time he still believed everything he saw on TV about Lava Jato. As he read through the messages, he panicked. “I saw that they were doing the same thing to Lula that they had done to me,” he said.

It was so much information that he only managed to read about 20% of it. This was enough for him to realize that a former President had been the victim of a huge injustice and that Bolsonaro’s election was illegitimate. Terrified that the Federal Police would find him and arrest him at any moment, he decided to figure out a way to go public with the information.

“I got in touch with several important journalists and nobody wanted to have anything to do with it,” he said. “I decided they were all afraid and that maybe I could convince someone who was living outside of Brazil to get involved.” He immediately thought of Jean Wyllys, Brazil’s first openly gay Congressman, who had resigned and fled Brazil with help from Brown University Professor James Green after receiving a series of death threats from Rio de Janeiro paramilitary militias connected to the Bolsonaro family.

Slicing through address book after address book, he managed to hack into the account of Rio Grande do Sul State Congresswoman and 2018 communist party Vice Presidential candidate Manuela d’Ávila, who is a friend of Wyllys. Posing as d’Ávila, he sent a series of messages to Wyllys, but was ignored. At this point, d’Ávila noticed she was being hacked and started talking to Delgatti. He explained what was going on, and she suggested intermediating with Glenn Greenwald for him.

Communist Porto Alegre State Congresswoman Manuela d’Ávila, a former journalist, played a key role introducing the hacker to Glenn Greenwald.

Greenwald asked to look at a selection of the leaks and Delgatti forwarded him a 57 gigabyte selection of the conversations. At this point, the Intercept, in partnership with a group of conservative media outlets like Veja and Folha de Sao Paulo that supported the 2016 coup against Dilma Rousseff, began publishing a series of articles based on the leaks. The Intercept articles revealed important information that clearly demonstrates illegal collusion between the judge and prosecutors. They show how Judge Sergio Moro gave instructions to the prosecution about what information should be leaked to what reporters in what TV networks and newspapers, in order to damage Lula’s public image during the lead up to the trial. The articles show prosecutors talking about praying to God that Bolsonaro win the presidential elections. They show that, even on the day of the final trial, they knew they had no evidence against Lula but that Moro was going to “take care of it” for them. They show prosecutors bragging about allies in the Supreme Court who would help open an exception to the Constitution and jail former President Lula for charges of “undetermined acts of corruption”, with no material evidence, 5 months before the presidential elections for which he was the leading candidate. The leaks were published slowly and selectively starting in June, 2019. Intercept refused to share its entire body of leaks with the public. It wouldn’t be until the 96th article in March 2020, after Lula had already been released from jail and the Covid Pandemic was taking up all of the headlines in the Brazilian media, that Intercept would release the first conversations about US involvement in Lava Jato, later helping smaller media outlet Agencia Publica reveal that a group of 18 FBI agents led by Leslie Backshies met with Lava Jato prosecutors every two weeks for several years, including during the period they were making their case against Lula.

Delgatti said that he now has mixed feelings about Greenwald and the Intercept. “I only sent the Intercept 57 gigabytes of the conversations from Lava Jato and after this, Glenn refused to take any more of it. He said, ‘no. What I already have is already going to give us enough material for 1 year of articles. It’s a lot of stuff. I have a year’s worth of articles,’ and he didn’t want any more of it. I had a lot more information and he didn’t want it. Now, he has released very little of what he received. To this day I don’t understand why. I haven’t spoken to him about it. I don’t know if, after the Attorney Generals office filed those charges against him that were later dropped, he might have felt pressured to pause things a little bit. I don’t know because I haven’t had any contact with him, but I see that he has released very little so far. I like the way he has contextualized the things he has published and I thank him for this, but I see that he has really just been publishing these leaks drop by drop and he hasn’t shared everything he’s received. I don’t know the motive for this. The fact is I sent him so much and he hasn’t ended up sharing it. The truth is, I feel a little disappointed and don’t understand why he did this.”

The maximum prison sentence in Brazil for hacking into a smartphone is 1 year, but through a loophole in the law, the Attorney General’s Office is threatening Delgatti with 300 consecutive prison sentences of one year each. When asked how he feels about it, he says that if he could do everything over again he would. “Even if I have to spend the rest of my life behind bars, it will be worth it to me because I know I have contributed something positive for democracy in this country. I believe strongly in this, this is why I didn’t charge the Intercept for the information.”

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has turned over 30 times more information than what was received by the Intercept – 20% of the total volume of leaks – to Lula’s defense team, and more and more evidence beneficial to the defense is coming out daily, much involving illegal collaboration with US Government officials beyond the terms of the partnership agreement. This has already resulted in a motion to drop charges due to violation of Brazil’s sovereignty laws. A recent leak revealed by the defense team shows Lava Jato chief Delton Dallagnol, on the day of Lula’s imprisonment, referring to it as a gift from the CIA. Now that Intercept has lost its monopoly over the Lava Jato leaks, time will tell whether it deliberately sat on evidence beneficial to the defense team of a former President during his unjust political imprisonment in what was recently referred to in a New York Times op ed piece as, the biggest legal scandal in Brazilian history.

But he couldn't account for the coronavirus forcing royal planners to scale back the event.

Still, hundreds of mourners and well-wishers ignored public health advice to stay home due to Covid-19 restrictions, flocking to Windsor Castle to pay their final respects to the queen's consort, who died at age 99.

""I know they told us to stay away but we haven't,"" said Fiona Oldham, 53, an admin worker who traveled from near Blackpool in northwest England with her friends. ""I'm a real royalist — I absolutely love them.""

Oldham, who also attended the London funeral of Princess Diana in 1997, described Philip as a ""character"" and the ""power behind the throne"" of Queen Elizabeth II, offering his loyalty to the now-bereaved sovereign.

Like many gathered in Windsor, she was also keen to see Princes William and Harry together during the ceremonial procession Saturday, lamenting Harry's stateside move.

""We miss him. ... I'm hoping that the queen burns his passport,"" she said, chuckling. ""We feel that he's ours.""

Inside the castle, the royal family was honoring Philip's life and service to the queen, to whom he was married for 73 years. Military musicians outside St. George’s Chapel maintained a certain distance from each other, while inside just four choristers sang and 30 members of Philip's family wore masks. The queen sat alone and at a remove from the other attendees.

Outside the ancient castle's walls, Isabelle Wallace, a teacher from France, said she could not stay away.

""I'm a bit naughty. ... I think it's something to witness,"" Wallace, 50, said.

""My husband is Scottish and quite anti-royal — he's bald and he's washing his hair today,"" she added, acknowledging not everyone in Britain shared her royalist sentiments.

Wallace said she also couldn't ignore ""stories of his racism,"" referring to previous public remarks by the outspoken Philip, but added he'd done a lot for young people and the environment.

The Duke of Edinburgh was interred in a royal vault close to historic English kings such as Henry VIII and George VI, the queen's father, on Saturday. The funeral was organized by Philip, with hand-picked music, prayers and a specially adapted Land Rover hearse to carry his coffin.

The royal family has not been immune to the impacts of the virus either, with Prince Charles testing positive in March 2020. Both the queen and her late husband had also been vaccinated, according to Buckingham Palace.

Wandering around the busy town, Kaya Mar, 64, carried a large painting he'd made of Philip, calling it a tribute to his life.

""He's done a lot for this country and he was the glue for the royal family,"" Mar said. The painter, who traveled from London, added that Greek-born Philip hadn't had it easy in the royal establishment as ""an outsider.""

The queen, 94, who has called her husband her ""strength and stay,"" struck as a lonely figure sitting unaccompanied in St. George's Chapel.

Millions are expected to tune in from across the globe to the televised but muted funeral.

Many will take an interest from Commonwealth nations — a collection of mostly former British colonies — where the queen remains ceremonial head of state for some.

Matthew Callender remembers the excitement of seeing the queen and Philip in Barbados as a schoolchild in 1977. Now, working as head doorman at a Windsor hotel in the shadow of the castle, he said many back home would be sad.

""He was loved in Barbados and the Commonwealth because of his cheeky character; he was just a funny man,"" he said, holding the door.

Barbados, along with Jamaica, recently expressed interest in becoming a republic. But Callender said despite the politics, the queen and her late husband ""will always be loved.""",692,4153,11,68

This is America’s team, and Cowboys is just so generic. But Redskins has punch, it means something, it symbolizes the values of this country, and that is what I want for my team. I’m just pissed we couldn’t get the rights to Chief Wahoo, too.” At press time, Jones had released market research suggesting that merchandise emblazoned with the Redskins logo would sell more than four times better in Texas than Cowboys apparel.

1,"Three Fingered On Class Trip To Washington, D.C.",https://local.theonion.com/three-fingered-on-class-trip-to-washington-d-c-1819570712,"WASHINGTON—Less than 24 hours into their class trip to Washington D.C., ninth-graders from Middleton Junior High School are reporting that three of their female classmates have been fingered.

Those students whose fingerings have been confirmed include 14-year-old Lacy DeWitt, 15-year-old Jamie Cavanaugh, and freshman class president Kelly Oswald.

Two-thirds of the fingerings occurred before the freshman class reached the National Museum of Natural History.

Rumors of a fourth fingering remain unsubstantiated, though students noted that during Friday's showing of Cosmic Collisions at the National Air and Space Museum, Brian Rupp and Laura Burkholder sat in the back of the planetarium far away from chaperones.

Burkholder was reportedly wearing a skirt at the time.

""We expect our students to be on their best behavior here in Washington,"" said vice principal Tom Molinaro, who is known to often fall asleep during bus rides, thus increasing the chances of a fingering taking place. ""Remember, we're representing our school here.""

According to students, the first fingering occurred Thursday at 8:32 a.m., when Jared Geyer, using a Middleton Football hooded sweatshirt for cover, fingered girlfriend Lacy DeWitt roughly 90 minutes into the six-hour trip to the nation's capital.

""I knew Jared was fingering her,"" classmate Matt Shearer told reporters. ""They were laughing with each other and then they got real quiet.""

Added Shearer, ""Before the trip Jared said he was going to finger her.""

The second fingering reportedly took place Thursday night at the hotel after chaperones failed to notice that Nick Stern had been hiding in Jamie Cavanaugh's bathroom during a 10 p.m. room check. After the two chaperones left, Stern exited the bathroom and proceeded to finger Cavanaugh from approximately 10:13 p.m. to 10:17 p.m.

Kelly Oswald, recipient of the trip's third confirmed fingering, was fingered by Greg Wandel on Friday behind the FDR Memorial.

While the official count remains at three, students speculated that as many as 20 of their classmates have been or will be fingered before the trip's end. However, ninth-grade sources have ruled out any chance of 15-year-old Emily Blankenship being fingered, felt up, or even touched, for that matter.

""I guarantee Dave Hilland will finger Jessica Swink,"" Geoff Schroyer told reporters, adding that Hilland fingered Swink during last summer's whale-watching trip in Boston. ""If not tonight, then definitely during the bus ride back. Either way, he'll finger her.""

In addition to those who could be getting fingered at this very moment, four other students have reportedly been the object of attempted fingerings, one of which was interrupted when a chaperone entered the railcar exhibit at the Holocaust Memorial Museum. According to Jason Schilling, there was no actual finger insertion, though contact with pubic hair was made.

Others who have been implicated in alleged fingerings include Allison Maida, whose whereabouts between 3:30 p.m. and 3:45 p.m. Friday remain unknown.

""She was probably getting fingered,"" Joey Ross, 14, said.

When last available for comment, students said that Michael Biller and Carrie Washburn had stayed behind as their tour group left a monument—the name of which they could not recall—and that the situation would likely end with Washburn being ""finger slammed.""

""I think these trips are so important because they get the kids out of their little bubble back at school,"" said chaperone and ninth-grade history teacher Heidi DeWitt, whose daughter has been fingered twice during the excursion. ""Washington, D.C. is such an amazing city. I'm sure this will be an experience these kids will never forget.""",583,3814,8,48

Cyber intrusions, interference in democratic processes and the build-up of military forces near the Ukrainian border and in illegally annexed Crimea were among the reasons the Foreign Office said it had summoned Andrei Kelin.

On Thursday, Joe Biden said he was imposing sanctions on Russia for interference in the 2020 presidential election and a cyberattack on the American government and corporate networks.

The US formally named Russia's foreign intelligence service as the perpetrator of the SolarWinds cyberattack last year in which more than 40 US government organisations, including federal agencies, and those with government contracts were hacked.

Some of the victims were outside the US, including in the UK, Belgium, Canada, Israel, Mexico, Spain and the UAE.

Today, Sir Philip Barton, permanent under-secretary at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), ""made clear"" to Mr Kelin the UK supports those sanctions, a spokesman said.

""The UK government is deeply concerned about a pattern of malign behaviour by the Russian state,"" he added.

Sir Philip told the Russian ambassador the UK has also assessed the Russian Intelligence Services ""were behind the SolarWinds compromise"".

The FCDO said the impact in the UK had been assessed by the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) - part of GCHQ - as ""low"" with a ""low single-digit number"" of public sector bodies having been targeted.

It said the government had been working with the affected organisations to ensure they were ""rapidly mitigated"".

Sir Philip also told Mr Kelin the UK will ""continue to work with our allies to call out and counter malign operations by the Russian Intelligence Services"".

""Sir Philip also stated the UK's concern at the build-up of Russian military forces near the Ukrainian border and illegally-annexed Crimea,"" the FCDO spokesman said.

""These activities are threatening and destabilising. Russia needs to cease its provocations and de-escalate tensions in line with its international obligations.""

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK and US were determined to stand together against Russia's ""malign behaviour"".

""We see what Russia is doing to undermine our democracies,"" he said.

Image: Russia was responsible for the SolarWinds cyber attacks, the UK said

Ten Russian embassy staff are being expelled by the US as part of the executive order, including Russian intelligence members.

Thirty-two entities and individuals were also sanctioned for ""carrying out Russian government-directed attempts to influence the 2020 US presidential elections, and other acts of disinformation and interference"", the US Treasury said.

Mr Biden's administration said it is also ""responding to reports that Russia encouraged Taliban attacks against US and coalition personnel in Afghanistan"".

An official said US intelligence agencies had ""low to moderate confidence"" in reports Russia offered to pay bounties for dead American troops.

Russia's foreign ministry summoned US ambassador John Sullivan to its Moscow offices less than an hour after the sanctions were announced.

Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign ministry's spokeswoman, said Russia would give ""a decisive rebuff"" to the ""aggressive behaviour"" by the US.",557,3699,16,92

A magnitude 5.9 earthquake has struck Iran’s southern province of Bushehr, where a nuclear power plant is located, but there were no immediate reports of considerable damage.

At least five people were injured, Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency reported. The epicentre of the earthquake on Sunday was the town of Rig.

Hospitals in nearby cities and provinces were put on alert with rescue teams and 50 ambulances sent to the area, a regional official told state TV.

Electricity and landline telephone and internet in the regional city of Gonaveh were cut off “and people are taking to the streets for fear of earthquakes”, semi-official news agency Tasnim reported.

An Iranian government official told Reuters news agency there were no reports of damage at the Bushehr nuclear complex, situated on Iran’s Gulf coast.

The earthquake was centred 100km (60 miles) away from the plant and was relatively shallow – only 10km (6 miles) deep, according to Iranian media which also reported nine aftershocks and posted pictures that showed collapsed mud-brick walls in some villages.

Two people were injured in Gonaveh and were being taken to hospital, state media quoted the head of the Bushehr University of Medical Sciences, Saeed Kashmiri, as saying.

The French embassy in Islamabad on Thursday advised all French nationals in Pakistan to temporarily leave the country after violent protests by a radical religious group that has now been banned by the government.

The Tehreek-i-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) took to streets on Monday to launch violent protests to force the government to expel the French ambassador over blasphemous caricatures published last year.

Though no French citizen was reportedly targeted so far but the embassy has urged all the French citizens to leave Pakistan, apparently as a precautionary measure.

“Due to the serious threats to French interests in Pakistan, French nationals and French companies are advised to temporarily leave the country,” the embassy said in an email message to its citizens in Pakistan.

It said that the departures will be carried out by existing commercial airlines.

Interior minister Sheikh Rashid announced on Wednesday to ban the TLP and officials said that Prime Minister Imran Khan and his cabinet endorsed the summary by the interior ministry to outlaw the group.

The trouble began after police arrested the TLP chief Saad Rizvi on Monday ahead of the April 20 deadline by the group to expel the French ambassador.

The issue of expulsion of the ambassador was linked to an agreement between the TLP and the government when the former in November last year postponed its protest against publication of blasphemous cartoons.

Initially, the government had agreed that it would take action to fulfill the demand of expulsion of the French ambassador by February but later on the two sides agreed to set April 20 as the new deadline.

However, when Rizvi was arrested the TLP in coordinated protests blocked main roads in all major cities and the protests turned violent when police tried to remove them.

After efforts of more than two days, the government has succeeded to clear the roads and restore traffic but French embassy issued an advisory for its citizens. Speaking to Dawn.com, the embassy’s press attache Veronique Wagner, said “We can confirm that we have sent a precautionary note to all our citizens in Pakistan advising them to temporarily leave the country if possible due to the recent protests that have caused graver security threats and put its citizens at risk.” She added, however, that the embassy has not been closed but was working with limited staff.",415,2573,16,105

1,Archaeological Dig uncovers Ancient Race of Skeleton People,https://www.theonion.com/archaeological-dig-uncovers-ancient-race-of-skeleton-pe-1819565415,"AL JIZAH, EGYPT—A team of British and Egyptian archaeologists made a stunning discovery Monday, unearthing several intact specimens of “skeleton people”—skinless, organless humans who populated the Nile delta region an estimated 6,000 years ago.

An archaeologist examines the intact remains of a spooky “skeleton person.”

“This is an incredible find,” said Dr. Christian Hutchins, Oxford University archaeologist and head of the dig team. “Imagine: At one time, this entire area was filled with spooky, bony, walking skeletons.”

“The implications are staggering,” Hutchins continued. “We now know that the skeletons we see in horror films and on Halloween are not mere products of the imagination, but actually lived on Earth.”

Standing at the excavation site, a 20-by-20-foot square pit along the Nile River, Hutchins noted key elements of the find. “The skeletons lived in this mud-brick structure, which, based on what we know of these people, was probably haunted,” he said. “Although we found crude cooking utensils in the area, as well as evidence of crafts like pottery and weaving, we are inclined to believe that the skeletons’ chief activity was jumping out at nearby humans and scaring them. And though we know little of their language and means of communication, it is likely that they said ‘boogedy-boogedy’ a lot.”

Approximately 200 yards west of the excavation site, the archaeologists also found evidence of farming.

“What’s puzzling about this,” Cambridge University archaeologist Sir Ian Edmund-White said, “is that skeletons would not benefit from harvested crops, as any food taken orally would immediately fall through the hole behind the jaw and down through the rib cage, eventually hitting the ground. Our best guess is that they scared away a group of human farmers, then remained behind to haunt the dwelling. Or perhaps they bartered goods in a nearby city to acquire skeleton accessories, such as chains, coffins and tattered, dirty clothing.”

Continued Edmund-White: “The hole in that theory, however, is that a 1997 excavation of this area which yielded extensive records of local clans and merchants made no mention of even one animated mass of bones coming to town for the purpose of trade. But we are taking great pains to recover as much of the site as possible, while also being extremely careful not to fall victim to some kind of spooky skeleton curse.”

As for what led to the extinction of the skeletons, Edmund-White offered a theory.

“Perhaps an Egyptian priest or king broke the curse of the skeletons, either by defeating the head skeleton in combat or by discovering the magic words needed to send their spirits back to Hell,” Edmund-White said. “In any case, there is strong evidence that the Power of Greyskull played a significant role in the defeat of the skeleton people.”

According to Hutchins, the skeletons bear numerous similarities to humans, leading him to suspect that there may be an evolutionary link between the two species.

“Like humans, these creatures walked upright on two legs and possessed highly developed opposable thumbs,” Edmund-White said. “These and many other similarities lend credence to the theory that hundreds of thousands of years ago, human development passed through a skeletal stage. These skeletons may, in fact, be ancestors of us all.”

“Any of us could be part skeleton,” he added.

Other experts disagreed.

“The evidence of an evolutionary link between humans and skeletons is sparse at best,” said Dr. Terrance Schneider of the University of Chicago. “Furthermore, it is downright unscientific to theorize that skeleton life originated in Egypt merely because mummies, another species of monster, are indigenous to the area. Spooky creatures are found all over the world, from the vampires of Transylvania to the headless horsemen of Sleepy Hollow.”",627,3979,8,59

Incredibly, though, we failed to pick up on this little Easter egg until today: You can actually press L3 to have a nice conversation with the game’s bosses and enemies. And you know what, gamers? It turns out that they’re all pretty nice.

That’s right! Like us, you may have found yourself bashing your head against the wall struggling to defeat lumbering Penetrators or relentless waves of Silver Skeletons. But if you just choose to holster your Battle Axe, you can instead casually chat with these enemies about what they’re up to this weekend or where to grab a good burrito in the Valley of Defilement. Turns out, if you just act like a nice guy—instead of a bloodthirsty maniac—every “enemy” in the game will simply let you pass without so much as lifting a finger.

“ Don’t judge a book by its cover” is really the name of the game in Demon’s Souls.



Put simply, most gamers have been completely misreading the aggressive body language and menacing appearance of Demon’s Souls enemies. While so many of us instinctively drew our weapons as a Red Eye Knight charged our way, the truth is they just want to talk to you about your favorite entry in the Mission Impossible franchise. Admittedly, it’s banal and can get pretty boring after the Knight keeps telling you that Philip Seymour Hoffman’s performance in MI:III is underappreciated. But by simply trying to have a conversation instead of killing these supposed adversaries, you’ll find out you have a lot more in common with them than you initially thought.



One neat feature is that there’s actually a whole dialogue wheel system, if you hold down L3 for five seconds or so. By utilizing the “joke” and “charm” options in succession we actually found out we share a love of amateur photography with the Storm King and went out on a nice date with him in the Shrine of Storms. It didn’t go anywhere, romantically, but it really makes us wonder what we’ve missed out on by being so dismissive in the past.



So there you have it, gamers! It turns out many of Demon’s Souls creatures share the same values we have, and yet we’ve been murdering them indiscriminately for over a decade. Frankly, we feel terrible about killing so many of them. But for anyone who loves Soulsborne games, we can’t think of a better reason to jump back in and replay this classic from the very beginning!",452,2600,22,117

European shares are expected to inch higher, with Euro Stoxx futures up 0.1% and Britain's FTSE futures slightly higher.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) was last up 0.25%, with Shanghai shares (.SSEC) adding 0.6%. Japan's Nikkei (.N225)ticked up 0.1%.

MSCI's broadest gauge of world stocks (.MIWD00000PUS) ticked up 0.05% by late Asian trade, staying just below Thursday's record peak.

""Markets look ahead to economic normalisation as vaccines will go around. Stock prices are likely to rise gradually while looking at upcoming earnings,"" said Tomo Kinoshita, global market strategist at Invesco Asset Management in Tokyo.

Markets in Asia were largely steady after China reported record 18.3% growth in the first quarter, though the reading slightly undershot expectations, while retail sales bounced strongly last month.

The data did little to change the view that its brisk expansion is expected to moderate later this year as the government turns its attention to reining in financial risks in overheating parts of the economy.

""Regulators might make further efforts to cool down the property market and control domestic leverage. Fiscal discipline might also be strengthened, leading to deceleration in local government financing and infrastructure investment,"" said Chaoping Zhu, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management in Shanghai.

Data from the U.S. overnight was also upbeat, with retail sales rebounding 9.8% in March, pushing the level of sales 17.1% above its pre-pandemic level to a record high.

The brightening economic prospects were underscored by other data, including first-time claims for unemployment benefits tumbling last week to the lowest level since March 2020.

""The U.S. recovery looks really strong. And now that restaurants and hotels, both of which are labour intensive, are reopening, we could see sharp gains in payrolls in coming month,"" said Koichi Fujishiro, senior economist at Dai-ichi Life Research.

Despite strong data, U.S. bond yields dropped, in part driven by Japanese buying, as they have began a new financial year this month.

The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield dropped to 1.529%, a five-week low, on Thursday and last stood at 1.578% , off its 14-month high of 1.776% set at the end of March.

""The market has already fully priced in an U.S. economic recovery in the near term. And if the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates on hold for the next two to three years, no doubt the carry of U.S. bonds would be very attractive compared with Japanese or euro zone bonds,"" said Chotaro Morita, chief fixed income strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities.

The fall in long-term bond yields benefited stocks, and particularly tech shares, given the idea that their historically expensive valuations can be justified because investors would have no choice but to buy shares to make up for low returns from bonds.

On Wall Street, the S&P 500 (.SPX) advanced 1.11% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 1.31%, nearing its record peak set in February.

In the currency market, lower U.S. yields were a drag on the U.S. dollar.

The euro stood at $1.1951 , having hit a six-week high of $1.19935 overnight while the U.S. currency slipped to a three-week low of 108.61 yen and last traded at 108.89.

Gold also hit a seven-week high of $1,769 per ounce and last stood at $1,765.50.

Oil prices hit one-month highs on higher demand forecasts from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and OPEC, in addition to positive U.S. and Chinese data.

Brent futures gained 0.6% at $67.37 per barrel, while U.S. crude rose 0.55% to 63.81 per barrel, both on course for their first substantial weekly gains in six.

“Since there is now no Jew living in Tripoli and since the power is in the hands of the local authorities (read: Militias) it was decided to violate our property and our history,” he wrote. “The plan clearly is to take advantage of the chaos and our absence.”

Gerbi said The World Organization of Jews in Libya “calls for this transformation to be stopped immediately and to leave the Tripoli synagogue intact with the hope that one day it will be restored.”

Contacts on the ground provided Gerbi with pictures and videos over the past three months that have convinced him that the synagogue is being taken over illegally, he said

The central government in Libya, a former colony of Italy in northern Africa, has collapsed since the 2011 overthrow and execution of dictator Muammar Gaddafi, who had ruled the country with an iron fist since 1969. The revolution sparked intermittent fighting between clans and militias with competing claims to leadership.

Libya once had about 40,000 Jews, who left following the establishment of the State of Israel.

1,Deformed Freak Born Without Penis,https://www.theonion.com/deformed-freak-born-without-penis-1819575921,"The utterly disfigured creature, who sources say somehow has to make its way through life with no male genitalia whatsoever.

NORFOLK, VA—In an alarming case that has baffled and repulsed many, sources confirmed Tuesday that a severely deformed freak born without a penis has managed to live with the condition for over 26 years.

Advertisement

The bizarre, monstrous human specimen was reportedly born with no other noticeable maladies and has, amazingly enough, attempted to lead a normal, albeit severely impaired life despite possessing no male genitalia whatsoever.

“We first noticed something was off about three months into the pregnancy, and I was of course horrified,” said Dr. Mark Joules, the obstetrician who delivered the grotesque—some would say subhuman—abhorrence of nature. “You could clearly see in the ultrasound that a penis and testicles were not developing as one would hope—or at all, in fact—and we immediately knew something was terribly, terribly wrong.”

“Had we caught it earlier, we most likely would have recommended that the pregnancy be terminated,” Joules continued. “But it was unfortunately too late at that point, so we were forced to deliver the baby as planned and just pray that it could get by in that state. We did our best, but with such a horrible and incredibly crippling deformity, there wasn’t much hope to be had.”

According to reports, the sadly disfigured 26-year-old’s quality of life has been greatly diminished due to such a condition. Sources said the abnormal, visibly blemished creature has been repeatedly passed over for employment opportunities, frequently gawked at and harassed on the street by total strangers, and has faced near constant discrimination for over two decades, all due to the horrific and debilitating birth defect.

Indeed, many are reportedly unable to look past the glaring deformity and simply see the 26-year-old as a human being.

“Whoa, look at that,” said 31-year-old onlooker Grant Megson, who, like many others, gawked at the freakish human anomaly while passing by on the sidewalk. “I don’t mean to stare, but honestly, it’s hard not to. Jesus Christ.”

“I just wish some of my buddies were here to see this,” added Megson, smiling and taking one last look before continuing with his day.

Sources confirmed that, unfortunately, such cases are actually quite common, with roughly one in every two babies afflicted with the lifelong disfigurement.

However, that is reportedly little consolation to the malformed specimen’s father, who told reporters that a day doesn’t go by in which he doesn’t wish his child was born a normal, healthy baby with male genitalia.

“Sadly, because the deformity is so obvious, our child was treated very differently from all the other kids,” the father told reporters, admitting that he was incredibly upset and disappointed when he first learned that his baby would be born a freak, one to be mistreated and viewed as inferior its whole life. “Even though the doctors explained all the incredible challenges and prejudice the poor thing would face, I don’t think it really sunk in until after the birth, when I saw the disfigurement with my own eyes. You never want your child to have to grow up that way.”

0,Philippines seizes fossilized giant clam shells worth $25 million,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/17/asia/fossilized-clam-shells-seized-intl-scli/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_latest+%28RSS%3A+CNN+-+Most+Recent%29,"(CNN) The Philippines is shell-ebrating after it seized more than 150 tons of fossilized giant clams Friday worth nearly $25 million.

As part of a joint operation, the Philippine coast guard found the shells, known locally as ""taklobo"", on the shores of Sitio Green Island, in the western Palawan province, it said in a Facebook post. The haul was worth ₱1.2 billion (around $24.8 million).

It is the biggest illegal giant clam shell haul in the region, according to the coast guard's Palawan commander, Commodore Genito Basilio.

The law enforcement team arrested four suspects, accusing them of violating the Philippine Wildlife Resources Conservation and Protection Act . Article 27 of the Act says it's unlawful for someone to ""willfully and knowingly exploit wildlife resources and their habitats"" for a number of reasons, including trading the wildlife or for the purposes of collection.

Anyone who kills or destroys wildlife species categorized as threatened could face two years in prison or a fine of ₱20,000 ($410), according to the Act.

The Palawan Council for Sustainable Development (PCSD), which also took part in the operation alongside intelligence groups such as the Australian Federal Police, said in a statement Saturday it questioned a member of the group taking the clams, Rosalee Tequillo.

""PCSDS' [sic] discussion with Dra. Tequillo resulted in learning that she and her group are engaged in the collection and possession of Giant Clam species for commercial purposes without legal authority,"" the statement said.

Tequillo claimed she had permission from the Philippine president's office and the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) to collect the shells, said the PCSD, adding that Tequillo had no documents to prove this.

President Rodrigo Duterte's office, the BFAR and the PCSD did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

""A certain group of individuals"" was spreading the false rumor that the PCSD and the BFAR were allowing the collection of taklobo, said the PCSD in a statement on April 13.

The giant clams help maintain marine wildlife by sheltering some animals and stopping too much algae growth, according to CNN affiliate CNN Philippines

Tequillo also asserted the suspected group had a ""treasure hunting permit,"" but the giant clams are not covered by this, according to the PCSD. The mollusks can only be collected for taxonomic purposes and not for commerce, it added.

Teodoro Jose S. Matta, the PCSD's executive director, emphasized in Saturday's statement that the body, which is responsible for regulating the Wildlife Act in Palawan, would ""remain firm in the commitment to clamp down on illegal wildlife trading.""

In a separate statement released on Saturday the PCSD called on local fishers and citizens to abstain from collecting and commercially trading the shells and other threatened wildlife.

This seizure is one of a number of similar incidences in recent months. Alongside the Philippine coast guard and other groups, the PCSD seized 324 pieces of giant clam shells worth ₱160 million on Johnson Island on March 3, following a similar discovery in October.",498,3143,9,65

It could be a statement comparing all refugees to the 9/11 hijackers, or one that describes liberal judges as enemies of the Constitution bent on removing all our freedoms—regardless, I have complete confidence that between now and Election Day, something he says will just click and set me on an irreversible course of action.” The deeply troubled individual added that if Trump were to ever direct a bitter comment toward women who use Planned Parenthood services, that might be just the ticket.",245,1483,13,79
0,Police killing hundreds in Rio de Janeiro despite court ban on favela raids | Global development,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/apr/18/police-kill-hundreds-rio-de-janeiro-favela-raids-court-ban,"Nearly 800 people were killed by police in the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro in the past nine months, as raids remain a terrifying routine for favela families – despite a supreme court ruling to halt incursions during the coronavirus pandemic.

New figures show that between June 2020 and March 2021, 797 people were killed in Rio state, 85% in the city of Rio and surrounding metropolitan region.

The court ruled to suspend police raids in Brazilian favelas in June 2020, amid public outcry following the death of 14-year-old João Pedro Matos Pinto, who was shot in the back during a police incursion.

Between June and September, police raids plummeted 64% compared with the average for the same period in previous years, according to a report by Geni, a research group at the Federal Fluminense University (UFF).

But incursions resumed in October, one month after the acting governor, Cláudio Castro, took office and rapidly doubled to 38 in October, compared with the previous month. In the following nine months, the communities of Greater Rio saw an average of nearly one raid every day, the report showed.

“It’s absurd,” Daniel Hirata, an author of the report and professor of sociology at UFF, said. “The highest court takes a decision, and political authorities do not respect it, violate it deliberately. This is a risk to the rule of law in Brazil.”

On Friday, the state supreme court started a two-day public hearing on police raids to draw up a new plan to reduce police killings and human rights violations.

Police in Rio de Janeiro state, kill almost twice as many people each year as they do in the US. Most of the victims are black and brown.

A police spokesmen said the raids were launched in response to violent disputes for territory between warring gangs, and claim that they focus on “preserving lives and following strict legal precepts”.

But Hirata argued that “police raids, in addition to being lethal, are ineffective against crime”, and the report shows that such actions are not associated with any reduction in criminal activity.

A surge in police violence came after the 2018 election as Rio governor of Wilson Witzel, who had campaigned on a promise to “slaughter” criminals. Witzel was forced from office in late August 2020 after a corruption scandal, but his acting successor has pursued a similar frontal assault on drug gangs – and ordinary civilians are caught in the crossfire.

Police violence has also compounded the disastrous impact of coronavirus on Brazil’s most vulnerable. A study published by the Lancet showed that inequality was a larger factor in Covid deaths in Brazil than age, health status and other risk factors, where more than 355,000 have died from the disease.

Favela-based groups delivering food and cleaning products kits during the outbreak say they have often been forced to suspend operations because of police raids.

A 36-year-old female schoolteacher, who asked not to be named for security reasons, distributed kits and listened to daily struggles at her Parque Esperança (or Hope Park) community, in the municipality of Belford Roxo, in Greater Rio.

“I visited households and I saw several people living below the poverty line,” she said. “And amid this crisis, we have been living in a war state since January.”

The current wave of violence began when police launched an incursion to set up an outpost in a community in Belford Roxo, sparking retaliation from gangs.

Since then, the sound of police helicopters is constant, and shootings break out day and night.

Fransérgio Goulart, the head of a local activist group, said that while official figures said nine people had been killed in the community, local residents say that more than 30 have been shot since January.

“One case that shocked me was that of a young man who was shot dead going home from work. His mother spent hours with her son on her lap waiting for the body to be taken away. The whole family left the community afterwards,” she said.",686,4111,16,96
0,US and China commit to cooperating on climate crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/18/us-and-china-commit-to-cooperating-on-climate-crisis,"The US and China have “committed to cooperating” on the pressing issue of climate change, the two sides said in a joint statement on Saturday, following a visit to Shanghai by US climate envoy John Kerry.

“The United States and China are committed to cooperating with each other and with other countries to tackle the climate crisis, which must be addressed with the seriousness and urgency that it demands,” said the statement from Kerry and China’s special envoy for climate change, Xie Zhenhua.

Kerry, the former US secretary of state, was the first official from president Joe Biden’s administration to visit China, signalling hopes the two sides could work together on the global challenge despite sky-high tensions on multiple other fronts.

It comes as world leaders prepare for a virtual summit on climate change this week as Joe Biden leads a new push to cut emissions. The US president has invited 40 leaders, including Chinese president Xi Jinping, to take part in the two-day summit starting on Friday 22 April, Earth Day, to galvanise efforts by major economies to combat climate change ahead of key UN talks hosted by the UK this year.

The statement said both countries “look forward” to the summit, but did not specify if Xi would attend.

“We very much hope he will take part,” Kerry, who is now in South Korea, told reporters on Sunday.

“Of course, every country will make its own decisions,” he said, adding: “We’re not seeking to force anybody. We’re seeking cooperation.”

China currently has about half of the world’s coal power, Kerry said, adding that he “talked a lot” about it with officials in Shanghai.

“I am not pointing fingers,” said Kerry. “We’ve had too much coal, other countries have too much coal, but China is the biggest, biggest coal user in the world. And because it’s such a big and powerful economy and country, it needs to move.”

The joint statement listed multiple avenues of cooperation between the US and China, the world’s top two economies that together account for nearly half of the greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change.

It stressed “enhancing their respective actions and cooperating in multilateral processes, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement”.

The nations also agreed to discuss specific “concrete” emission reduction actions including energy storage, carbon capture and hydrogen, and agreed to take action to maximise financing for developing countries to switch to low-carbon energy sources.

While Biden hoped countries would make climate commitments ahead of the Earth Day summit, Chinese vice foreign minister Le Yucheng signalled last week that China was unlikely to make any new pledges.

“For a big country with 1.4 billion people, these goals are not easily delivered,” Le said during an interview with the Associated Press in Beijing, conducted while Kerry was still in Shanghai for talks.

“Some countries are asking China to achieve the goals earlier. I am afraid this is not very realistic.”

On whether Xi would join the summit, Le said “the Chinese side is actively studying the matter”.

During a video meeting with German and French leaders on Friday, Xi also said that climate change “should not become a geopolitical chip, a target for attacking other countries or an excuse for trade barriers,” though he called for closer cooperation on the issue, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.

Li Shuo, senior climate adviser for the environmental group Greenpeace, welcomed the joint statement, saying China could soon respond to a new US pledge with one of its own, building on the “momentum” of the Shanghai talks.

“The statement in my view is as positive as the politics would allow: it sends a very unequivocal message that on this particular issue (China and the United States) will cooperate. Before the meetings in Shanghai this was not a message that we could assume,” Li said.

Biden has made climate a top priority, turning the page from his predecessor Donald Trump, who was closely aligned with the fossil fuel industry.

The US president has rejoined the 2015 Paris accord, which Kerry negotiated when he was secretary of state, and committed nations to taking action to keep temperature rises at no more than two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

Biden has pledged the US will switch to an emissions-free power sector within 14 years, and have an entirely emissions-free economy by 2050. Kerry is also pushing other nations to commit to carbon neutrality by then.

Xi announced last year that China would be carbon-neutral by 2060 and aims to reach a peak in its emissions by 2030. In March, China’s Communist party pledged to reduce carbon emissions per unit of economic output by 18% over the next five years, in line with its goal for the previous five-year period. But environmentalists say China needs to do more.",807,4906,9,52

Eleven people were killed and 98 injured in a train accident in Egypt’s Qalyubia province north of Cairo, the health ministry said in a statement.

The train was heading from Cairo to the Nile Delta city of Mansoura when four carriages derailed at 1:54pm (11:54 GMT), about 40km (25 miles) north of Cairo, Egyptian National Railways said in a short statement.

The cause of the accident is being investigated, it added.

More than 50 ambulances rushed to the site and moved the injured to three hospitals in the province, the health ministry said.

Videos on social media purportedly showed carriages overturned and passengers escaping to safety along the railway.

Egypt has seen several railway tragedies in recent years.

At least 20 people were killed and nearly 200 were injured in March when two trains collided near Tahta, about 440km (275 miles) south of Cairo.

Earlier this week, 15 people were injured after another train derailed in the northern province of Minya al-Qamh.

Egypt’s transportation minister Kamel al-Wazir, a former army general, has faced calls to resign from some Egyptians on social media. He has rejected these and said he would keep working on developing the ageing rail network.

In February 2019 an unmanned locomotive slammed into a barrier inside Cairo’s main Ramses railway station, causing a huge explosion and a fire that killed at least 25 people. That crash prompted the then-transportation minister to resign.

Egypt’s deadliest train crash was in 2002, when more than 370 people were killed after a fire broke out in an overnight train travelling from Cairo to southern Egypt.",292,1794,21,114

The Pentagon also confirmed that further stills, showing objects of various shapes, are real.

The Department of Defense's Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force is studying them.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

The Department of Defense has confirmed that images and video of triangle-shaped unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) are real and were taken by Navy personnel.

UAP is the official term for what is more commonly known as an unidentified flying object, or UFO.

The Pentagon confirmation was first reported by CNN.

The leaked images and video were published on ExtraordinaryBeliefs.com — a website run by the artist and filmmaker Jeremy Corbell — and MysteryWire.com, but they have been shared online over the last year, CNN reported.

Corbell also tweeted the footage, which can be seen here:

The video shows a glinting triangular object moving about the sky, viewed through what appears to be a circular green lens.

The Pentagon spokesperson Sue Gough said in a statement shared with Insider that three other still images that have been circulating are also genuine.

""The photographs and videos – what the Mystery Wire article refers to as 'Sphere,' 'Acorn,' and 'Metallic Blimp,' and the videos in the Extraordinary Beliefs article — were taken by Navy personnel,"" Gough said.

She declined to provide further details, citing national security. The video and images have not been officially released.

""To maintain operations security and to avoid disclosing information that may be useful to potential adversaries, DOD does not discuss publicly the details of either the observations or the examinations of reported incursions into our training ranges or designated airspace, including those incursions initially designated as UAP,"" Gough added.

The images and video are being examined by the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force, she said. The task force was set up in August last year to ""detect, analyze and catalog UAPs that could potentially pose a threat to US national security.""

UFOs returned to considerable national attention in April last year, when the Pentagon released three videos and confirmed that they had been taken by Navy personnel.

The footage, titled FLIR, GOFAST and GIMBAL, date from between 2004 and 2015. They show black shapes moving about the sky, against the wind currents, and their audio records the astonished reaction of the pilots who took the footage.",395,2503,18,93

0,Head of Tokyo Olympics again says games will not be cancelled,https://winnipeg.citynews.ca/2021/04/16/head-of-tokyo-olympics-again-says-games-will-not-be-cancelled/,"TOKYO — The head of the Tokyo Olympics on Friday was again forced to assure the world that the postponed games will open in just over three months and not be cancelled despite surging COVID-19 cases in Japan.

Organizing committee President Seiko Hashimoto was asked at a news conference if there were any conditions under which the Olympics would be cancelled.

The questions come as the general secretary of ruling LDP political party and the No. 2 in charge, Toshihiro Nikai, raised the possibility the day before.

“There are a variety of concerns but as the Tokyo 2020 organizing committee we are not thinking about cancelling the games,” Hashimoto said.

Nikai was asked on Thursday in an interview if cancellation was still an option.

“Of course,” he replied, adding that if the Olympics caused a surge in infections “there would be no meaning to having the Olympics.”

Nikai tried to backtrack later, and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga issued a statement Thursday saying there is “no change to the government position to do everything to achieve safe and secure Olympics.”

Hashimoto acknowledged Nikai’s concern and suggested it was probably shared by the Japanese public. Polls show as many as 80% in Japan oppose holding the Olympics during the pandemic.

“The fact that he (Nikai) is concerned is a point that we need to take seriously as Tokyo 2020,” she said. “His comment has reminded us of how tedious it was for us to feel confident or be fully prepared for delivering the games.”

COVID-19 cases have been rising across Japan. Despite this, the International Olympic Committee and Tokyo organizers are pressing on. The IOC has seen its income stalled by the postponement, and Japan has already invested about least $15 billion to organize these Olympics.

On Thursday, Japan’s second-largest metropolitan area of Osaka recorded 1,208 new cases. It was the third straight day that new cases surpassed 1,000. Tokyo hit 729, its highest total in more than two months.

Japan has attributed 9,500 death to COVID-19, good by world standards but poor by results in Asia. Vaccine rollout in Japan has also been very slow with fewer than 1% having received the vaccine.

The national government on Friday was set to add four more prefectures to those already under a “quasi-state of emergency.” This bring the total to 10 and now includes Tokyo neighbours Kanagawa, Chiba, and Saitama.

A majority of Brazil's Supreme Court confirmed on Thursday a decision to annul criminal convictions against former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, teeing up a presidential run against current President Jair Bolsonaro in 2022.

The decision, which was widely expected, came after Supreme Court Justice Edson Fachin determined in early March that the lower federal court where Lula was tried lacked jurisdiction, a ruling that was quickly appealed by Brazil's top prosecutor. read more

Lula, 75, governed Latin America's biggest country and largest economy between 2003 and 2011, overseeing a commodities boom that turbocharged economic growth.

In 2018, he was convicted of taking bribes from engineering firms in return for public contracts and spent a year and a half behind bars, until the Supreme Court ruled he and others could appeal their cases without serving time.

Lula and his supporters blasted the anti-corruption task force that brought him down, called Operation Car Wash, as a politically driven effort. Leaked conversations in 2019 raised questions about whether investigators had cut corners to secure prosecutions. The task force was disbanded in February.

With the convictions tossed, Lula is eligible to run once again and is the odds-on favorite among Bolsonaro opponents to take on the right-wing leader in 2022. Early polls show a tight race.

0,U.S. Intel Walks Back Claim Russians Put Bounties on American Troops,https://www.thedailybeast.com/us-intel-walks-back-claim-russians-put-bounties-on-american-troops?fbclid=IwAR3PYJKlKTqp0usjoGb2aYsZkdupf8RbGqbhIC3mpvcSor8njBAEEnTfoN4,"It was a blockbuster story about Russia’s return to the imperial “Great Game” in Afghanistan. The Kremlin had spread money around the longtime central Asian battlefield for militants to kill remaining U.S. forces. It sparked a massive outcry from Democrats and their #resistance amplifiers about the treasonous Russian puppet in the White House whose admiration for Vladimir Putin had endangered American troops.

But on Thursday, the Biden administration announced that U.S. intelligence only had “low to moderate” confidence in the story after all. Translated from the jargon of spyworld, that means the intelligence agencies have found the story is, at best, unproven—and possibly untrue.

“The United States intelligence community assesses with low to moderate confidence that Russian intelligence officers sought to encourage Taliban attacks on U.S. and coalition personnel in Afghanistan in 2019 and perhaps earlier,” a senior administration official said.

“ U.S. intelligence only had ‘low to moderate’ confidence in the story. Translated from the jargon of spyworld, that means the intelligence agencies have found the story is, at best, unproven—and possibly untrue. ”

“This information puts a burden on the Russian government to explain its actions and take steps to address this disturbing pattern of behavior,” the official said, indicating that Biden is unprepared to walk the story back fully.

Significantly, the Biden team announced a raft of sanctions on Thursday. But those sanctions, targeting Russia’s sovereign debt market, are prompted only by Russia’s interference in the 2020 election and its alleged role in the SolarWinds cyber espionage. (In contrast, Biden administration officials said that their assessment attributing the breach of technology company SolarWinds to hackers from Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service was “high confidence.”)

“We have noted our conclusion of the review that we conducted on the bounties issue and we have conveyed through diplomatic, intelligence, and military channels strong, direct messages on this issue, but we are not specifically tying the actions we are taking today to that matter,” a senior administration official told reporters in reference to the bounty claims.

According to the officials on Thursday’s call, the reporting about the alleged “bounties” came from “detainee reporting”–raising the specter that someone told their U.S.-aligned Afghan jailers what they thought was necessary to get out of a cage. Specifically, the official cited “information and evidence of connections to criminal agents in Afghanistan and elements of the Russian government” as sources for the intelligence community’s assessment.

Without additional corroboration, such reporting is notoriously unreliable. Detainee reporting from a man known as Ibn Shaikh al-Libi, extracted from torture, infamously and bogusly fueled a Bush administration claim, used to invade Iraq, about Saddam Hussein training al Qaeda to make poison gas.

The senior Biden official added on Thursday that the “difficult operating environment in Afghanistan” complicated U.S. efforts to confirm what amounts to a rumor.

When asked whether Moscow put bounties on American forces in Afghanistan, press secretary Jen Psaki said at a press briefing on Thursday that the Biden administration “felt the reports were enough of a cause for concern that we wanted our intelligence community to look into this report as a part of this overall assessment.”

Psaki reiterated the intelligence community’s low-to-moderate confidence in its assessment about possible Russian bounties but said that U.S. intelligence had “high confidence” in a separate assessment that Russian military intelligence officers “manage interaction with individuals in Afghan criminal networks” and that the “involvement of this... unit is consistent with Russia’s encouraging attacks against U.S. and coalition personnel in Afghanistan.”

“I am unsurprised that the review led to a murky determination of low to moderate confidence. While it is clear that Russia and other adversaries have been providing assistance to their proxies in Afghanistan, identifying type and amount of such assistance with great specificity has been the persistent challenge,” Jason Campbell, an Afghanistan policy official in the Obama Pentagon, told The Daily Beast.

There were reasons to doubt the story from the start. Not only did the initial stories emphasize its basis on detainee reporting, but the bounties represented a qualitative shift in recent Russian engagements with Afghan insurgents. Russian operatives have long been suspected of moving money to various Afghan militants: an out-of-favor former Taliban official told The Daily Beast on the record that Russia gave them cash for years. But the Russians had not been suspected of sponsoring attacks on U.S. forces outright–an escalation that risked confrontation with the U.S., and occurring long after it could have made a difference in the war.

As well, there seemed to be no “causative link” to any actual U.S. deaths, in the judgment of Gen. Frank McKenzie, the senior U.S. general for the Middle East and South Asia. Former U.S. diplomats and intelligence officers told The Daily Beast last summer that they viewed the bounties account skeptically. One retired diplomat suspected “someone leaked this to slow down the troop withdrawal.”

“ Former U.S. diplomats and intelligence officers told The Daily Beast last summer that they viewed the bounties account skeptically. One suspected, ‘someone leaked this to slow down the troop withdrawal.’ ”

Rarely discussed was the main reason to believe the story: the CIA actually did fund Afghan guerillas to kill Russian forces during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan of the 1980s.

The Pentagon said at the time that its massive intelligence apparatus, which includes both battlefield intelligence and the world’s most sophisticated surveillance network, did not generate the bounties story. In September, McKenzie said that the intelligence remained uncorroborated. “It just has not been proved to a level of certainty that satisfies me,” he told NBC News.

In the weeks following the existence of the uncorroborated Russian-bounty intel first breaking in The New York Times last summer, then-President Trump would repeatedly demand in closed-door meetings that whoever leaked the information be found, punished, or even “locked up,” according to sources and former administration officials with knowledge of what transpired at the time.

The initial set of Times bounty articles caught a number of senior White House staffers off-guard at first, who scrambled to figure out what was going on. One of the then-president's initial instincts was, naturally, that this was relayed to the press to make him look bad, and he would tell five individuals close to him that it further convinced him that the United States should pull its forces out of Afghanistan.

But in various meetings at the White House and in private conversations that followed that summer, Trump would continue to speculate on how or why this could have ended up in the media, three people familiar with the matter said. At times, he said he believed it was done by officials who wanted Joe Biden to win the 2020 election, or who wanted to stay and fight in Afghanistan “forever.” He demanded to know who in the CIA or intelligence community could have possibly done this to him.

“ Trump mentioned that he’d heard that the intel could have been ‘totally phony’ because it could have been drawn from intel sources who were saying anything after someone had ‘kicked the crap out of them.’ ”

At at least one point that summer, Trump mentioned that he'd heard that the intel could have been “totally phony” or manufactured because it could have been drawn from intel sources who didn't know what they were talking about, making up wild tales, or saying anything after someone had “kicked the crap out of them.”

That last speculation surprised, or somewhat confused, two of the sources who were familiar with the comment at the time, if only because Trump had repeatedly said for years that torture “absolutely works” and that the United States should revive waterboarding and other brutal measures against terror suspects. “It really sounded like the [then-]president was just grabbing for anything he could say,” one of these people recalled. “He was told by administration officials that the reporting was based on unverified claims, and he spun from that, I think.”

Regardless of whether the intelligence was fully corroborated or not, this didn't stop top officials in the Trump administration from sending notice to Russian counterparts. As The Daily Beast first reported in July, the U.S. State Department issued warnings to the Russian government that there would be a response if Moscow were then indeed caught paying bounties to Taliban fighters for the slayings of American troops in Afghanistan. Then-President Trump, for his part, publicly claimed that month that he did not raise the topic Russian leader Vladimir Putin. “That was a phone call to discuss other things, and frankly that’s an issue that many people said was fake news,” Trump said in an interview with Axios.

Meanwhile, Democrats ran with the election-time story. Then-candidate Biden called it a “horrifying revelation” if true. The senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, Robert Menendez (D-NJ), introduced a measure to sanction Russia for the alleged bounties. Congressional Democrats claimed to have been insufficiently briefed on the account, which the Trump White House called a “hoax,” and suggested there was a cover-up underway. When Trump himself denied being briefed on the story, House intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) remarked, “Is this an issue where they cannot tell the president things he doesn't want to hear when it comes to Vladimir Putin and Russia?”

0,"8 killed, multiple injured in shooting at FedEx facility in Indianapolis",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/shooting-fedex-indianapolis-1.5990075,"The former employee who shot and killed eight people at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis was interviewed by FBI agents last year, after his mother called police to say that her son might commit ""suicide by cop,"" the bureau said Friday, as investigators searched for a motive in the latest mass shooting to rock the U.S.

Coroners released the names of the victims late Friday. Four of them were members of Indianapolis' Sikh community — another blow to the Asian American community that comes a month after six people of Asian descent were killed in a mass shooting in the Atlanta area and amid ongoing attacks against Asian Americans amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Marion County Coroner's office identified the dead as:

Matthew R Alexander, 32.

Samaria Blackwell, 19.

Amarjeet Johal, 66.

Jasvinder Kaur, 64.

Jaswinder Singh, 68.

Amarjit Skhon, 48.

Karlie Smith, 19.

John Weisert, 74.

The shooter was identified as Brandon Scott Hole of Indianapolis, Deputy Police Chief Craig McCartt told a news conference. Investigators searched a home in Indianapolis associated with Hole and seized evidence, including desktop computers and other electronic media, McCartt said. The home is located in a neighbourhood of midcentury houses near Interstate 465.

Hole began firing randomly at people in the parking lot of the FedEx facility late Thursday, killing four, before entering the building, fatally shooting four more people and then turning the gun on himself, McCartt said. He said the shooter apparently killed himself shortly before police entered the building. He said he did not know if Hole owned the gun legally.

""There was no confrontation with anyone that was there,"" he said. ""There was no disturbance, there was no argument. He just appeared to randomly start shooting.""

McCartt said the slayings took place in a matter of minutes, and that there were at least 100 people in the facility at the time. Many were changing shifts or were on their dinner break, he said. Several people were wounded, including five who were taken to the hospital.

Paul Keenan, special agent in charge of the FBI's Indianapolis field office, said Friday that agents questioned Hole last year after his mother called police to say that her son might commit ""suicide by cop."" He said the FBI was called after items were found in Hole's bedroom but he did not elaborate on what they were.

He said agents found no evidence of a crime and that they did not identify Hole as espousing a racially motivated ideology. A police report obtained by The Associated Press shows that officers seized a pump-action shotgun from Hole's home after responding to the mother's call. Keenan said the gun was never returned.

McCartt said Hole was a former employee of FedEx and last worked for the company in 2020. The deputy police chief said he did not know why Hole left the job or if he had ties to the workers in the facility. He said police have not yet uncovered a motive for the shooting.

Police Chief Randal Taylor noted that a ""significant"" number of employees at the FedEx facility are members of the Sikh community, and the Sikh Coalition later issued a statement saying it was ""sad to confirm"" that at least four of those killed were community members.

The coalition, which identifies itself as the largest Sikh civil rights organization in the U.S., said in the statement that it expected authorities to ""conduct a full investigation — including the possibility of bias as a factor.""

Varun Nikore, executive director of the AAPI Victory Alliance, a national advocacy group for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, said in a statement that the shootings marked ""yet another senseless massacre that has become a daily occurrence in this country.""

Nikore added, ""The senseless gun violence that we're seeing in this country is reflective of all of the spineless politicians who are beholden to the gun lobby. Period. End of story. They will be hearing from us — instead of offering thoughts and prayers, it's time to mobilize for direct action and vote them out. That is what we're doing today. We will end the violence, only when we have leaders who have the guts to do so.""

Calls for gun control

The killings marked the latest in a string of recent mass shootings across the country and the third mass shooting this year in Indianapolis. Five people, including a pregnant woman, were shot and killed in the city in January, and a man was accused of killing three adults and a child before abducting his daughter during at argument at a home in March. In other states last month, eight people were fatally shot at massage businesses in the Atlanta area, and 10 died in gunfire at a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado.

Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett said the community must guard against resignation and ""the assumption that this is simply how it must be and we might as well get used to it.""

President Joe Biden said he had been briefed on the shooting and called gun violence ""an epidemic"" in the U.S.

Among those sentenced was Jimmy Lai, 72, who founded the pro-democracy Apple Daily newspaper. Lai received 14 months in prison for his involvement in two protests on August 18 and 31, 2019.

Also jailed for taking part in both events was Lee Cheuk-yan, a 64-year-old former lawmaker and veteran pro-democracy activist, who received a total of 14 months in prison. Three former lawmakers were jailed over the August 18 march, including ""Longhair"" Leung Kwok-hung, who received an 18 month sentence, Au Nok-hin, 10 months, and Cyd Ho, 8 months.

During Friday's sentencing hearing, judge Amanda Woodcock said the defendants ""deliberately defied the law"" and the unauthorized protests posed ""a direct challenge to the authority of the police, and therefore law and order.""

She said sentence imposed should ""reflect the seriousness of the offense and culpability,"" as well as the ""conscious decision"" by the defendants to break the law.

President Joe Biden met with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga at the White House on Friday, with Suga the first foreign leader to be hosted by the new United States administration.

The coronavirus pandemic, climate change, trade, the Tokyo Olympics, North Korea, Xinjiang and Taiwan were discussed in the talks as the Biden administration continues to pivot its foreign policy priorities towards the Indo-Pacific and US allies there.

“We committed to defending, advancing our shared values, including human rights and the rule of law,” President Biden said at a joint press conference with Suga after their meeting.

“We’re going to work together to prove that democracies can still compete and win in the 21st century,” Biden said.

Japan and the US “discussed the free and open Indo-Pacific” and agreed “to promote the vision through concrete efforts” in cooperation with Australia, India and the 10-member ASEAN nations, Suga said at the news conference.

“We also had serious talks on China’s influence over the peace and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific and the world at large,” Suga said.

“We agreed to oppose any attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion in the East and South China Seas,” he said.

“At the same time, we agreed on the necessity for each of us to engage in frank dialogue with China and in so doing, to pursue stability of international relations while upholding universal values.”

Later, at an event hosted by Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, Suga said that Japan will say what is needed to be said to China and speak up on human rights, but also stressed the need to establish a stable, constructive relationship with Beijing.

“Japan’s basic policy on pending issues caused by China is to firmly assert what should be asserted and strongly request China to take specific action,” he said. “At the same time we must work to establish a stable and constructive relationship with China.”

Prior to the meeting White House officials had hoped to win a shift in rhetoric on China and Taiwan from Suga. US and Japanese leaders last referred to Taiwan in a joint statement in 1969, when Japan’s prime minister said maintenance of peace and security in the “Taiwan area” was important for its own security. That was before Tokyo normalised ties with Beijing.

The two sides “discussed the circumstances in Taiwan and Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region as well,” said Suga who refrained from detailing the talks but added that “there is already an agreed recognition over the importance of peace and stability of the Taiwan Straits between Japan and the United States, which was reaffirmed on this occasion”.

The US is seeking to send a “clear signal” that Beijing’s recent actions surrounding Taiwan are “antithetical to the mission of maintaining peace and stability”, a senior Biden administration official said Thursday. China has sent warplanes into Taiwan’s airspace in recent days.

Biden and Suga were set to announce a $2bn Japanese investment in 5G telecommunications to counter the growing technological might of China’s Huawei Technologies, and discuss Beijing’s treatment of Muslims in the Xinjiang region and its influence over Hong Kong, a Biden administration official said prior to the meeting.

‘A lot of these lines to carefully manage’

The visit is Suga’s first trip to the US as prime minister since taking office in September. Suga inherited a China policy that has sought to balance security concerns, particularly related to disputed islands in the East China Sea, with its deep economic ties to China and its close relationship with Washington.

There had been signs of a tentative shift in Japanese rhetoric in recent months, and more political leeway from Japan’s influential business class, Jonathan Berkshire Miller, a senior fellow at the Japan Institute of International Affairs, told Al Jazeera.

That included a statement following a March meeting of US-Japan defence and foreign ministers that named China directly – something Japan has not historically wanted to do – and decried Beijing’s “coercion and destabilising behaviour”.

In the March statement, the two sides had “underscored the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait” and shared “serious concerns” about human rights in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.

Still, “Japan has a lot of lines to carefully manage” during Friday’s meeting, Miller said, and Beijing will be watching.

China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian warned Washington and Tokyo to “avoid words and actions that interfere China’s internal affairs and harm China’s interests, and refrain from engaging in forming cliques against China”.

“China will make necessary responses as appropriate,” Zhao said, speaking to reporters on Friday.

‘Make sure they’re on the same page’

Miller said a main challenge for both Suga and Biden will be navigating a view of strategic competition with China that is “not completely congruent”.

“I think they need to kind of make sure they’re on the same page on these issues,” he said.

A US official who previewed the meeting on Thursday acknowledged that Washington and Tokyo have “slightly different perspectives” on China, saying the Biden administration would not “insist on Japan somehow signing on to every dimension of our approach”.

“We also recognise the deep economic and commercial ties between Japan and China and Prime Minister Suga wants to walk a careful course, and we respect that,” he added.

A Japanese foreign ministry official said last week it had not been decided whether there would be a joint statement on Taiwan sought by the White House.

Two Japanese governing party lawmakers familiar with the discussions told the Reuters news agency that officials had been divided about whether Suga should endorse a strong statement on Taiwan.

Quad

Friday’s White House meeting was intended to invigorate joint efforts between the US, Australia, India and Japan, an informal alliance known as the Quad, that the Biden administration views as a bulwark against China in the Indo-Pacific.

Other expected “deliverables” included a “broader, deeper set of engagements across technology, policy, health-related matters, climate, and also regional security,” the Biden administration official had said in advance of the meeting.",1029,6472,13,75

0,"Greek, Turkish foreign ministers clash at press conference",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/15/greek-turkish-ministers-clash-at-press-conference,"The Greek foreign minister used his opening remarks to rattle off a series of longstanding complaints about Turkey.

The foreign ministers of Greece and Turkey have exchanged accusations on a wide range of issues during a volatile press conference at the end of their first meeting in over a year.

The meeting between Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and his Greek counterpart Nikos Dendias was ostensibly designed to show the two uneasy NATO neighbours trying to put aside their differences after a year of complex disputes.

The two countries teetered on the edge of all-out war when their gunboats collided while shadowing each other during a Turkish push into disputed eastern Mediterranean waters last August.

The press conference opened with conciliatory remarks from Cavusoglu in which he praised “the very positive dialogue” they just held in the Turkish capital.

Cavusoglu said he believes the disputes with Greece can be resolved through constructive dialogue, and that faits accomplis and provocative rhetoric should be avoided in relations between the two countries.

“It is in our interests that minorities in both countries live in peace, it will have a positive impact on our relations,” he said.

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, right, walks with Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias, left, following their joint media statement after their meeting in Ankara, Turkey on April 15, 2021 [Burhan Ozbilici/AP Photo] But Dendias used his opening remarks to rattle off a series of longstanding complaints about Turkey – from its search for natural gas in contested waters to its treatment of the Greek Orthodox minority and the sides’ ongoing dispute about migrants.

“Greece’s position is clear and this is not the first time you have heard it,” Dendias told Cavusoglu during a particularly heated moment in the 35-minute press conference.

“If you heavily accuse my country and people before the press, I have to be in a position to respond to that,” Cavusoglu replied.

“If you want to continue our tensions, we can,” he added.

Dendias also expressed support for Turkey’s bid to join the European Union but said any violations of Greece’s sovereignty would be sanctioned.

His comments prompted an angry response from Cavusoglu who described them as “unacceptable”, prompting Dendias to say he was surprised Cavusoglu had expected him to act as if nothing had happened in the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean.

Tensions between neighbours

Dendias’s visit to Ankara is the first from a high-profile Greek minister in more than two years.

The continued threat of armed conflict between the two NATO allies has alarmed the European Union.

Tensions had flared last year as Turkish research ships explored for oil and gas reserves in waters claimed by Greece and its close ally Cyprus.

Other issues include competing claims over their respective continental shelves, maritime rights, air space in the Mediterranean, energy, the Cyprus issue and the status of some islands in the Aegean Sea.

Turkey has also accused the Greek coastguard of putting lives at risk by forcing migrants trying to reach the Greek islands back into Turkish waters. Meanwhile, Greece has claimed Turkey is facilitating such crossings in breach of a 2016 refugee deal between Ankara and the EU.",526,3305,8,58
0,Covid-19: India sees new spike in cases despite vaccine rollout,https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n854,"Anoo Bhuyan New Delhi

India is experiencing a sharp spike in covid-19 cases after months of numbers dropping. The rise comes as India celebrates festivals like Holi, religious functions like the Kumbh Mela, and with five states currently involved in elections.

The country’s pandemic curve had been flattening by January and February this year but has taken a sharp upward turn since March. On 27 March, India’s confirmed active cases on the day were 62 632, the highest seen since October 2020.

Globally, India has had the third highest number of confirmed cases and deaths from covid-19 after Brazil and the US. As of 29 March, India had 12 million cases and 162 000 deaths from the disease.1

Last week, the Indian government acknowledged a “surge in covid-19 cases” and asked states to focus on “stringent containment and public health measures” including increasing testing, tracing, and vaccination. A press release from the government2 put the onus for the second wave of infections on “the laxity among everyone.” The central government has asked state governments to take this surge in infections seriously, so as to not be “frittering away” the gains of last year’s work to bring down numbers.

Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India, said there has been a “perfect storm” of reasons for the spike. “The recent rapid upswing in cases is from a confluence of careless crowd behaviours, slackening of governmental vigil, and mutations of the virus.” He said that the decline in deaths between October 2020 and January 2021, “gave rise to a popular belief that the danger has fully passed, reinforced by overly confident assertions by some experts and politicians that we have attained herd immunity.”

The western state of Maharashtra contributed the bulk of active cases in India throughout the pandemic and in this current surge. As on 28 March 2021, Maharashtra had 320 000 active cases of covid-19, far ahead of the second highest state of Kerala, which has 24 578 active cases. According to a recent government assessment,3 Maharashtra accounts for 62% of all active cases in the country.

Indian vaccines India’s ability to control the spread of covid-19 and its demand for and supply of vaccines will impact global supply. According to government data,4 74 countries are currently using vaccines made in India. In total, India has supplied 60 million doses to the world—8.1 million have been grants to counties including Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, and Nepal.4 Some 34 million have been commercial sales, and 18 million have been given to Covax. India began its covid-19 vaccination programme on 16 January. Initially, it was only for health and frontline workers. On 1 March, this was expanded to everyone older than 60, and those older than 45 who have specific comorbidities. So far, it has administered over 60 million vaccinations, placing it third globally after China and the US.5

New variants India began its genomic sequencing project for covid-19 last year but, according to a paper6 published by Indian government scientists involved in the sequencing, its pace and volume has been insufficient when compared with India’s high number of cases. A recent press statement7 from the government said that even though variants of concern have been found in India, they have not been detected in high enough numbers to either establish a direct relationship or explain the rapid surge in cases. In total, Indian government laboratories have done the genome sequencing of 10 787 samples of SARS-CoV2 to look for variants, and found 771.

Another lockdown? The Indian government has not enforced another national lockdown as it did in the early months of the pandemic, but the chief ministers of different states have not ruled it out. In Maharashtra, the chief minister Udhav Thackeray has said repeatedly that another lockdown could be imposed if case numbers continue rising. The government has instead imposed a night curfew, restricting movement after dark. Earlier this month, the state published guidelines8 insisting that private offices continue to work from home and allowing 50% of their staff to work from office. Theatres and auditoriums have also been told to function at 50% capacity. In Delhi, the national capital, the chief minister has said that a lockdown would not be a solution, and that people should “learn to live” with the disease instead.9 The Delhi government has announced that there will be random testing for SARS-CoV2 at public places. The civic corporation in Mumbai, the capital city of Maharashtra, has said the same. Fines10 for not wearing a mask have increased in some states. Many states insist on a negative RT-PCR test result for covid-19 in order to be allowed entry into the state via flight or road. Public gatherings like weddings have been given caps on how many guests can be allowed. Festival celebrations have been barred11 in public, although the restriction has not so far been strictly enforced.12

For now, the blaze is thought to be a wildfire. No foul play is suspected, but a windchange earlier on Sunday scuppered efforts to contain the flames. At that point, UCT found itself in deep trouble.

Precious archives, historic texts, and collections of African Studies are all in jeopardy this afternoon. The UCT Library is home to some classic publications, and has a long-standing history as an extraordinary hub for higher education.

After a year of off-campus learning, online classes, and various lockdown restrictions, the last thing this struggling group of students needs is a natural disaster at the heart of their university. This event is weighing heavy on both learners and Capetonians alike, who are powerless to intervene as a site of remarkable cultural significance gets gutted by fire.

At least five rockets hit the Iraqi military airbase at Balad north of Baghdad, wounding two Iraqi soldiers, the Iraqi military said in a statement.

Security officials had said earlier that the Katyusha rockets had fallen on the area of the base that houses US contractors, and that no casualties had been reported.

No group immediately claimed the attack on Sunday, but armed groups that some Iraqi officials say are backed by Iran have claimed similar incidents in the past.

US officials have blamed Iranian-backed militias for regular rocket attacks aimed at US facilities in Iraq, including the US Embassy in Baghdad.

The last attack on the Balad airbase was on April 4, when at least two rockets fell in the sparsely populated surrounding area.

F-16 aircraft are stationed at the airbase and several maintenance companies are present there, employing Iraqi and foreign staff.

The attack comes few days after an explosives-laden drone targeted US-led coalition forces near a northern Iraq airport, causing a large fire and damage to a building.

The incident was the latest in a string of attacks targeting mostly US installations in Iraq in recent weeks.

There have been about 20 bomb or rocket attacks against American interests, including bases hosting US soldiers, since US President Joe Biden took office in January.

Dozens of others took place from the autumn of 2019 under the administration of Donald Trump.

American forces withdrew from Iraq in 2011 but returned in 2014 at the invitation of Iraq to help battle ISIL (ISIS) after the group seized vast areas in the north and west of the country.

In late 2020, US troop levels in Iraq were reduced to 2,500 after withdrawals based on orders from the Trump administration.

Calls grew for further American troop withdrawals after a US-directed drone strike killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and an Iraqi militia leader in Baghdad in January 2020.

Last month, a base in western Iraq housing US-led coalition troops and contractors was hit by 10 rockets. One contractor was killed.

The US last week committed to withdrawing all remaining combat forces from Iraq, although the two countries did not set a timeline for what would be a second US withdrawal since the 2003 invasion which toppled Saddam Hussein.

The announcement came as the Biden administration resumed a “strategic dialogue” with the government of Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, who is seen as too close to Washington by pro-Iranian groups.",423,2603,8,57

I was impressed when he first showed up and appeared to roll a pencil across my desk using only his mind, but then he insisted it was basic misdirection and called me a dumbass for believing in psychic powers.

REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui

India pledged on Friday to raise monthly production of its own COVID-19 vaccine about tenfold to nearly 100 million doses by September, as immunisations have slowed in the country despite a surge in new infections.

After donating and selling tens of millions vaccine doses abroad, India has suddenly found itself short of Covaxin, its only domestically made shot. The government is now trying to raise production at manufacturer Bharat Biotech, and fast-track imports of other vaccines. read more

The ministry of science and technology, giving the September target, pegged current capacity at 10 million doses a month.

""The current production capacity of indigenously developed Covaxin vaccine will be doubled by May-June 2021 and then increased nearly 6-7 fold by July-August,"" it said.

The ministry added that the government would provide $17 million in funding to boost Covaxin output. Apart from Bharat Biotech, two state-sector firms - Haffkine Biopharmaceutical and Indian Immunologicals Ltd - will develop a combined monthly capacity of up to 35 million doses in the coming months, under the plan.

India's daily vaccinations peaked at 4.5 million doses on April 5, as its second wave of infections picked up, but have averaged about 3 million a day since then, according to the government's Co-Win portal that coordinates immunisations.

The AstraZeneca (AZN.L) vaccine, made locally by the Serum Institute of India (SII), accounts for more than 91% of the 115.5 million doses given in the country. But a production ramp-up at SII, the world's biggest vaccine maker, has been delayed by a raw-material shortage due to U.S. supply restrictions.

ENOUGH FOR NINE DAYS

SII Chief Executive Adar Poonawalla appealed directly to U.S. President Joe Biden to end the supply curb, which is aimed at supporting American vaccine companies.

""Respected @POTUS, if we are to truly unite in beating this virus, on behalf of the vaccine industry outside the U.S., I humbly request you to lift the embargo of raw-material exports out of the U.S. so that vaccine production can ramp up,"" Poonawalla said on Twitter.

India has reported the most number of COVID-19 cases in the world this month. Its total of 14.3 million infections since the pandemic began is the most after the United States. India has also recorded 174,308 deaths. read more

Many vaccination centres in India are now rationing supplies though they are only inoculating people above 45 years, having started the campaign in mid-January with front-line workers.

India has administered the most doses in the world after the United States and China, but it ranks much lower per capita.

The government said on Friday the country had a stock of about 26.7 million doses of vaccines. Going by vaccination rates in the past week, that will last about nine days.

India this week gave emergency authorisation to Russia's Sputnik V vaccine and imports to cover as many as 125 million people will start this month. The government has also urged Pfizer, Moderna (MRNA.O) and Johnson and Johnson (JNJ.N) to sell their shots to India.

Petition to Label Criticism of Police as Hate Speech Was Authored By Liberal MP’s ‘Subject Matter Expert’

The author of a new House of Commons petition calling for criticism of police to be classified as hate speech is listed as a paid “subject matter expert” for Winnipeg MP Kevin Lamoureux.

Lamoureux controversially sponsored the petition and expressed his support for the petition’s aims.

The petition, authored by former Winnipeg Police officer Stan Tataryn, argues that police should be classified as an “identifiable group” under hate laws, something that would criminalize the use of language implying police are “despised, scorned, denied respect, and made subject to ill-treatment on the basis of group affiliation.”

Anti-hate groups say the petition perverts the purpose of hate laws, stressing that using hate speech legislation to shield police from public criticism is “extremely inappropriate.”

One thing Lamoureux did not previously disclose about the petition he sponsored is that the person who wrote it worked as his office’s in-house “expert.”

House of Commons records show that Tartaryn was paid thousands of dollars by Lamoureux’s office — expenditure reports show Tataryn received monthly payments of $510 between July and December 2020, totalling over $3,000.

The reports do not detail what kind of work Tataryn provided apart from describing him as a “subject matter expert.”

In a statement to PressProgress, Lamoureux’s office said Tataryn no longer works for their office, and characterized him not as a “subject matter expert” but as a “community outreach” worker.

“I can confirm this individual is no longer employed by our office, and that he worked in community outreach,” Lamoureux’s spokesperson told PressProgress.

Tataryn explained to PressProgress that he worked 30 hours a month doing community outreach in Lamoureux’s riding and that his “main function” was to “liaison with the non-profits in that area and keep them abreast of new government funding available to them and assist them in the application process.”

“My expertise was gained in thirty five years of Police Service,” Tataryn pointed out, noting that “twenty four of it in supervisory and administrative positions.”

“As for whether our relationship influenced MP Lamoureux to support our position, will get a question that he will have to answer,” Tataryn said.

Last week, Lamoureux told the Winnipeg Free Press he supports of the spirit of the petition, stating that he thinks there is a “great deal of merit for us to give more positive attention to law enforcement officers.”

“When it comes to law enforcement personnel, it takes just a few bad apples to portray a relatively negative image, and it’s not fair.”

Neither Lamoureux nor Tataryn, who is also the former president of the Liberal Party of Canada’s Manitoba chapter, disclosed these personal, partisan or financial connections in the newspaper’s front page story profiling Tataryn’s petition.

I was asked for a comment on this and I’m so upset with how this story turned out. For WFP to give this man such a platform – cover story! – and lend so much credence to his harmful position, is so disappointing. MSM needs to stop pandering to police in the name of ‘neutrality.’ https://t.co/PgNgcnQvAJ — Paula Ethans (@PaulaEthans) April 15, 2021

Community advocacy group Winnipeg Police Cause Harm believes this financial relationship should have been disclosed upfront.

“It’s unsettling and it just feels questionable,” Buck Doyle, a spokesperson for WPCH told PressProgress. “In this kind of realm, people should be honest and open about what is influencing them and Lamoureux did not take the moment to explain this existing relationship.”

“We know the police have a lot of power physically on the streets, but we also know they have a lot of informal power that we don’t always see in public,” Doyle said.

“I think this is an example of the ways they have an ‘in’ with politicians that other people don’t always have, and they exercise this power in different ways that we don’t always get to see. It’s just another example of the ways they wield their unchecked power.”

The petition has been criticized by local community and Indigenous groups, including most recently the Southern Chiefs Organization.

“When I heard about this petition, I had to make sure it was actually true,” said SCO Grand Chief Jerry Daniels in a press release.

“To equate the lived experience of police forces with First Nations and other racialized peoples is dumbfounding at best. It’s one thing to have a former member of the Winnipeg Police Service lead this misinformed and tone-deaf initiative, but to have a member of parliament take a lead role is extremely disheartening.”",780,4867,48,300

Effective at 12:01 a.m. on Monday, religious services, weddings and funerals will be limited to 10 people indoors.

Solicitor General Sylvia Jones told reporters checks will be put in place at the Manitoba and Quebec borders effective as of 12:01 a.m. on Monday. Visitors will be prohibited from entering and exiting Ontario with the exception of essential purposes such as work, medical care and the transportation of goods.

The Government of Quebec announced on Friday it would close its borders with Ontario in an effort to tighten movement between the provinces. The province’s public safety minister said in a statement on Twitter discussions are underway between the Quebec and Ontario governments.

To enforce the measures unveiled by the government, Jones said police and bylaw officers will now be able to stop motorists and pedestrians to ask them where they live and why they’re not at home. The new police regulations drew immediate condemnation from civil liberties activists.

The Canadian Civil Liberties Association said granting police the authority to stop and question anyone at random risks a “rash of racial profiling.”

“Random police stops during COVID are unconstitutional, presuming those outdoors or driving to be guilty,” Michael Bryant, head of the CCLA, said.

Ford also called on the federal government to “immediately tighten up international borders.”

Labour, Training and Skills Development Minister Monte McNaughton said the province will be shutting down non-essential construction on projects such as shopping malls, hotels and office towers.

“However there are still projects that are critical to our health like building our homes, hospitals, assessment centres and long-term care homes and we need to ensure those on these sites are being kept safe,” McNaughton said.

Beginning on Friday, McNaughton said 200 inspectors will be visiting more than 1,300 construction sites over the four weeks to ensure public health measures are in place.

He added law firms, accounting offices and other locations where employees could potentially work from home will also be inspected.

Meanwhile, during the news conference, Ford repeatedly blamed a lack of vaccine supply for the situation the province is in and announced officials will be boosting supply in hot spots by 25 per cent. However, Ford did not elaborate on how that plan will unfold.

“Would we be in this position if we were getting 300,000 vaccines back in February like the rest of the world? The answer is absolutely not. We wouldn’t be facing the crisis with ICUs, we wouldn’t be having shut down, we wouldn’t have the schools shut down,” he said.

“We need the vaccines … The feds need to get us the vaccines, bottom line.”

The new restrictions came as the provincial government unveiled new projection data on Friday indicating the only way to flatten the surge of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations is a six-week stay-at-home order and at least 100,000 doses of vaccine administered a day.

According to the documents, there has been a 67 per cent growth in hospitalizations related to the virus and a 51 per cent growth in ICU occupancy.

Officials also noted under every scenario, more vaccinations mean a faster resolution to the COVID-19 crisis in the long run.

This is a developing story that will be updated throughout the day.

0,Escaped girls tell of insurgents’ mass abductions in Mozambique | Mozambique,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/17/escaped-girls-tell-of-insurgents-mass-abductions-in-mozambique,"Insurgents in Mozambique have abducted hundreds of women and girls, forcing many into sexual relations with fighters and possibly trafficking others elsewhere in Africa, interviews with some who have escaped the extremists reveal.

Most of the abducted women are under 18, with the youngest about 12 years old. They are being held in a series of camps and bases across insurgent-controlled territory in north-eastern Mozambique.

Many are chosen by young fighters as “wives” and forced into sexual relations. Conditions are extremely harsh, with limited medical care, long marches under guard, unreliable food supplies and a constant risk of attacks by government forces or mercenaries.

The mass abductions recall that of more than 200 female students from a school in the town of Chibok in Nigeria in 2014 by the Boko Haram group. Media attention, a Twitter campaign and interventions by celebrities led to the US and other western powers committing soldiers, intelligence specialists and substantial funds to the effort to rescue the young women.

The insurgency in Mozambique’s far north, which started four years ago, has killed thousands and displaced almost half a million people.

The interviews, conducted with 23 women last year by researchers from the Observatório do Meio Rural (Rural Environment Observatory), a Mozambique-based thinktank, offer an unprecedented glimpse inside an opaque and little-known group.

“This is the first time we have heard from people who have been inside,” said Joe Hanlon, an expert on Mozambique at the London School of Economics. The research also casts new light on the leadership of the insurgents, and appears to undermine claims by the US government and others that they have close ties with Islamic State.

João Feijó, author of a report based on the interviews, said that he believed more than 1,000 girls and young women had been abducted.

“These kinds of numbers would be a major logistic problem for the insurgents, and I believe that some girls have been trafficked. We have reports of women being selected to study English in neighbouring Tanzania, which sounds like a euphemism for being trafficked,” Feijó said.

“This report tell the story of those who ran away but doesn’t tell the story of those who are still there or who have been trafficked. Their voices are silent.”

The interviews reveal how only “young and attractive girls” are targeted by the insurgents. Those selected are known as “noodles”, a rare food seen as desirable, in contrast to “sorghum”, a staple, the women told researchers.

“Adolescent girls are the most favourite victims; other ages are spared,” one interviewee said.

In an attack last year on Mocímboa da Praia, a small coastal town still in the hands of insurgents, more than 300 women and girls were forced into trucks at gunpoint or marched from their homes.

One interviewee said that some people lost three to four children in the attack as the insurgents went “from house to house and captured the girls and took them away”.

Captive women are forced to attend “education” sessions of Qur’anic instruction and ideological lectures, according to the interviewees.

“They are given food, clothes and efforts are made to integrate them as ‘wives’. But this is not a choice. They are in a scenario of great violence and need food and security,” Feijó said.

A small number of women appear to have actively participated in military attacks, carrying weapons and choosing those who will be abducted.

The recent successes of the insurgents in Mozambique – whose organisation is known as both al-Shabaab and Ansar al-Sunna – have prompted global fears of a new extremist Islamist enclave in southern Africa.

Factions affiliated to Isis and to al-Qaida have grown in strength across the continent in recent years, one of the few regions of the world where both have expanded.

Interviewees said that many of the leaders of the extremists in Mozambique were local men, but there were some foreigners from elsewhere on the east African coast, particularly Tanzania. There were also reports of South African nationals, Somalis and others presumed to be from Arab countries in Africa or the Middle East.

They also described the training of abducted teenage boys in the use of machetes and firearms.

One remembered seeing a 14-year-old boy going on his first mission.

“We saw him, all happy, telling the fighters how he had killed people. He had killed them with one shot and then he had beheaded them,” she said.

The question of Isis links among the insurgents in Mozambique is controversial. The militants were acknowledged as an official affiliate of Isis last year and in March the US state department designated what it called the “Islamic State of Iraq and Syria – Mozambique” as a foreign terrorist organisation.

Some analysts attribute more effective tactics of insurgents in Mozambique to outside assistance. “In 2020, there was no doubt that they had international support … and there were many videos being shared where they were showing the Isis flag,” said Feijó.

Interviewees said the Isis flag was flown at insurgent bases and Isis claimed the group’s most recent attack on the port of Palma.

But others worry that the US designation may be counterproductive.

“I think the links are very loose. The affiliation is a kind of public relations effort on both sides … If you really make [the insurgency] Isis and global you highlight it for global jihadis and for Isis,” said Hanlon.",927,5687,11,76
0,Birmingham launches taskforce as babies die at twice national rate,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/apr/18/birmingham-launches-taskforce-as-babies-die-at-twice-national-rate,"A taskforce is being set up to tackle baby deaths in Birmingham, after a report revealed infant mortality rates in the city are nearly twice the national average, with families from Pakistani backgrounds disproportionately affected.

Councillors described the situation as “distressing” and said the report made for uncomfortable reading after it highlighted deprivation, ethnicity and health inequalities as key factors in the stubbornly high numbers, which equate to more than 100 babies dying before their first birthday in the city every year.

“Something is going wrong. We need to act to put it right,” said the councillor Rob Pocock, the chair of the health and social care scrutiny committee, which produced the report. “This is a tragedy that can and must be reduced.”

The infant mortality rate in Birmingham is seven deaths per 1,000 live births, compared with 3.9 deaths in England as a whole, and numbers have not declined in recent years as they have done nationally.

Death rates are highest in the areas of the city with the worst deprivation, a key issue in Birmingham where 28.1% of children live in low-income families compared with 17% nationally.

On Tuesday, councillors voted in favour of establishing a new multi-agency taskforce with the goal of reducing infant mortality in the city by at least 50% by 2025, and working with community groups and faith leaders to help minimise risk factors.

The report said data from Birmingham’s 2011 census showed Pakistani, black African and Afro-Caribbean populations were overrepresented in child deaths, and analysis from the city’s Child Death Overview Panel highlighted Pakistani families as being particularly affected.

Nationally, stillbirth and neonatal mortality rates (death within 28 days of birth) are 60% higher for babies of Asian and Asian British ethnicity compared with babies of white ethnicity, and 45% higher for babies of black or black British ethnicity.

This equates to one in 188 Asian or Asian British babies being stillborn compared with one in every 295 babies of white ethnicity.

“Really, more work does need to be done to understand why there is such a significant and frankly unacceptable variation among different communities,” said Josie Anderson, the policy, research and campaigns manager at Bliss, the leading UK charity for babies born premature or sick.

“Research has shown women living in the most deprived areas had an 80% higher risk of stillbirth and neonatal deaths compared to women living in the least deprived areas. And of course there is quite a lot of intersection between women living in deprived areas and also ethnicity as well.” She advocated the use of continuity of care practices where women are treated by either the same midwife or a very small group of midwives throughout their pregnancy to boost trust and communication.

The report said a fifth of infant deaths in Birmingham were caused by abnormalities at birth, the risk of which is doubled by consanguineous marriage (marriage between couples related as second cousins or closer), a study has shown. Pocock said the report “sought not to exaggerate this issue but we have also not ignored it. It is part and parcel of the range of complex factors that we face in attempting to deal with the problems of infant mortality.”

The report said the challenge in tackling the potential risk of consanguinity was “complicated by cultural sensitivities and misconceptions […] as well as inadequate knowledge and skills among healthcare professionals and low levels of trust among communities that have past experience of discrimination”.

Shabana Qureshi, the wellbeing manager at Ashiana Community Project in Sparkbrook, an inner-city area with the second-highest non-white population in Birmingham, was one of the contributors to the report. “In terms of the scientific rationale as to why intermarriage is such a risk, I think there’s some awareness but it’s limited,” she said.

“There is awareness that when you marry a closer relative, there is a higher risk that your child may have some complications surrounding its birth. But I think that’s often dismissed because the communities we are working with are predominantly of Pakistani origin and in Pakistan 50% or more of the population practice consanguinity. It’s something that’s quite normalised.”

She said “consistent and culturally sensitive” messaging was crucial to improving genetic literacy in the community, but stressed that child poverty was still the main factor that needed addressing. “Across all of the ethnic groups, including Pakistani, Bangladeshi and black communities, you’re more likely to experience higher levels of perinatal death or stillbirth due to socioeconomic deprivation,” she said.

“We need to address that blatant inequality so a baby born in a particular area to a person of a particular ethnicity has just as much a chance of survival as a baby being born in an affluent area.”",788,4947,10,66
0,Pentagon confirms leaked photos and video of UFOs are legitimate,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/16/pentagon-ufos-leaked-photos-uap?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other,"Furthering the growing interest in unidentified flying objects, or what the US government refers to as unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), the Department of Defense confirmed on Thursday that recently leaked photos and videos of UFOs were legitimate and taken by navy personnel.

Sue Gough, a spokesperson for the Pentagon, confirmed to CNN that images and footage of a blinking triangular object in the sky, along with other UAPs that were categorized as a “sphere”, “acorn” and “metallic blimp”, were taken by navy personnel in 2019.

Gough told CNN that the defense department would not comment further on the nature of the footage or share any examinations into them.

“To maintain operations security and to avoid disclosing information that may be useful to potential adversaries, DoD does not discuss publicly the details of either the observations or the examinations of reported incursions into our training ranges or designated airspace, including those incursions initially designated as UAP,” Gough said in the statement.

Last April, the Pentagon released three videos of UAPs taken in 2004 and 2015 that included audio of pilots amazed at the speed of the objects they were seeing. “Look at that thing, dude!” one pilot said. “It’s rotating!”

The release of the footage kicked off federal interest in investigating UAPs. In August, the defense department created a UAP taskforce following pressure from congressional lawmakers. In December, Congress passed its government funding bill that included a directive to the national intelligence director and defense secretary to release a report on UAPs in six months’ time.

Last month, Donald Trump’s former intelligence director John Ratcliffe teased the contents of the report, telling Fox News that the document would include unknown sightings from “all over the world”.

“Frankly, there are a lot more sightings than have been made public,” Ratcliffe said.

Per Congress’s spending bill, the UAP report must be published by early June to meet its deadline.",316,2023,10,64
1,Deal Alert: The Quantity Of Raw Plastic And Silicon That Makes Up An Xbox Series X Can Be Yours For Just $8.27,https://ogn.theonion.com/deal-alert-the-quantity-of-raw-plastic-and-silicon-tha-1845728216,"Whoa-ho-ho, gamers, looks like the deal of the year has been staring us in the face all along! After getting off the phone with a representative at DuPont, it turns out that 9.8 pounds of silicon and plastic is way more affordable than we assumed, meaning you can own the quantity of materials that make up an Xbox Series X for a mere $8.27!

Looks like Christmas came early for any gamers looking to buy the constituent components making up the hottest ticket of this holiday system!



Sure, Microsoft’s latest and greatest console might be backordered at every electronics store in the country, but that’s no excuse for not owning the basic materials that form its semiconductors and casing—and at a fraction of the cost! In fact, if you buy it wholesale at scale—we’re talking 200 to 300 pounds of silicon—you can get it for even cheaper. Of course, owning five palettes of industrial-grade silicon might be a bit much for the average gamer, but for the right person, it would mean having the equivalent of 30 Xbox Series Xs. Think about that!

Just imagine the look your friends will have when you invite them over to check out your new Xbox and you point out the pallet of chemical materials sitting on your entertainment center. Heck, you could even take a welding class for only an additional $125 or so at the local adult education center, and then you’re almost all the way to owning this face-melting graphical powerhouse. Assuming you get some sort of engineering degree, you could even melt the plastic down in an industrial furnace, form it into a shape approximating the real thing, and paint it matte black. Pretty cool, huh?

It’s enough to put a smile on any Microsoft fanboy or fangirl’s face!

Plus, Halo Infinite might not even be out yet, but the polycarbonate that its 4K Blu-Ray is made out of only costs $1.90 per pound. Picture the jealousy in your best bud’s eyes when you pull out a handful of that, point to it, and say, “T his could be Master Chief’s next adventure and it’s all mine! ” Really, all you’d have to do is carve the polycarbonate into 0.6 MM layers, then use a laser to inscribe it in just the right way and you’d be well on your way to getting the first-ever playable copy of 343 Industry’s next sci-fi epic in the whole world!

But jump on this deal quick, gamers! Once people catch wind that they could be getting their hands on a real-life approximation of the Series X for pennies on the dollar, they’re going to be standing in line outside every raw material supplier’s warehouse in the country. Heck, we’ll say it. This is the most exciting time for video games since we learned back in the ’ 80s that all you have to do is rearrange a few billion cells in your body and you’d become Shigeru Miyamoto.",496,2766,22,110
0,Hong Kongers say they're being targeted by Chinese agents on Canadian soil,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/hong-kongers-say-they-re-being-targeted-by-chinese-agents-on-canadian-soil-1.5390456,"TORONTO -- “We know where you are. We’re coming to get you.”

The person on the other line of Cherie Wong’s Vancouver hotel room phone repeated that threat multiple times, until she hung up, stunned.

It was January 2020, and Wong – who’s executive director of Alliance Canada Hong Kong -- had travelled from Toronto to Vancouver to host a series of events surrounding the imminent launch of the pro-democracy group.

Out of an abundance of caution, Wong’s room was booked under another name by a member of the group – but they found her anyway.

""They"" being suspected agents of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), according to Wong and her group.

“Two days after the launch, very early in the morning, I received a phone call on my hotel landline to say ‘we know you’re there, this is your room number, we’re coming to get you,’” Wong said in an interview with CTVNews.ca. “I hung up the phone after a little bit when they kept repeating the same words, and…I shook. I shook sitting there and there were no tears, there was no screaming, it was just a calm, silent panic that went through my body.”

“I can still feel just how horrified I was. They knew where I was…it was just fear in that moment.”

Wong is one of many Hong-Kongers and other East Asian diaspora who say they have felt directly threatened and harassed by what they believe are CCP agents operating domestically in Canada.

The abuse has been ramping up since the major Hong Kong pro-democracy protests in 2019 and the subsequent implementation of the mainland’s National Security Law.

Officials have taken the rare step in recent years to directly label China as a “significant concern” for Canada – with intelligence agency reports painting a grim picture of how the CCP operates within the country.

But for Wong and other activists, their day-to-day lives are significantly affected by foreign influence, with their safety - and the safety of their family and friends overseas – directly on the line.

‘GREY ZONE’

Wong said that in the past year, Hong Kong activists have experienced “countless harassment incidents, online attacks and physical altercations” with agents and individuals that they believe are acting on behalf of the Chinese government.

“A lot of the times when we do try and seek help from law enforcement, we are getting bounced between departments,” Wong said. “We're told to call 911. We get connected to the local police who then say this is a foreign policy issue, [and] send us to RCMP, who say there's nothing we can do for you, and they send us to CSIS, and CSIS sends us [back] to the local department.”

Wong said the experience of being “bounced around” between departments and agencies feels like there is no one listening to them.

“I don’t think that any of these agencies are equipped to deal with foreign harassment operations…often these cases are not criminal offences, but they border on this grey zone where its somewhere between criminal harassment and a civil dispute,” she said. “Without that nuanced lens to understand that this harassment is actually targeting human rights activists – the activists suffer.”

CANADA’S 'FOREIGN INFLUENCE' PROBLEM

Stephanie Carvin, an ex-Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) analyst and associate professor of international relations at Carleton University, said that Canadians have long been a target of foreign interference.

“Canada has long had a foreign influence problem. It's happened for decades, it's not just China, and I think we don't really have an infrastructure for dealing with it because we've always seen it as a foreign problem,” Carvin said in a telephone interview with CTVNews.ca

“We're seeing this a lot,” Carvin continued. “We've seen this against Tibetans. We've seen it against Uyghurs in Canada, and now we're seeing it against Hong Kong activists as well.”

Mimi Lee, a member of the Toronto Hong Kongers Action Group, said she was followed after a protest in 2019 in front of City Hall.

“All the police officers had already left, I was alone because I was going back to my car,” Lee said in an interview with CTVNews.ca. “I felt that person following me…so I had to run around and try to get away from them.”

Lee said she did not file a police report for that instance, as she “had no evidence” and that it was “too scary” to turn around to take a picture.

Two members of the pro-democracy group Halifax- Hong Kong Link, who CTV News has agreed not to name due to their fear of reprisals, also spoke of the fear they live with on Canadian soil.

One member said they had tried to reach out for help to Halifax police and a local MP, but that it was “hard to describe why you're being followed and why you've been put on propaganda.”

Describing a 2019 Halifax pro-democracy rally, the member said their small group of about eight protesters were “surrounded” by “50 to 60” pro-mainland counter-protesters.

“For at least eight hours, [they were] chanting the Chinese national anthem, booing at us and taking our pictures,” the member described, adding that in messages and articles circulated online afterwards in places like WeChat, the pro-democracy group were called “separatists,” and that the mainland group had “corrected” them “on their thoughts” and showed “what loving China is.”

The member specified they did not suspect all of the pro-mainland rally goers of being CCP agents, but said there is an expectation for Chinese-Canadians to attend on behalf of the mainland’s interests.

Carvin said situations like that are hard for law enforcement to investigate as intimidation because “how do you prove that someone is motivated by clandestine foreign influence purposes?”

However, Carvin agreed that China’s “foreign interference” is often implemented in “exactly the kinds of activities [the activists] are describing.”

Another member of the Halifax-Hong Kong Link who travelled to Hong Kong to participate in the 2019 pro-democracy protests, says they’re “wary of being watched,” and never show their face in public when protesting as they’re “afraid of being found out.”

Both Wong, Lee and the other activists interviewed by CTVNews.ca mentioned “bystanders” coming to pro-democracy protests and filming or taking close-up photographs of the activists – something they say is used by the CCP to put pressure on relatives overseas.

“Since the National Security Law was put in place in Hong Kong, we can see a lot of people censoring themselves,” Lee said. “They are afraid their friends and family would be affected.”

Lee said its “very likely” the people taking pictures “work for the Chinese state and they want to create some terror.”

Hong Kongers are all living a double life in Canada Lee, said. “We have our life as a normal citizen…but then we are living a second life, concerning what's happening from where we came from.”

Carvin said one of the most successful tactics foreign governments use when it comes to intimidation is the fact “people feel very alone.”

“They feel like they have no one to turn to…that feeling of isolation makes them more vulnerable,” she said. “The best you can do is contact the police, but often those threats come from overseas, so there's very little enforcement that can be done.”

“I do not feel safe here,” Wong said. “Every decision I make surrounds my own safety…I'm worried when I send a text message to my family back home that that message would contain something that would endanger my family's safety.”

Wong said she knows of activist colleagues who have been violently beaten on the streets overseas because they “were walking home alone.”

“I'm afraid that would happen to me and I don't think the police or the government could protect me from that kind of violent attack,” she said.

Despite living in Canada, Wong said that activists like her are afraid to go outside and to protests, as once their photographs are taken, someone “pays a visit” to their families overseas.

“They’ll say ‘your cousin or your daughter just came to this protest, you should tell them to stop,” she said.

OPERATION FOX HUNT

The intimidation tactics the activists describe are part and parcel of the playbook used by CCP agents in service of missions like “Operation Fox Hunt,” which has been running since at least 2015 and is operated by Beijing’s Ministry of Public Security.

Operation Fox Hunt originally was part of China’s anti-corruption crackdown to hunt down party officials labelled as “corrupt” who fled the mainland in droves.

But FBI Director Christopher Wray said in Oct. 2020 that the core mission had changed to include a “sweeping bid by General Secretary Xi and the CCP to target Chinese nationals” globally “who are viewed as threats to the regime.”

The comments came as the FBI announced charges against eight people, including three Chinese nationals, accused of “acting at the direction and under control of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) government…to harass, stalk, and coerce residents of the U.S. to return to the PRC as part of a global, concerted, and extralegal repatriation effort known as “Operation Fox Hunt,” according to a press release.

The release details the tactics used against the U.S. victim, named only as John Doe.

Agents coerced John Doe’s elderly father to travel from China to New York to use his surprise presence “to threaten and attempt to coerce John Doe’s return to the mainland.” Other agents harassed John Doe’s daughter over social media and attempted to hire a private investigator to find out her location in order to photograph her to exert pressure on her father, according to the release.

In the 2020 security report released by CSIS, the agency confirms that a “significant concern are activities by threat actors affiliated with the People’s Republic of China” that seek to “leverage and exploit critical freedoms” from communities who often “fear state-backed or state-linked retribution targeting both themselves and possibly their loved ones in Canada and abroad.”

In a statement to CTVNews.ca, CSIS said that that fear “can force individuals to submit to foreign interference.”

The organization reiterated that such actions by China and other state actors are illegal and are an attempt to “undermine Canada’s sovereignty.”

In a public speech to the Centre for International Governance Innovation in February, CSIS chief David Vigneault reiterated the danger posed by China, telling Canadians they are being “aggressively” targeted by “activities that are a direct threat to our national security and sovereignty.”

Vigneault acknowledged Operation Fox Hunt’s presence in Canada, “which claims to target corruption but is also believed to have been used to target and quiet dissidents to the regime,” he said.

Carvin said the fact that Vigneault publically named China marks a big shift in the intelligence community, calling it “a huge change.”

“This is done carefully,” she said. “When an agency actually names the actor engaged in malicious activity, they have to coordinate across government and get high levels of approval - it's effectively making foreign policy if you're accusing another country of hurting you.”

Carvin said the way Canada’s intelligence agencies have talked about security for the past two decades is changing to recognize “the long game” is the “threat to our economy and intellectual property from foreign interference.”

“The goal is to not just amplify Beijing's views, but to suppress anyone who speaks out against those views,” she said.

Vigneault also said in his speech that those who feel threatened by China’s attempts to silence dissension can report instances to law enforcement agencies – but Wong said the resources are simply not there.

“We have been screaming and yelling about how we are being bounced between departments with not one single person taking us seriously - that feeling is exactly why our community has given up on reporting these types of incidents,” Wong said.

The RCMP has touted their National Security Information Network hotline as a direct way Hong Kongers can report harassment, but Wong pointed out that the community can’t access the resource as “the information is not available in our languages.”

In Wong’s case – she “did what she was supposed to do” and called Vancouver police and filed a police report, but she said the response was, “there was nothing they could do.”

“I never even met the responding officers who came to the hotel… I was feeling unsafe in that hotel room for hours before my own community members were able to come and sit with me,” she said, adding that she has never received an update or follow-up on the incident.

In an emailed statement to CTVNews.ca the RCMP declined to answer specific questions about the activists’ allegations, writing that the agency is “aware of foreign actor interference activity in Canada, from China and other foreign states.”

The RCMP would not go into specifics but said “various methods and techniques are in place to combat foreign actor interference.”

‘HIJACKING PATRIOTISM’

Lee says part of the pressure that Canadian Hong-Kongers face is messaging from the CCP that regardless of their passport of nationality, they are “Chinese first.”

“When the Chinese government is in our faces saying that we are first and foremost a Chinese, whether or not you hold a Canadian passport, it's really stepping on our rights being a Canadian,” Lee said. “If the Canadian government is not doing anything to protect us from that message, you see how the Chinese government is effectively ‘ruling’ over the globe, even though we are not on Chinese land.”

Executive Director of Community Family Services Ontario Anna V. Wong (no relation to Cherie Wong) says that the CCP messaging of being “Chinese first” is part of a wider discourse the party uses to justify its actions in Hong Kong and in Canada.

“By imposing an identity onto someone, it’s meant to show them that this [country] is not secure, they want everybody to believe they belong to them,” Anna Wong said, adding that she identifies as a Canadian who was born in Hong Kong.

“I don’t identify myself as a CCP Chinese and I would say this is a hijacking process of the concept of patriotism,” she said.

Among the CCP messaging being dispersed globally is the reality of the crackdown on dual nationality within Hong Kong’s new political and social landscape.

In February, a dual citizen of Canada and China who has been held prisoner in Hong Kong was recently forced to choose between their two nationalities, Global Affairs Canada said, an escalation of tactics used by the CCP for some time.

After the U.K. announced a special pathway to citizenship for Hong Kongers who hold a British National (Overseas) passport, China retaliated by promptly derecognizing the specially-issued passports as valid travel documents.

Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam also confirmed in February that dual nationality was not recognised in Hong Kong, in line with Chinese nationality regulations – meaning Hong Kongers with dual nationality were no longer entitled to foreign consular assistance.

Global Affairs Canada recommends that any dual nationals looking for help from the government in Hong Kong never identify themselves as Chinese, and instead should “present themselves as Canadian to authorities at all times.”

The Chinese embassy in Ottawa did not answer queries on specific allegations levelled by the activists, responding with a one-line response to CTVNews.ca that “such allegation has no factual basis at all, it is nothing but self-hype and malicious slanders, attempting to sabotage prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Xizang [sic].”

‘YOU CAN NEVER GO HOME’

While Hong Kongers have been scrambling to take advantage of the government’s new pathway to Canada, many here are struggling with their own complex feelings of saying goodbye to Hong Kong – a place they say they no longer recognize under CCP rule.

“I can for sure tell you I won't go back to this place…it's not the place that I know - Hong Kong is a DNA that comes with the package of values, including freedom, human rights, freedom of press, freedom of speech,” Anna Wong said.

Cherie Wong said the day the national security law was implemented was the day that she accepted she will “never go home again.”

“I want to say I’m sad, but really I'm angry,” she said. “I am more angry than I've ever felt before. The regime took away my family's home, my grandparent’s home, and now they have taken away my home. It's a motivator for me to keep on doing the work I do, but knowing that I can never go home again, it's soul crushing.”

Wong said the threats facing Hong Kongers in Canada are from the same source, just in different forms.

“In Hong Kong, they live in fear that the door knock that they are hearing is the police coming to come and arrest them,” she said. “Here the fear is a slow-burning kind.”

“I don't want to discourage any Hong Konger from coming here… but don’t think that once you're here, you're free - there's nothing stopping the regime from coming after you here, just the conditions are different.”

Others pro-democracy activists have echoed the same grim warnings.

“When you come over to Canada, don't think that you're going to have a good life in terms of getting away from the Chinese government's arm, because we have so much infiltration and interference from the Chinese government - our fight is even more important,” Lee said.

A member of the Halifax Hong Kong Link said they do not want Hong Kongers to “regret” their decision to leave, but said it will come at a cost.

“If you have decided to come to Canada, you have to know you cannot go back.”

I just hope he remembered all the good I’ve done for him and how faithfully I’ve executed his vision over the years, and doesn’t get swayed by some of these johnny-come-lately Republicans who only started working for him in his final years. I think there’s enough to go around, but I hope they read it quickly before more people get here and it starts getting contentious—oh, great, [Israeli prime minister Benjamin] Netanyahu just showed up.” At press time, Cornyn was trying to hide his frustration after the executor announced Adelson had willed him Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign.

It’s 2020 for goodness’ sake, how are we allowing something that happened in Indiana, Oklahoma, Virginia, California, Delaware, and 25 other states throughout the 20th century to continue to happen here?” At press time, Baker added that this felt like something that could only happen in Nazi Germany after having been inspired by the American eugenics program.

0,Iran rejects claim Ukraine’s plane shot down intentionally,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/17/iran-rejects-claim-ukraines-plane-was-shot-down-intentionally,"Ukraine is trying to gain political points by making assertions over its downed plane in Tehran, Iran says.

Tehran, Iran – Iran’s foreign ministry has “strongly rejected” the Ukrainian security chief’s assertion that the shooting down of a passenger plane last year was intentional, accusing him of politicising the issue.

Foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said on Saturday it is unfortunate that Ukrainian officials continue to publicly air “personal and bespoke hypotheses” despite technical reports offered by Iran.

He said it appears Ukraine is not after resolving the case of Flight PS752, whose downing killed all 176 people on board, and wishes to make political gains by “linking this painful accident with its local issues or foreign affairs with other countries”.

The comments come after Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, said the incident was a “conscious attack” that may have been aimed at preventing the United States from attacking Iran.

The Ukraine International Airlines flight was shot down with two missiles fired from an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp air defence system in early January 2020, hours after Iran fired missiles at two US bases in neighbouring Iraq.

The attack on US interests was in response to the assassination of Qassem Soleimani, Iran’s top general, in a drone strike ordered days earlier by then-President Donald Trump.

Iran’s final technical report on the downing of the plane said last month “human error” was responsible as a surface-to-air missile defence system near the Imam Khomeini International Airport had not been recalibrated after being moved shortly before the incident, so it mistook the plane for a “hostile object”.

Even as all flights to Iraq and those scheduled to fly over the western parts of the country had been cancelled, the report said, the risk of misidentification of commercial flights, and flights from the Tehran airport was deemed to be low.

Ukraine at the time called the report a “cynical attempt to hide the true reasons for the downing of our plane”.

Tehran ready for talks

The Iranian foreign ministry spokesman also said in his statement Iran is ready to hold more talks with all aggrieved sides within the framework of international law and called on them to refrain from “exiting the framework of logic and law” in their remarks.

A spokesman of Iran’s National Security Council also rejected Danilov’s claim, saying he met Iran’s security chief Ali Shamkhani shortly after the incident and was presented with “comprehensive technical explanations”.

Keyvan Khosravi said several investigations conducted by Iranian authorities have since “decisively refuted any other possibilities or theories” except the accidental shooting down of the plane.

Iran’s government in January set a compensation of $150,000 for each victim’s family.

Earlier this month, a military prosecutor said 10 unnamed officials who were involved in the incident have been indicted and will head to court soon.",474,3032,8,58

0,Philippines commits to 75% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030,https://www.bworldonline.com/philippines-commits-to-75-reduction-in-greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-2030/,"President Rodrigo R. Duterte has approved the Philippines’ first Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) which aims to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 75% by 2030, the Finance department said on Friday.

The five-page NDC details the country’s goal of modernizing and pursuing low carbon and resilient development for the agriculture, waste, industry, transport and energy sectors over a ten-year period beginning 2020.

“The target is based on the country’s projected business-as-usual cumulative economy-wide emission of 3,340.3 metric tons (MT) of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) for the same period,” the Department of Finance said in a statement.

Of the 75% target, some 72.29% will be conditional or dependent on the support of climate finance, technologies and capacity development which is set to be provided by developed countries. The rest of the target will be implemented through domestic resources.

NDCs are at the heart of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which seeks to limit the global temperature rise to preferably below 1.5 degrees Celsius. NDCs detail the efforts of countries in reducing emissions and adapting to the impacts of climate change.

Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III, who is the chairman-designate of the Climate Change Commission (CCC), described the country’s NDC target as “ambitious.” The CCC facilitated the formulation of the NDC.

“The NDC will be our tool to upgrade our economy by adopting modern and low carbon technologies and approaches that would help mitigate the climate crisis and make our economy more resilient and our growth sustainable,” he was quoted as saying.

Based on the NDC registry of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Philippines is the latest country that has submitted its NDC, as of Thursday.

‘ACHIEVABLE’

Nazrin Camille D. Castro, manager of the Philippine branch of global non-profit The Climate Reality Project, said that the NDC will enable the country to unlock new sources of climate finance “that will help the just and equitable transition away from coal, oil, gas, and fossil fuel-based energy systems.”

“The 75% GHG reduction and avoidance target is achievable if the government could come up with formidable and bankable climate change mitigation and adaptation projects that will enable us to access international climate finance mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund,” Ms. Castro told BusinessWorld in an e-mail interview on Friday.

She added the country’s ability to reach the NDC target depends on the public and private sector’s efforts in building back better, an opportunity which the global health emergency has presented.

Albert A. Magalang, Chief of Climate Change Service at the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, said that the target is “high and ambitious”, but its fulfillment will mostly depend on support from other countries.

“The achievement of the Philippines’ 75% target would mainly depend on the support and the means of implementation that will be provided to the country as most of the mitigation target is conditional,” Mr. Magalang told BusinessWorld in an e-mail interview on Friday.

“The global health emergency may affect the level of support that will be provided from the developed countries but on the other hand, the global emissions may have also (been) reduced due to low economic activity during the pandemic,” he said, in response to a question on whether the country can reach its target given the pandemic.

Meanwhile, environment group Greenpeace Philippines described the target as “underwhelming.”

“It’s disappointing that despite strong calls from the public and environmental groups, the government barely made changes from the underwhelming target of 75% conditional and 2.71 percent unconditional emissions reduction by 2030,” Greenpeace campaigner Khevin Yu said, referring to the draft presented during the 2nd NDC Multistakeholder Consultation held in February.

“With unambitious plans for carbon-intensive sectors, the commitment does not reflect the urgency needed to address the climate emergency,” he added.

On Friday, the DoF said that crafting the NDC followed a “rigorous” process, which included economic modeling analyses, expert reviews and consultations with various stakeholders from the public, private and civil society sectors.",663,4363,11,72

Nearly 6K fully vaccinated Americans got COVID-19 – out of 66 million: CDC

Approximately 5,800 fully vaccinated Americans — out of 66 million who received the shots — still became infected with COVID-19, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data reported Thursday.

The infections, dubbed breakthrough cases — or positive test results that occur at least two weeks after a person gets their final coronavirus vaccine dose — represents about 0.008 percent of Americans who are fully vaccinated, the Wall Street Journal reported.

The federal agency found 29 percent of breakthrough infections were asymptomatic, while 7 percent led to hospitalization. So far, 74 people have died from breakthrough infections — but it’s not clear which vaccine they received, if the patients came from high-risk groups or if there were any other circumstances contributing to the deaths.

More than 40 percent of the breakthrough cases, which come from only 40 states, occurred in people over the age of 60, and 65 percent of those infected were women, the CDC told the outlet.

The CDC is expected to publish findings on the breakthrough infections next week, the outlet reported.

On Thursday, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky testified on Capitol Hill on what may be causing the breakthrough infections, saying the agency is “keeping a close eye” on the cases.

“Some of these breakthroughs are, of course, failures of an immune response in the host and then some of them, we are worried might be related to a variant that is circulating, so we’re looking at both,” Walensky said.

Health officials have said breakthrough infections are expected because none of the vaccines currently approved for distribution are 100 percent effective.

“You will always see some breakthrough infections no matter the efficacy of your vaccine,” Dr. Anthony Fauci told the outlet.

“Before people get excited about the quantitative number of infections, they need to understand what the denominator is, and we’re going to see breakthroughs in numbers that are going to be well within the 90 percent, 95 percent, 97 percent effectiveness rates of the vaccines.”

There are a number of reasons why people can become infected after they’re fully vaccinated, David Hirschwerk, a physician in infectious diseases for Northwell Health System, told the WSJ.

People who are older or those with compromised immune systems may not be able to launch a robust immune response to the vaccine and build up enough antibodies to ward off infections, the doctor explained.

In other situations, new variants, some of which have been found to be more transmissible, can circumvent the vaccine’s protections. And other times, a patient could just be exposed to a particularly heavy viral load during a superspreader event, for example, the outlet said.

“The experience so far is that the vaccine remains highly effective and those who did have breakthrough infections have had very mild and manageable illnesses,” Hirschwerk, who has treated a patient with a breakthrough infection, told the WSJ.

“This is really what we see each season with the influenza vaccine.”

The CDC plans to conduct genomic sequencing on respiratory samples taken from patients with breakthrough infections to get a better understanding of the role variants are playing and how they hold up against the vaccines.

But there’s no getting around the fact that the economy is hurting, and the best way to help is by mandating that all Americans send money to senators and the Pentagon directly. This was also a bipartisan effort, a compromise reached after Democrats wanted you to send $1,600 and Republicans wanted you to send $1,200. We hope that during this difficult time, all Americans will appreciate that extra $1,200 out of their pocketbooks and into our hands.” The stimulus bill also reportedly includes significant provisions targeted at helping small businesses close.

The bill is led by House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry Nadler, subcommittee Chair Hank Johnson, and first-term Rep. Mondaire Jones. In the Senate, the bill is being championed by Ed Markey of Massachusetts.

Congressional Democrats plan to unveil legislation expanding the size of the Supreme Court on Thursday, according to three congressional sources familiar with the closely held measure.

The number of justices on the court, which is set by Congress, has fluctuated throughout the course of the nation’s history, reaching as many as 10 seats before settling on nine in 1869. In 2016, Sen. Ted Cruz suggested that if Hillary Clinton were elected, the Republican Senate should keep Justice Antonin Scalia’s seat empty, effectively bringing the number of justices down to eight.

Republicans currently hold six seats, while Democrats hold just three. Republicans were able to solidify control of the court under former President Donald Trump, after first refusing to advance Merrick Garland’s nomination under former President Barack Obama and then confirming Justice Neil Gorsuch after Trump’s election. Then after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died last September, Republicans threw out the procedures they had previously embraced and confirmed Justice Amy Coney Barrett in a matter of weeks.

After Trump’s nomination of Barrett, then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer faced pressure to stop her confirmation by any means necessary. When those myriad options fell short and Barrett was pushed through, the conversation turned to expanding the court.

“Not only do these extremist judges threaten more than a century of progressive achievements,” read a letter to Schumer by 20 New York elected officials, “they threaten to foreclose the possibility of any future progress under a Democratic administration.”",294,1913,10,57
